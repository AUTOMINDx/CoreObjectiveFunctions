It can be difficult to make exercise a habit, especially if you haven't been active for a while. Starting slowly and gradually increasing your activity level can be a good way to ease into it. Finding an activity that you enjoy can also help make it more fun and encourage you to stick with it. And finally, setting realistic goals is important so that you don't get discouraged if you don't meet them right away.
