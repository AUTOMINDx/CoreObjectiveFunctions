Pathological narcissism is about using maladaptive methods to regulate self esteem. Recovery happens when your self esteem is being regulated adaptively, when you feel happy, fulfilled, and content in life. The urges to manipulate or hurt people will be much less frequent and you wonâ€™t feel a strong need to act on them once you are recovered. A recovered narcissist that has good behavioural regulation is more healthy than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.
