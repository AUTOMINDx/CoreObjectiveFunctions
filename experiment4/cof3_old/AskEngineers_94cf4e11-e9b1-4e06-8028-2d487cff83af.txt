The Reddit user asks if they should continue to intervening with a company after finding out that their salary is not anywhere near COL. COL refers to the cost of living. It is important to consider the cost of living when looking for a new job because it can affect your quality of life. If you are considering taking a job that is in a different location, it is important to do your research. Look into the cost of living in that area and see how it compares to the salary that the company is offering. It is also important to consider what this decision could mean for your career. Will taking this job look bad on your resume? Will it burn bridges with potential future employers? These are all things to think about before making a decision. Talk to professionals in your industry, or people who have already been in your position, to get their advice.
