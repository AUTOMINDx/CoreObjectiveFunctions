At first, it may seem like the user is feeling extremely unhappy and wants to completely erase their identity and start over. Upon closer inspection, it seems that the user is simply feeling uncomfortable in their current situation and would like to find a way to become more content. It's possible that the user has felt this way for most of their life, but only recently realized it. This could be due to changes occurring during puberty, or any other event that made them take a closer look at their life. The user may feel that they cannot be happy until they become a different person. This is not an uncommon feeling, and there are many ways to address it.
