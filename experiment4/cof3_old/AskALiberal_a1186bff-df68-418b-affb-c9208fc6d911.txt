One user said that they would give a eulogy for BBB, and in it, they would say "Here's to BBB. The bastard had the worst bodyguards. Thanks to CPC for giving up all leverage. Thanks to Biden for being incredibly good at shooting himself in the foot. Ty to corporatism for creating a very vulnerable economy. Ty to bat or petri dish that decided to f*ck us all up, economically and biologically. Peace I'm out." This user seems disgruntled with BBB, and blames it for many things. Some of these things may be accurate, but it is important to have a full understanding of what BBB is and what it does before making any judgements.
