From the utility company's message, it sounds like your service is an old direct buried service (not in conduit) that was damaged by the tornado. The damage will need to be fixed by an electrician to code (with conduit) before the utility company can restore power to your home. It sounds like the guys attempted to make contact this morning and were not able to reach anyone, so they left a message. You can call in the morning and speak to an engineer, or go ahead and procure an electrician and they will know what to do. It's unclear if having the service fixed will be expensive or if it will take longer than expected. Displacement is also a possibility, but it sounds like there is some hope you will have power within 48 hours. It's always helpful to get clarifying information from experts, so please feel free to ask any questions you have about this situation in the comments below!
