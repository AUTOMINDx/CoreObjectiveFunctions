Some people believe that charismatic people with high emotional intelligence are fake and manipulative. However, others believe that they are simply empaths who are able to connect with other people easily. It can be difficult to tell the difference, but there are some ways to tell if a person is manipulating you. If a person only seems interested in you when you can benefit them in some way, or if they always know what to say to make you feel good, then they may be manipulating you. genuine empathy is when a person cares about people for no reason other than wanting to connect with them. If someone seems to only care about themselves, then they are not being empathetic.
