Based on the information provided, it seems that the 30 m husband almost definitely has COVID. He was double vaccinated by April 2021 and has not received a booster yet. His fever is 102.5 while on alternating doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen every four hours. He is in near tears from the body pain, shivering, alternating feeling overheated and chilled, disoriented and terrified. The Reddit user is worried about the 30 m husband because he has a high tolerance for pain and is currently experiencing a lot of pain. Additionally, there is an outbreak of COVID at the Reddit user's work and at their 7 year old's school. The Reddit user's 7 year old son has already tested positive for COVID. Thanks for asking for help!
