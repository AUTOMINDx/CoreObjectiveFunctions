It sounds like the user is conflicted about whether to agree to their dad's request to spend Christmas together. On one hand, the user is grateful that their dad has agreed not to drink alcohol during Christmas. On the other hand, the user worries that this may only be a temporary concession and they also feel conflicted because they don't want to be under the terms and conditions set by their dad. It would be helpful to ask more questions in order to gain a better understanding of the situation. For example, why did the user's dad agree not to drink alcohol during Christmas? What does the user think their dad's end goal is in making this request? Are there any other ways that the user could communicate with their dad besides email?
