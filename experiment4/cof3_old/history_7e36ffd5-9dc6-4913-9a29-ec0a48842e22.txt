Reddit user's question about knights and squires in the 14th-15th centuries raises several interesting points. In order to increase understanding of this topic, some gaps in knowledge need to be filled. First, it is important to understand the difference between a knight and a squire. A knight is a man who has been awarded a knighthood, usually for military service or heroism. A squire is an apprentice knight, someone who is training to become a knight. Second, it is unclear what constitutes eligibility to become a knight. Some say that military service is the only prerequisite, while others claim that birth into a noble family is necessary. In practice, it seems that either of these factors could be important, depending on the situation. Finally, it should be noted that the rank of knight and squire can vary from place to place and from century to century. Therefore, any generalizations about this topic should be taken with a grain of salt
