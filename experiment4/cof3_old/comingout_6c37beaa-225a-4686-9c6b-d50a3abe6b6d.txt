It sounds like it's been difficult for you to have your identity recognized by your mother. I can understand why that would be upsetting. It seems like she is not making an effort to use your correct pronouns, which can be hurtful. It's important to remember that change takes time, and your mother might need more time to adjust than others. You could try sitting down with her and having a conversation about how you're feeling, and how important it is to you for her to use your correct pronouns. If she still refuses, you could find someone else in your life who will support you in your journey of self-discovery.
