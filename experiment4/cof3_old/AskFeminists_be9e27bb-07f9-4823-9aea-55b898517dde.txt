There are a number of reforms that could be made to the law in order to increase the number of convicted rapists. One potential reform would be to create a more supportive environment for victims who come forward with their stories. This could involve increasing funding for victim support services, as well as increasing penalties for offenders who intimidate or harass victims. Another potential reform would be to change the way evidence is collected and evaluated in sexual assault cases. This could include training police officers and prosecutors on how to better handle sexual assault cases, as well as implementing new technologies that can help to track down assailants.
