According to this Reddit user, skilled people have a moral obligation to emigrate from their country of origin if that country is inevitably going to collapse. They argue that this is because doing so will hasten the country's eventual collapse, and therefore also its eventual rehabilitation. I am interested in what this subreddit thinks about this claim. Do you agree? Or do you think that there are other factors to consider?
