There are four different metrics that should exist if magnetic monopoles exist: mass not equal to zero, magnetic charge not equal to zero, electric charge not equal to zero, and angular momentum not equal to zero. Each of these metrics would be a different case than the standard Schwarzschild, Kerr, Reissner-Nordstr√∂m, and Kerr-Newman metrics. However, if only the case where all metric values are non-zero has a specific name, then I understand that.
