It sounds like you are very grieving for your daughter who passed away. It is understandable that you want to keep her memory alive and talk about her all the time. It is also understandable that your daughter would want a day that is about her and not her sister who passed away. Memorial tables or seats are a way to do both. You can talk about your daughter who passed away and have a place for her at the event. Your daughter is right that she should be able to have a day that is only about her. It is possible to have both things happen at the same time.
