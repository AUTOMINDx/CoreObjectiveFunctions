It sounds like you feel misunderstood by your loved ones when it comes to your anxiety. It can be difficult to understand and cope with anxiety if you haven't experienced it yourself. It sounds like you have tried to explain how debilitating the experience can be, but they still don't quite understand. One thing that might help is to continue trying to express yourself in a way that they can understand. Use examples or analogies that they will be able to relate to. For instance, if you feel like they think you're using anxiety as an excuse, try explaining how it feels when an attack hits. Take into account their perspective and what might make the most sense to them. If they are still having a hard time understanding, consider finding a support group or meeting with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders. This can provide more education about the condition and allow you to talk about your experiences with people who will understand them.
