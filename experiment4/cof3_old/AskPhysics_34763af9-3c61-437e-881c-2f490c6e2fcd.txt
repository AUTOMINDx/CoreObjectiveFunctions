Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a branch of quantum mechanics that deals with the field aspect of particles. In contrast to quantum mechanics, which only deals with the properties of single particles, QFT takes into account the interactions between particles. Each field in QFT is described by a set of mathematical equations that allow us to track the interactions between particles. These equations are necessary because of the many-body problem, which describes the issues that arise when dealing with more than one particle. The use of quantum fields allows us to simplify our calculations by treating each field as a single entity. While these fields are abstractions, they are necessary to accurately describe the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics.
