There is a scene in the movie Napoleon, where Napoleon uses a French flag as a sail to escape from Corsica to France. This scene is based on historical accounts, but it is unclear how much of the "historical record" that it references is scholarly history, and how much is either legend-making or taken from more subjective sources. The sequence in the movie is extremely powerful, which makes me wonder if it's just great storytelling or if it's an instance of the craft rising to the scale of the subject matter.
