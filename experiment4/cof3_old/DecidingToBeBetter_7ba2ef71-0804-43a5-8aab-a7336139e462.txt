The Reddit user describes an incident where they stopped themselves from self harming, but felt like punching a metal locker. They explain that they took off their ring for good luck, but then their cat saw them and walked up to them. The user explains that they were unable to get out of bed until the cat wanted affection, so they gave it to her. They then say that they thought about how self harming doesn't help and instead do something that helps like taking the anti depressant on time. They go on to say that they called up their friend and talked to him for 5 minutes. The user ends their post by saying that it was a win to them.
