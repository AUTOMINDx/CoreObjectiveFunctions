When I read the original post, I could understand why the user was upset. It can be hurtful when we are deceived by someone we care about. I can also understand why the user might be feeling love for this person, even after finding out about the deception. It is common for us to want to excuse the behavior of those we care about. One thing that I am curious about is why the user thought this man might be on the autism spectrum. If you have any ideas about this, it would be helpful to share them in the comments.
