It sounds like you have been through a lot in your life. It is important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it is not necessarily indicative of your future success or ability to do graduate level work. I would encourage you to pursue a BS in computer science, as it will help you in your career goals. The MS and PhD in computer science or computational linguistics are also attainable goals, and you should not let your previous mistake stop you from pursuing them. Admissions committees are likely to overlook one failed attempt, especially if you can show that you have recovered and learned from the experience. Remember that it is never too late to achieve your goals.
