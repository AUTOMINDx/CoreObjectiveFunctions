Reddit user says: What is the reception of Sean Carroll in academic philosophy? Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist who made a name for himself through advocacy of "naturalism" (i.e. physicalism, I think) through public lectures and a few high-profile debates since the "wave" of the 2000s that also included people like Dawkins and Harris. Apparently, he has "successfully" (for some measure) debated Craig, whom I consider an academic philosopher, and also Raymond Moody, who does have a PhD in philosophy but, for those in the know, is probably more familiar for his work as a doctor and researcher of near-death experiences. I have a hard time understanding how he could score any points in a philosophical debate on an academic level, though if success is measured by convincing a lay audience, then I might imagine that he could sway a few minds. To me, he frankly seems to be sort of a whack
