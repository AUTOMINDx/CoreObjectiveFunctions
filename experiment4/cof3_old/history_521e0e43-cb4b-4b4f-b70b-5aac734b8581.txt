It is interesting to think about the mindset of generals throughout history. Do they feel guilty when their mistakes lead to the deaths of many soldiers? Some may, while others may not be able to sympathize with the losses they have caused. For example, in Russia, Napoleon's Grande Armee was decimated after his poor decision making. Did he feel guilty? In another case, Operation Market Garden was a failure and many Allied soldiers were killed. Montgomery has been criticized for this operation, but did he feel guilty? There isn't a lot of written material exploring this topic, but it would be interesting to explore further.
