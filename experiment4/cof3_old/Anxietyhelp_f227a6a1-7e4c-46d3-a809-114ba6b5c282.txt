It sounds like you have been experiencing this woozy feeling for a long time and it has been impacting your life in a significant way. You have seen multiple doctors to try and find out what is causing this feeling, but have not been able to find any answers. It is reasonable to feel anxious when you are dealing with an issue that you don't have any control over. It can be helpful to talk to a psychiatrist about how you are feeling and see if there are any other strategies that can help you manage your symptoms.
