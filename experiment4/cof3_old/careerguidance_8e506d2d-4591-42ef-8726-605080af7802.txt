It sounds like you are feeling frustrated because you have a lot of experience and expertise in your field, but when you look for jobs, the descriptions always ask for someone who can manage a team. It's tiring to have to deal with someone who is a slacker or needs to be micromanaged, and it feels like you might be limiting yourself if you apply for a job that is lower than you are currently qualified for. Are there any other perspectives on this that you would like to explore?
