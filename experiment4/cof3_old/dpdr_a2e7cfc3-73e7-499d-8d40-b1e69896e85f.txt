There are many different hormones that are associated with stress, and cortisol is one of the most well-known. Cortisol is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it constricts blood vessels. This could lead to less blood flow to the brain, which could have a variety of negative consequences such as reduced brain function, learning and memory issues, balance problems, and more. The main way to reduce cortisol is through exercise. However, the type of exercise makes a difference. Light exercise, such as walking, lowers cortisol levels. On the other hand, moderate to high intensity exercise raises cortisol levels. It is important to note that light exercise may help reduce cortisol levels. Additionally, yoga has been shown to be very effective at reducing cortisol and anxiety levels. So, it may be worth considering starting yoga if you are looking for ways to reduce your stress levels.
