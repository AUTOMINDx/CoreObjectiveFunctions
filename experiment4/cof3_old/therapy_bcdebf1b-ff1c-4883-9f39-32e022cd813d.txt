It sounds like you have been finding that your therapist is not a good fit for you. You say that you are going to start looking for another one soon and that you think she is a nice lady and means well. However, you don't feel like you can be yourself around her or feel safe in the space. This may be for many reasons, but it doesn't sound like it would be a good fit for you. You ask how to tell her in the kindest way possible that you will be moving on. It's important to do what is best for you and what will make you most comfortable. You don't want to hurt her feelings, but it is also important that both of you feel comfortable with the ending of the relationship. There is no right answer, but it's important to remember that this is about what is best for you. Thank you for asking!
