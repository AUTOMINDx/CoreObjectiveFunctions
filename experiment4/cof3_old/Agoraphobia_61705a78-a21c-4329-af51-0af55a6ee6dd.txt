So congratulations on your progress! It sounds like going to this town near you has been a big accomplishment. It's great that your boyfriend was able to come visit and that you were able to have a good time. I'm happy to hear that you only had one little attack and that it wasn't too bad. Your next goal of going to the eye doctor is definitely something worth worrying about, but if you take it slow and steady I'm sure you'll be fine. Thanks for sharing your inspirational story!
