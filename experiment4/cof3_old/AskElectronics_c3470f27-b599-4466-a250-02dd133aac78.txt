It appears that the user is asking if a dual-port SRAM is an appropriate way to interface a microcontroller with a Gameboy, in order to emulate a cartridge. The user has watched a video about someone who made a WiFi-enabled Gameboy cartridge with an ESP32. The person in the video solved the problem of being unable to run microcontrollers fast enough to have enough MCU clock cycles to do anything useful between GB CPU memory cycles by storing the bulk of the code on an EEPROM. However, this has the unfortunate side effect of the MCU being unable to go bit-fiddling in the EEPROM. The user suggests using a dual-port SRAM module as an alternative, as it would allow the MCU to update all of the code at will or just go bit-fiddling to change some values. The user wonders if there is something they are not seeing here.
