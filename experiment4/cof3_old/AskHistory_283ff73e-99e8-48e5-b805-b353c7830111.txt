According to this Reddit user, Tsarist Russia and Imperial China had a relatively unknown relationship during the 15th to 19th centuries. Tsarist Russia was mostly interested in its own internal affairs and did not care too much about China, while China saw Russia as a barbaric and backwards country. However, there were some instances of cooperation between the two empires, such as when Russia helped China suppress the Boxer Rebellion. Overall, the two empires had a tense relationship but did not engage in any major conflicts with each other.
