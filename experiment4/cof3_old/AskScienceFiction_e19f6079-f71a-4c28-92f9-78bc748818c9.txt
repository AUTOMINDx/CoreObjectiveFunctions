Reddit user says: [Marvel] Who is more accurate, Bullseye or Hawkeye? Both Bullseye and Hawkeye are accurate shooters, but Bullseye has more ridiculous accuracy feats. However, I haven’t looked into Hawkeye’s top tier feats to see if he can compete with Bullseye. It’s possible that Hawkeye is just as accurate as Bullseye, but his morality and preference for a bow prevents him from pulling off the same feats as Bullseye.
