When it comes to astrology, it seems that there are many things that people do not understand. In particular, the concepts of rising signs and sun signs can be confusing. Rising signs are said to reflect the way in which a person is seen by others, while sun signs indicate the personality of a person. It is said that people with the same rising sign tend to attract each other, while those with different sun signs tend to compete with each other. There seems to be a lot of debate on this topic, with people having different experiences. Some people find that they attract those with the same rising sign, while others find that they attract those with different sun signs. Some people make friends with their rising sign, while others make enemies or frenemies.
