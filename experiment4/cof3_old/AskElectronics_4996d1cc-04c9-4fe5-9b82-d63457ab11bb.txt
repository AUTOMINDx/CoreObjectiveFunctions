It is unclear what type of solder is used in modern game controllers. Some solder melts at a lower temperature, so a higher-temperature iron may be needed to desolder it. However, if the solder is not heated for long enough, it can potentially reattach to the surface. In this case, clipping the sticks clean off the board and then using the iron to clean out the holes may be more successful.
