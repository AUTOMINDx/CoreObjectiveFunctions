There are several possible explanations for why Jesus is a common name in Latin America but not in Spain. One possibility is that the tradition of naming children after saints is more common in Latin America than in Spain. Another possibility is that the Catholic Church has a stronger presence in Latin America than in Spain. A third possibility is that the culture of Spain is less influenced by Christianity than the culture of Latin America.
