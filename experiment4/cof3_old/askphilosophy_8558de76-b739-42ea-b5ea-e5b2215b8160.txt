In light of climate change, the ethical considerations of air travel are complicated. On one hand, emissions from air travel are a comparatively small portion of global emissions when compared to other forms of transportation or energy production. On the other hand, air travel is growing rapidly and is becoming an increasingly significant contributor to climate change. It is worth exploring these ethical considerations further. Some factors to consider might include: the severity of climate change and its potential impact on humans and the environment; the individual's responsibility relative to their overall contribution to climate change; the availability and feasibility of alternative modes of transportation; and personal values and priorities.
