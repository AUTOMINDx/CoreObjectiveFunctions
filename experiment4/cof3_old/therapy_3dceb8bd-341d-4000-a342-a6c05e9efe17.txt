I can understand how it would be difficult to keep fighting when you feel numb and like everything is dull. It sounds like you are trying your best, but sometimes our best isn't enough. I want you to know that it is okay to not be okay, and it is okay to ask for help. There are people that care about you and want to help, even if you don't feel that way right now. There are people that want to see you survive and fight this feeling. Please don't give up.
