It is difficult to believe that some people have positive relationships with their parents, as Reddit user u/ShittiestRedditor has found. It is possible that this is a hoax or something else, as they say, because it is hard to imagine that this is a common experience. People who have good relationships with their parents generally feel loved and supported by them. They also usually learn how to make friends and deal with emotions from them. This does not mean that these people do not experience difficulties in their lives, but they are better equipped to deal with them. Reddit user understands that their experience is not the norm and that it is likely that most people do not have the same positive relationship with their parents as they do. They ask questions about the nature of these relationships and wonder if they are just imaginary. It is crucial to remember that everyone experiences life differently. What may be easy or natural for one person may be difficult or impossible for someone else
