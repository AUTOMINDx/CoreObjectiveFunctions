There is certainly merit to the claim that inflation is not caused by a supply chain crunch, but instead the result of companies taking larger profits. Many studies have shown that prices tend to be raised when businesses perceive an opportunity to make more money. However, there are several factors that may be allowing companies to raise prices without being undercut. Firstly, there is often a lag time between when prices are raised and when consumers can actually find an alternative product. Additionally, many companies have a monopoly or near-monopoly on the products they sell, which allows them to charge more without fear of being undercut. Finally, in times of crisis or high demand, consumers are often willing to pay more for goods and services.
