According to user responses in the comments section, it appears that this has happened in media before. In the Halo franchise, there is a weapon called the "Gravity Hammer" which creates a shockwave that can send enemies flying. In one instance, a character is killed by being hit by a shockwave from the Gravity Hammer that was created several minutes earlier. It's worth noting that stray projectiles in space can have some pretty serious consequences. In real life, there have been instances where satellites have been damaged or destroyed by debris from previous launches. So while it may not always be realistic for a stray projectile to hit something later on, it does have the potential to happen.
