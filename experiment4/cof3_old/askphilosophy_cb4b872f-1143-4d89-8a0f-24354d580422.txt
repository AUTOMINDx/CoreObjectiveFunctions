It seems like you are really passionate about philosophy, and that is great! There are many different fields of philosophy, so you could explore other areas besides academic research. There are many jobs that require philosophical thinking, such as law, journalism, business, and more. You could also continue your education and pursue a PhD in philosophy. The competition in the academic world is definitely tough, but it is not impossible to succeed. Many philosophers who are not professors are still doing importantphilosophical work. I would advise anyone who is seriously considering a career in philosophy to carefully consider their options and do their best in order to achieve their goals.
