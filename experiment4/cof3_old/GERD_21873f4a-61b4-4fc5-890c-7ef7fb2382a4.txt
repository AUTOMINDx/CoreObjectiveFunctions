There is some misunderstanding in this post. It appears that the user is concerned that taking a PPI may worsen their GERD symptoms, when their original complaint was not GERD. However, if the person has gastritis, then taking a PPI may help to determine if stomach acid is the issue causing their bloating. If GERD is the original complaint, then it is possible that the PPI will worsen symptoms in the short-term, but it should improve over time.
