It sounds like you feel exhausted and depressed after working. It's understandable that you would want to take a break and relax when you get home, but it sounds like that's not enough for you. You've been reflecting on this for a while and have come to the conclusion that too much activity leads to your depression. I'm curious - have you ever tried taking more breaks throughout the day, or even working fewer hours? It's possible that you would then have more energy to do things outside of work. Alternatively, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist about your CBT goals. They could help you develop manageable goals and make sure you're staying on track.
