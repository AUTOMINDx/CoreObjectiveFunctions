It sounds like you are in a difficult situation. You graduated with honors and your advisor was helpful, but then a year later his colleague stopped replying to emails and you stopped working on the project. You are now applying to PhD programs and need a letter of recommendation from your advisor. You are worried about how to reach out to him. You could try explaining the situation to him, but be aware that he may be angry at how the project ended. Alternatively, you could ask someone else for a letter of recommendation.
