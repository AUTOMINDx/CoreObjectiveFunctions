In terms of the impact, falling into honey from a great height would likely be worse than falling into water from a great height. Honey is more dense than water and therefore would displace less fluid when the body hits, meaning a greater force would be exerted on the body. Additionally, water has more surface tension than honey, meaning that it would be less able to absorb the energy of the fall.
