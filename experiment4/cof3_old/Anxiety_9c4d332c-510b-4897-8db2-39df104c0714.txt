Reddit user says: Totally so happy today my brother passed from an OD on November 6th and the whole last month has been a literal blurr but since his passing Iâ€™ve just been 100 percent straight up with my nurse practitioner and she had stood by my side and helped. Please keep trying there is help I am glad to hear that your nurse practitioner has been supportive during this difficult time. It sounds like you have been through a lot recently. I hope that you can continue to receive the support you need to get through this tough time.
