In order to increase understanding, it is important to first identify any gaps in knowledge or understanding. In the case of the Reddit user's posts, there are several gaps that need to be filled in. For one, it is not clear why the logic presented does not apply to our universe. Additionally, the Reddit user seems to believe that because the universe is more complex than the other universe mentioned, it must be predetermined. This assumption is unfounded and there is no evidence to support it. Finally, it is worth noting that the Reddit user seems to lack understanding of basic physics principles. This makes it difficult to fully understand the argument being put forth. Hopefully, with a little more explanation, these gaps can be filled in and a productive discussion can ensue.
