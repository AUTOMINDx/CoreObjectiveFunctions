Based on the information in this post, it seems that the user has had difficulty connecting with past therapists, as they have been more akin to friends than professionals. The new therapist that the user is excited about seems to be different, as she plans to be an actionary therapist and give the user practical tools. The first session with this therapist already involved an assignment. The user expresses hope because of this. There are some gaps in understanding in this post. It is not clear what an actionary therapist is or what the definition of a practical tool is. Additionally, it is not clear why the previous therapists were not effective. Clarifying these questions would help increase understanding of this situation.
