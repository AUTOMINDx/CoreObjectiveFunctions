From watching the first few seconds of the ad, you might initially think it's a genuine pro-choice ad featuring genuine pro-choice men. However, the ad takes a turn and the men in the ad state that the only reason they are pro-choice is because they want to have sex with as many women as they want without having to take on the responsibility of fatherhood. The ad is essentially saying that pro-choice men are selfish deadbeats and that this is the only reason men would ever be pro-choice. Obviously, the primary reason men should be pro-choice shouldn't be because they want to have sex with women without becoming a dad (though that is a good plus). However, if men don't want to become dads they can use condoms, get vasectomies, or discuss birth control options with their partners.
