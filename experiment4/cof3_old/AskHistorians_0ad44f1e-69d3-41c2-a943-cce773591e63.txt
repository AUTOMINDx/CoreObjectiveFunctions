It appears that in many classic TV sitcoms, upper middle class families employed a live-in maid. However, it is difficult to say how common this was in America. There are no solid statistics on the matter. It is possible that the maid or butler was on payroll, or they may have been a 1099 employee. Itâ€™s also unclear whether or not these families really had uniforms for their maids or butlers. The maid or butler may have selected their own attire, or the family may have dictating what they wore. Another question that arises is why families stopped employing maids and butlers. It is difficult to say exactly when this change occurred, but it seems to have happened sometime in the late 80s or early 90s. Lastly, it would be interesting to know how much these employees were paid in present day dollars.
