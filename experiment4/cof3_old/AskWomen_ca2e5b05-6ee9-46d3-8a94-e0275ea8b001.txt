To deal with the guilt of cutting people off from your life, it is important to understand the reasons behind your actions. If you have cut someone off because your values don't align, then it is important to reflect on those values and why they are more important to you than the relationship with that person. If you have cut someone off because you don't want their energy in your life, then it is important to understand what kind of energy they were bringing into your life and why it was no longer beneficial for you. Either way, taking the time to reflect on the reasons for your actions can help to lessen the guilt you may be feeling.
