People may consider you selfish for not wanting children, when you did not have the opportunity to be a child yourself. This may be due to the societal pressure to have children, which can be overwhelming for some people. You may feel that you missed out on valuable experiences during your childhood and/or adolescence, and that you would like to enjoy your freedom now. Travelling, getting an education, and being young are all important aspects of life that should not be taken for granted.
