Current salary requirements are often a question asked during an interview. It is a reasonable question for the interviewer to ask, but it is important not to give a number. When responding, you can say that you are flexible if the job is a good fit, and then ask what the range for the position is. This will give you an idea of what to shoot for. If you already have an idea of what you want, don't be afraid to aim high. Information is power, so get the interviewer to give you the information you need.
