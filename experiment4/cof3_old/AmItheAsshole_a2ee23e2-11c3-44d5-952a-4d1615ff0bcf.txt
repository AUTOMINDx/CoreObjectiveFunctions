It sounds like you have a lot of history with your sister and that she has been difficult to care for over the years. Your family seems to be under the impression that you love her dearly, but you have expressed that you don't really like her. It seems like having her as a guest at your wedding will be difficult and stressful for you. You are considering not inviting her as your bridesmaid because you don't want her disrupting your day. Your mom and brothers are opposed to this idea and think it will be damaging for your sister.
