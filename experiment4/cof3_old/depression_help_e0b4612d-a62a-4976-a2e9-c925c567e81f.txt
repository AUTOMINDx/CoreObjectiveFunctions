It can be difficult to share your anxieties with others, especially if you feel like they may not be receptive or understanding. It sounds like you have taken steps to try and manage your anxieties in a healthy way, by venting to those you trust. However, it appears that this has had the opposite effect and instead of feeling supported, you now feel like you are annoying those around you. This is a common fear when speaking openly about our struggles - that we will be ignored or misunderstood. It is important to remember that everyone deals with their own struggles, and just because someone doesn't have an immediate answer or solution for you, doesn't mean they don't care. Most people would rather listen and offer support than remain silent. If you find that people are not responding positively to your discussions of anxiety, it might be helpful to frame them in a different way - for example, "I'm just feeling a little down today, can I talk to you about it?"
