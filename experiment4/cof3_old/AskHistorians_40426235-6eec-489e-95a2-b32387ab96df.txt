It seems that the genocide of Native Americans is not spoken of in the same vein as the Jewish Holocaust because it did not happen in the same place or time. The genocide of Native Americans lasted for hundreds of years, while the Holocaust happened over a few years. Additionally, the number of people killed in the Holocaust was six million, while the number of people killed in the genocide of Native Americans is estimated to be around 75 million.
