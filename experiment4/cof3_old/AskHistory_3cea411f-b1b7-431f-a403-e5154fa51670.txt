England went from the War of the Roses to a world power in just a couple centuries. It is unclear exactly how this happened, but there are a few possible explanations. One possibility is that after the Normans conquered England in 1066, they brought with them feudalism, which led to a tightly-knit aristocracy and eventually increased the power of the monarchy. Another explanation could be that England's growing wealth and power, beginning in the late medieval period and early Renaissance, allowed it to become a major player on the world stage. Finally, it is also possible that England's parliamentary system, which emerged in the 13th century, gave it an advantage over other countries.
