It is interesting that you are reading The Intelligent Investor. This book was written over 40 years ago and it is still being recommended. There may be some differences in terminology/theories/trends/statements from today that you should be aware of while reading. However, you should try to read this book in order to get the most out of it. You can compare and contrast graphs/charts of then and now, but you should also try to memorize terminology. Thanks for asking!
