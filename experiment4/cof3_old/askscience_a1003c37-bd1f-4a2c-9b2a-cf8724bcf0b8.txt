Mosaic humans do not get attacked by their own immune system because the cells with different DNA are not all actively dividing. Cells that are not actively dividing are not as likely to be recognized as foreign by the immune system. This is why transplanted organs are rejected by the immune system - because the cells in the organ are all actively dividing and will be recognized as foreign by the immune system.
