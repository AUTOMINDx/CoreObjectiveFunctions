A common talking point is the Turkish government's counterproductive course of lowering the country's key interest rate. The reasoning behind this decision is that it will stimulate economic growth. However, there is some concern that this will only worsen the country's inflation and devaluation of the Lira. Some economists argue that Turkey should follow the lead of other countries and reduce their key interest rate to 0 or even into the negative. However, others argue that Turkey should maintain its current interest rate because it is one of the few countries that has not gone into recession.
