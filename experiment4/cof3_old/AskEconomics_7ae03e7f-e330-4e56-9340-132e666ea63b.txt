It is an interesting question to consider how knowledge of Economics might change Economics itself. In some ways, it is logical that people would be influenced by what they know in their decision-making. However, it is also possible that the theory of Economics stays the same even as people apply it. There are a few factors to consider when thinking about this question. One is that there may be a lag time between when people know Economics and when they start applying it in their decisions. Another possibility is that different people may interpret Economic theory differently and so the end result may still be the same as if people did not know Economics at all. Additionally, firms and other institutions often have analysts who are not influenced by their knowledge of Economics in their decision-making. It is an interesting question to consider and one that is still being explored by economists today.
