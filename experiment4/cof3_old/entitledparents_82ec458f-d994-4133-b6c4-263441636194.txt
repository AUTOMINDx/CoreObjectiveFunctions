This Reddit user has a valid complaint about an entitled friend/parent who decided to bring their uninvited child to an adult Christmas party and take over the house. The child was walking and whatnot, and the parents had not told the hosts that they were bringing their child. As a result, the hosts had to close a bunch of doors that were intended to be left open, which made the party cramped and less fun. Additionally, the child was running around and pulling stuff out of drawers, messing with the dog, and getting into things. The parents did not seem to be very responsible in watching their child. The Reddit user ends by saying that he is not mad at the child, but he is mad at the parents. He wonders why people are judgmental towards him for complaining on the internet.
