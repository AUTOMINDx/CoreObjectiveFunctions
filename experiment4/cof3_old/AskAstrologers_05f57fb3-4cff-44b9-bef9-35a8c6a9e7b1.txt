It is important to remember that astrology is complex and should not be used to make assumptions about people. Each individual is unique and no one sign or placement can be generalized. Additionally, horoscopes in popular media are often simplified and should not be taken as gospel. Astrology can provide insight into someone's personality and what may happen in their life, but it should not be used to make decisions about someone else.
