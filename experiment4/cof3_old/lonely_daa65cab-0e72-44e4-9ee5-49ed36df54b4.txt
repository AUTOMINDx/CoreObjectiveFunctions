It can be difficult to make friends when you don't have a history, and it can be especially difficult to make friends if you don't have a loving family. It's possible that the friends you've tried to make turned out to see you as a fifth wheel or that they just plain didn't like you. If you feel completely alien to this world, and if you have an ache in your chest that is apparent, it is possible that you are not well.
