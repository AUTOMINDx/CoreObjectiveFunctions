The first mistake people often make when interpreting the astrological houses is misunderstanding their symbolic meaning. People may think that an empty 2nd house means they will never have money, when in reality it means they are not very materialistic. The second mistake is thinking that the 12 houses are simple concepts that can be easily summarized. This is not the case, as the astrological houses correspond to complex psychological concepts. It is important to understand the symbolism of each house in order to correctly interpret a natal chart.
