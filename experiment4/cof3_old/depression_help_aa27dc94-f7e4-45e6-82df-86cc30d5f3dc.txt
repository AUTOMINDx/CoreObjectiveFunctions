The Reddit user describes the challenges of being married to someone who is autistic. The user says that the spouse understands why the marriage ended and that the autistic person deserves to be alone. This paints a very bleak picture and leaves many questions unanswered. Some possible gaps in understanding include: - What specifically is causing difficulties in the marriage? - How did breaking down earlier today lead to the wife and roommate moving out? - What will the autistic person do now that they are alone?
