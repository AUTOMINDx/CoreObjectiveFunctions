Labour flexibility and economic growth are two important factors that can affect a country's economy. However, it can be difficult to measure the relationship between the two. There are a number of studies that have been conducted on this topic, but the results are inconclusive. Some research shows that labour flexibility does promote economic growth, while other research indicates that there is no measurable elasticity between the two. Overall, it seems that there is no clear consensus on whether or not labour flexibility promotes economic growth. Further research is needed in order to gain a better understanding of this relationship.
