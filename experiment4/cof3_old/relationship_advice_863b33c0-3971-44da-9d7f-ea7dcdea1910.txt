The Reddit user is asking how to respond to a situation where a guy bought her lunch, and then afterwards expected sex. This can be a difficult situation because the user may feel like they owe the man sex because he bought them lunch. It is important to remember that this is not a date, and the man did not ask the user out. The user should respond by saying that they are uncomfortable and need time. If the man asks for dinner, the user can say that they would like to have dinner but that they will not be having sex with him.
