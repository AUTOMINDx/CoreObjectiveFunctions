It is possible for a H or H- atom to end up traveling with the beam of protons at a cyclotron, although it is not likely. This is because the H or H- atom has a neutral charge and will not bend in the same way as the protons through the magnets. It is possible for an atom's momentum to carry it along with the beam of protons, but this is not likely either. The atom would need to have a very high momentum in order to make it through the magnets and into the beam pipe. If you have any other questions about this topic, please do not hesitate to ask.
