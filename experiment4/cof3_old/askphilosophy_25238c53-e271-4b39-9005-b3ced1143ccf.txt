Philosophy can be a fascinating way to interpret everything, but there is a dark side. Well. I think there is a dark side. I watched a you tube video this evening (Jordan Peterson: The Fatal Flaw in American Leftist Politics | Big Think). My lizard brain had a….negative reaction to a lot of the conclusions being formed throughout the video. He name checked a bunch of philosophies, then sort of “yadda yadda yaddas” through a balanced interpretation. I THINK that’s what happened. But I am not sophisticated enough at present to deconstruct WHY I had a negative reaction. I mean aside from the variety of hot pieces and my opinion of the people he keeps company with; but that doesn’t feel like a valid reason to dismiss his perspective? So….how do I arm myself against fallacious interpretations? (If my example above is actually fallacious). Is it just I need more exposure
