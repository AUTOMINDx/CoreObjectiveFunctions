It appears that you miss your therapist and find solace in the therapy sessions. This is understandable as therapy provides a unique space for vulnerabilities and emotional expression. It also sounds like you lack a support system outside of work. This may be contributing to the intense feelings of missing your therapist. Only seeing your therapist a few times a month may also be a contributing factor. In 11 days, that is a significant amount of time without support. You might want to look into finding support systems in your community or online. Alternatively, consider trying to contact your therapist between sessions to discuss any concerns or issues you are facing between appointments.
