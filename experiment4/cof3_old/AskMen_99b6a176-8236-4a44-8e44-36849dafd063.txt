Upon reading the posts, it seems that the user's partner got lip injections and is unhappy with how they look. One concern the user has is that the partner's lips look "comically big", and that this was due to swelling from the injections. It is possible that this is true, as her lips do look bruised. However, due to the size of her lips, he is "completely turned off". This reaction is odd, as the user admits that their partner's lips were already "pretty nice". It seems like there may be other things about the partner's appearance that are causing concern for the user. For example, they mention that their partner has been dressing in a way that they don't like and has been getting fake plastic nails. The user ends by asking others what they think about lip injections, and if they think he is out of line for being turned off by them.
