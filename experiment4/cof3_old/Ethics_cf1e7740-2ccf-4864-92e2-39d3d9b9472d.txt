The user is asking if it is unethical to use steroids if youâ€™re not using it for any sports or competition. Body dysmorphia has gone up recently, and a lot of people are using steroids to improve their shape. Not a lot of people are aware just how many are using steroids, and they might be using it for just the looks. The user wonders if it is then unethical to use it, and if it matters how much you are putting yourself out there to be seen in terms of ethics. They also ask about the potential health impacts toll on the health care system, but purely from a perspective of body expectations. You could say the same about the kind of cosmetic surgery that improve your looks or make you look younger than the rest.
