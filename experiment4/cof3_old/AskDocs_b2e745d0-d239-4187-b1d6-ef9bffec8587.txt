Based on the information in the post, it is difficult to determine what the reddish spot on the grandson's face may be. It is possible that it could be a type of rash, but without further information it is hard to say for certain. If the spot has been growing in size or if the grandson experiences any pain or irritation from it, then it would be best to have him seen by a doctor.
