It's difficult to estimate the temperature of an arc discharge in air generated through high-frequency AC, as it depends on many factors. Some things that could affect the temperature include the frequency of the AC, the distance between the electrodes, and the type of gas in the air. However, research has shown that the electron temperature is a good indicator of the plasma's overall temperature.
