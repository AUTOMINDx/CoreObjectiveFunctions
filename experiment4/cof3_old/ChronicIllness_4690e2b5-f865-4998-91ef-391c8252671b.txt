It sounds like you are feeling invalidated and uncomfortable by your friends' TikToks about chronic illness. It's important to remember that just because someone has a similar experience to you, doesn't mean they understand your experience in the same way. Disability is a complex and diverse experience, so it is likely that your friends are only trying to be humorous in their videos, without realizing how it affects you. If you feel safe and comfortable doing so, it might be helpful to talk to your friends about why the videos make you feel bad. Try framing it as a question rather than accusing them of being ableorist. For example, "I saw your TikTok and it made me feel really uncomfortable. I'm curious about why you found it funny?" This will give them an opportunity to reflect on their video and why it might have been harmful. Hopefully, this will lead to more productive dialogue and understanding between you and your friends.
