It is widely accepted that Marvel's Loki TV series has generated a backlash from viewers. Some say this is due to the liberal portrayal of women, who are not afraid to put Loki down or beat him up. However, it is important to note that the show has also received a good deal of backlash in other ways. The director of the show was abused on social media, and the lead writer has been indirectly threatened with murder. Additionally, the show lost over half a million viewers in its first season. It is difficult to determine if there is a correlation between these events, but it seems likely that there is some connection.
