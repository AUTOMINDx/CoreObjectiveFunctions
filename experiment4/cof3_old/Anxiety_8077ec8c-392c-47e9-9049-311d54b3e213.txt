It seems like Christmas can be a difficult time for some people. For Reddit user, they find themselves needing to take muscle relaxers in order to get through dinner with family. This makes them feel pathetic and increases feelings of anxiety and hopelessness. It is important to remember that we are all different and don't always deal with things in the same way. For some, being around family during the holidays can be difficult. It is important to be understanding and supportive. Merry Christmas!
