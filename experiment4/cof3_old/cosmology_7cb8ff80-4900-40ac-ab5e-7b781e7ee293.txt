Inflation is a period of rapid expansion that occurred in the earliest moments of the universe. It is thought to have been caused by a mysterious force called dark energy. During inflation, quark pairs would have been separated rapidly and powerfully from one another. When quarks separate a certain distance, the energy it takes to separate them is enough to generate a new quark pair. Inflation would have generated many quark pairs by forcing separation of quarks. However, inflation does not add energy to the system when it separates the quarks in the same way that dark energy isn't applying a force accelerating galaxies away from us, but is merely an expansion of the space between them.
