Dudes of Reddit, according to some research, men are less likely to express their emotions than women. It's possible that you may feel like you're not supposed to cry or that it's a sign of weakness. However, crying is a natural human response to sadness, hurt, anger, or other intense emotions. It can be really beneficial to let those emotions out and talk about them with somebody else. You're not alone in feeling this way -men all around the world experience the same range of emotions. If you're going through a tough time, know that there are people who care about you and are here to help. You're also welcome to talk to me anytime.
