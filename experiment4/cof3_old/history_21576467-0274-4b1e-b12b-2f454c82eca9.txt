This thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post. So if you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask, today is your lucky day! Ask away and our regular rules and guidelines still apply. Just to be extra clear: Questions need to be historical in nature, and silly does not mean that your question should be a joke.
