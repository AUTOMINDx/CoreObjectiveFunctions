Reddit user says: blade Runner I feel like I’m a replicant. Since I don’t really seem to have a true sense of a core personality (other than like pure negativity and a downer of a position), often I catch myself emulating the traits of other people, to a tee. It’s like I catch them in myself. This sounds like an interesting experience. It is normal to imitate the behaviors of the people around us, as we are influenced by them. However, it sounds like you may be identifying with this behavior more than usual. This could be because you feel like you do not have a strong sense of self, or identity. If this is the case, you may want to explore this further with a therapist or counselor.
