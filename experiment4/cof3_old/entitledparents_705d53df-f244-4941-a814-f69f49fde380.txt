The Reddit user's father didn't allow them to have fun on their sister's birthday. The User's sister learned her lesson and played games that paid out tickets the most so she could get something good. The User scored big on a game and their sister saw this and ran away. Their father came out of nowhere and asked what was going on. Evil Mamabear said the User was rubbing their success in their sister's face. The User's father said they were following them around because he knew they would try to find a way to blame the User. The User's father said the User did nothing wrong and Evil Mamabear couldn't make them wrong.
