This Reddit user is a professional resume writer and career consultant who is offering to rewrite job descriptions for free in this thread to those who are seeking help. They have been serving the Reddit community diligently for the last two years and were successful in getting their own career started after hosting an AMA on Reddit that made it to the front page. They are grateful for everything Reddit has done for them and try to pay forward their gratitude whenever they can. Last year on Christmas Eve, they hosted a thread where they offered to rewrite segments of Redditors' resumes pro-bono. They are caught up on work for the first time in ages and want to give back by doing the same thing this year. If anyone sees this thread and wants components of their resumes rewritten professionally, they can copy and paste segments of their resumes into this thread and the Reddit user will respond by rewriting them in an actionized format.
