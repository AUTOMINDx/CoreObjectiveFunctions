It sounds like the author of this post did not have a positive experience with trauma. It is understandable that reading about how those hard days are necessary for growth may be upsetting. Trauma can be extremely difficult and it is not something that most people choose to go through. However, it is possible to find growth in the midst of adversity. For some people, trauma leads to great personal growth. It can teach them about themselves, help them develop empathy for others, and make them stronger than they ever thought possible. It is not right or fair for everyone, but it is a possibility. There is no one right way to respond to trauma and there is no wrong way to grow from it.
