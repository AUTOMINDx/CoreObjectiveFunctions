There is some debate over whether Trotsky actually worked with fascists against the Soviet Union. Some people claim that Stalin's purges were in response to Trotsky's supposed treason, while others argue that Trotsky posed no threat to Stalin's power. What is clear, however, is that Stalin's purges were devastating to the Communist Party and led to thousands of deaths. Thanks for asking!
