It is difficult to say whether companies are hiring at this time of year, as it varies depending on the industry and the company. Some companies may be more likely to hire at this time than others. However, it is generally a good idea to stay proactive in your job search and keep applying for positions even if it seems like the market is competitive. It is also important to keep in mind that companies often have different hiring timelines, so don't be discouraged if you don't hear back from a company right away. In terms of cheering up, it can be helpful to do things that make you happy or help you relax. Some people find that spending time with friends and family can help, while others enjoy taking walks or listening to music. Whatever makes you feel better is worth trying!
