Afroasiatic languages are thought to have spread into North Africa and the Sahel region in the early Bronze Age. The development of early Berber and Chadic languages is still being studied, but it is thought that they may be related to the Capsian culture. It is also believed that there may be a genetic component associated with these languages, although more research is needed to confirm this.
