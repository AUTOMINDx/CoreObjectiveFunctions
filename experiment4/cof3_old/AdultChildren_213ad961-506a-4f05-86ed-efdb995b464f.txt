It sounds like you've been through a lot, and I'm sorry to hear that. I want to commend you for telling someone about your struggles - it can be very difficult to do that, especially if you've been taught not to trust them. It sounds like your family members are not the problem - your dad is. His drinking has caused a lot of pain and isolation for you, and it's great that you've realized that. You have made a very brave choice today in telling someone about your situation, and I hope it makes things a little bit easier for you.
