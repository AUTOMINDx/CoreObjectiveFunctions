In this situation, the Reddit user is upset because her fiancé wants to name the baby after himself. The user feels that it's unfair that her fiancé gets to name the baby after himself and that her family gets excluded. After discussing the issue with her fiancé, they came to an agreement where the boy baby will have his father's middle name and the girl baby will have her sister's middle name. They also decided that for the first names of their children, they will use a different variation of their family members' names.
