It sounds like you are feeling a lot of anger and resentment towards the people who have hurt you in your life. It's understandable to feel this way, but it's important to remember that these people are not perfect. They have hurt you, but that doesn't mean they are bad people - they may have made some bad choices, or may have been dealing with their own struggles at the time. It's important to try to understand why they did the things they did, even if you don't agree with them. This will help you forgive them, which can be very healing.
