There are a number of fictional cities that are based on real-life counterparts. In Lord of the Rings, Gondolin is based on Petra, and Braavos in Game of Thrones is based on Venice. However, these hidden cities were not actually hidden in their respective works â€“ they were revealed to the characters and readers gradually over time. The concept of a hidden city may have originated with the legend of Atlantis. Plato spoke about this mysterious city, which was said to be located in the Atlantic Ocean. Some believe that Atlantis was based on the real-life city of Helike, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 373 BC.
