It seems that in order to garner legitimacy, proponents of certain philosophies attempt to tie the maxims of their movements with seemingly natural human societal processes. For example, using trade and private/personal property in pre-modern/historic societies (Rome, Egypt, Songhai, Tuareg, Malawi are among some names I've personally heard mentioned) to validate capitalism, or inversely, communal ownership of the means of production in agricultural/pastoral/hunter-gatherer economies to validate socialism. Proponents of these philosophies believe that by understanding how these societies operated, they can better understand the validity of their philosophies. However, it is important to remember that these societies were not perfect, and that there are many complexities which cannot be captured by comparing them to modern societies.
