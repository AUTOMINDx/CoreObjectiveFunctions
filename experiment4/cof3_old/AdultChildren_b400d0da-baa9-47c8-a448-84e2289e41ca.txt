It sounds like you didn't find the right group for you, or maybe you didn't connect with the other members of the group. It can be difficult to share personal information, especially when it comes to traumatic experiences. It sounds like the people in the groups you tried were not very supportive or understanding. It's important to find a group of people who will listen and empathize with what you're going through. There are many different groups out there that can offer support, so it might be helpful to do some research and try a few different ones until you find one that feels right for you.
