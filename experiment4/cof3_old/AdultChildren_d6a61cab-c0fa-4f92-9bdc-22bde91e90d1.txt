I want to say thank you to everyone in this subreddit for sharing their stories. It's tough during the holiday season, and it's good to know that we're not alone. I also want to encourage anyone who is struggling to take some time for themselves. If you need to, remove yourself from any uncomfortable situation. Remember that it's just another day, and don't put too much pressure on yourself.
