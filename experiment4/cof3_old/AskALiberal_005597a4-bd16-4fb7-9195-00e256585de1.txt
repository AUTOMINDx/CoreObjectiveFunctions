It seems that some people on the right are blaming Buttigieg for a deadly truck crash. However, he is not actually responsible for the licensing requirements, which are issued by states, not the federal government. It's worth noting that Buttigieg only became Secretary of Transportation in February 2021, after the crash occurred. So it's unclear why people are blaming him specifically for something that happened before he was even in office.
