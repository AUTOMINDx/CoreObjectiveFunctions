It sounds like you have a difficult situation on your hands. It's understandable to feel upset when your mother-in-law tries to take over Christmas by buying the same gift as you. Your husband seems to be supportive and understands the situation. It might be helpful to talk to him about your feelings and come up with a plan together. You could also try talking to your mother-in-law again and explain how you feel. It's possible that she didn't mean to cause any conflict and would be willing to work something out.
