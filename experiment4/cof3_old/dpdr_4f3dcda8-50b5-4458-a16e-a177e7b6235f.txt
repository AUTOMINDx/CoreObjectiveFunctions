People who experience derealization may find it difficult to maintain a natural disposition in social situations. This can be daunting, especially when interacting with strangers or customer service representatives. Some advice on how to manage this anxiety and panic is to focus on the conversation, rather than the person you are talking to. Another suggestion is to practice grounding techniques such as deep breathing or focusing on your surroundings.
