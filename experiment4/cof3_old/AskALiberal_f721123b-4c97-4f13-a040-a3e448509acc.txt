It can be difficult to negotiate or compromise with someone who feels that any agreement reached will be unacceptable in the future. However, it is important to remember that people can and do change their minds, and hopefully the other person will be willing to reconsider compromise as a possibility in the future. In the meantime, it may be helpful to try and understand the other person's reasoning and perspective, even if you don't agree with them. This can help to build a foundation for future negotiations.
