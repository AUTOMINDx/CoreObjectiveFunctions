There are a few ways we know that the universe is expanding. One of these ways is through looking at distant galaxies and seeing that they are red shifted. This is because as the universe expands, the light from these galaxies loses energy, which causes it to shift to the red end of the spectrum. However, there are other potential explanations for why we see these galaxies as red shifted, such as light losing energy over time due to the distance travelled or some other unknown reason. Additionally, there are other forms of evidence that support the idea of an expanding universe, such as cosmic microwave background radiation.
