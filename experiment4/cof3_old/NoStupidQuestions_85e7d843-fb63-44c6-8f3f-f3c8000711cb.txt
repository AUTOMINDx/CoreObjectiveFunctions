The United States government places a great importance on its military, and at the same time allows a high percentage of its veteran population to be homeless. This may appear to be contradictory, but there are several factors that contribute to this situation. One reason is that many veterans do not qualify for benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This can be due to a number of factors, such as having an income that is too high or being discharged for misconduct. Another reason is that the VA does not have enough funding to provide all of the services that it would like to offer. This has led to long waiting lists for services such as mental health care or housing assistance. Finally, it can be difficult for veterans to find civilian employment after leaving the military. This is especially true during times of high unemployment, such as we are currently experiencing.
