It can be difficult to know how to handle being misgendered as a transgender person. It's especially difficult when you are a first-year PhD student or early in your career. In this case, it might be better to crosspost or submit elsewhere instead of here on Reddit. You have chosen to not say anything to the professors who have misgendered you, but you feel like this is an untenable situation. You want to assert your identity as a transgender person, but you also don't want to risk retaliation or damage relationships with your cohort or mentors. There is no one perfect solution to this problem, but there are things you can do to make it easier. You can talk to your friends and cohorts about what has been happening and ask them for help. You can also reach out to an LGBTQ+ advocacy group for more resources and support.
