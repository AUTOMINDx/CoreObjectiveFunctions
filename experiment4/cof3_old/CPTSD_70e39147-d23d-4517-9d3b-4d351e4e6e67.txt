It is possible that the poster's therapist was not responding well to the poster emphasizing the positive aspects of their father because the therapist was only focused on the abuse that was inflicted by the father. It is possible that the therapist was concerned about the poster remaining attached to a harmful relationship. However, it is also possible that, after some time, the poster realized that they needed to focus on self-love in order to move past the emotional pain they were experiencing. The poster describes how they met wonderful people who helped them through a difficult time and how, by spending time with one particular person, they realized what they had been missing in their life. The poster's mother was cold and lacked emotions, which probably caused her to unknowingly hate her own child.
