It is difficult to say whether or not the US could produce 300,000 planes for military use again. This number is based on the number of planes produced during WW2, and it is possible that the planes produced during this time were more simple and less expensive than the modern jet planes used today. Additionally, the situation in which these planes would be used may be different than in WW2. In a hypothetical war with China, for example, each nation might battle for air superiority over a particular region. If the US were to lose 100 F-35 jets and 2 of their expensive stealth bombers, they would need to produce more than enough replacements to make up for these losses.
