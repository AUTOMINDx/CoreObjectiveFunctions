It sounds like you are feeling overworked and underpaid. It's understandable to feel this way, especially given that you've been working so hard in your role. I want to offer some advice on how to handle the situation. Firstly, it's important to understand that your employer may be unwilling to give you a raise due to budget constraints or other factors. However, it is worth trying to negotiate for a raise. You could try framing it as an ultimatum - asking for a raise or resigning. This may be more effective than simply asking for a raise outright. If your employer denies your request for a raise, it may be time to consider looking for another job. In this case, it is important to maintain a professional relationship with your current employer. Burning bridges with your old employer could negatively impact your future job prospects.
