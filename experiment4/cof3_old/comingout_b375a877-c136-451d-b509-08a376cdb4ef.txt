It can be difficult to adjust to the different way you are treated after coming out as LGBTQ+. Some people may suddenly seem distant or forgetful, as if they are no longer interested in being friends with you. This can be hurtful, but it is important to remember that these people may not have fully understood what it means to be LGBTQ+ and may need some time to adjust. You can reach out to them and provide information or resources that could help them understand better. It is also worth considering whether or not you want to maintain relationships with people who cannot accept you for who you are. There are many supportive and accepting people in the world, so do not feel like you have to stay in relationships that make you feel uncomfortable or unsupported.
