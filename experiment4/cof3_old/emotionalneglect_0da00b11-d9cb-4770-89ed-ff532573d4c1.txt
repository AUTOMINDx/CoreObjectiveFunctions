It sounds like you feel very sad when parted from friends, and that you don't want to invest in relationships because you know they will end soon. This may be due to an attachment style issue, where you have a fear of loss or abandonment. It's natural to feel this way, but there are ways to work on this issue so that you can enjoy relationships more fully. You could talk to a therapist about your attachment style and how to work on it. There are also many self-help books on the topic. Friends can also be a support system for you, and help you through tough times. Keep in mind that not all friendships last forever, but that doesn't mean they weren't meaningful or valuable.
