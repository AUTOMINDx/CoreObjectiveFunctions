According to current cosmological theory, the Big Bang was not a single event but rather the expansion of space itself. This means that the universe was expanding even before matter began to spread out into it. So why was the early universe hot? One possible explanation is that the high density of the universe caused it to be hot. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is evidence that the early universe was hot, and scientists are still working to better understand this phenomenon.
