Reddit user says: Are PiPs just an excuse to fire? [NY] It is difficult to say based on the limited information provided. It is possible that the individual's supervisors are pressuring them to meet quota despite their illness, or that the company is using the PiP as a way to terminate the individual's employment without having to undergo a formal firing process. However, it is also possible that the individual's supervisors are genuinely interested in helping them recover and improve their performance. Without knowing more, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about the situation. However, it is important to be aware of one's legal rights in case of termination, and to document all interactions with supervisors and company officials.
