It seems that there is some disagreement over Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil" thesis. Some people believe that her analysis was flawed, while others think that her thesis has gained more traction in recent decades. I find it peculiar how she mentions that Eichmann did not think of his actions as evil, as he could not view his actions from the viewpoint of his victims. This suggests to me that he may have been a sociopath, which would make him very much not normal.
