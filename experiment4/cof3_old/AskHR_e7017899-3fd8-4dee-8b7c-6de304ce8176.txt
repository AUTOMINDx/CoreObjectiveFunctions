From what I can understand, you have been working a lot recently because your manager is on Covid leave. Your manager called out from work on November 13th because his son had tested positive for Covid and was supposed to return to work on December 21st. However, your manager did not return to work on December 21st and the Area Manager has been having you work stores by yourself. You are concerned about your manager and want to know when he is going to return to work. You have not received any communication from your manager since November 17th. Would it be appropriate for you to go to HR and file a complaint?
