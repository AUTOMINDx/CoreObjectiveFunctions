It appears that the Democrats may have crossed the toughest hurdle already, with their surprisingly good performance in redistricting. Gerrymandering has traditionally been seen as a big advantage for Republicans, but the new analysis suggests that this may not be the case this time around. This is good news for the Democrats, who were feared to face a bloodbath in the upcoming elections. However, despite this good news, the Democrats do not seem confident about their chances - 23 incumbents have already retired from the House, more than in any other election cycle. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to break the midterm curse.
