Genetic mosaicism is a condition that occurs when a person has two or more genetically different cells in their body. There are three types of genetic mosaicism: somatic, gonadal, and chimerism. Somatic mosaicism occurs when different cells in the body have different genetic information. Gonadal mosaicism occurs when different cells in the ovaries or testes have different genetic information. Chimerism occurs when a person has two genetically different sets of DNA in their body, one from each parent. Chimerism can occur from a fertilized egg that splits into two embryos, or from a transplant of tissue from one person to another. The symptoms of genetic mosaicism vary depending on the type of mosaicism. Somatic mosaicism usually does not cause any symptoms. Gonadal mosaicism can cause infertility or abnormal sexual development. Chimerism can cause problems with the immune system if one set of DNA is not recognized as being part of the person's body.The immune system can recognize genetic mosaic tissue as being different from the rest of the person's body. This is why transplanted organs are rejected, but not genetic mosaic tissue.
