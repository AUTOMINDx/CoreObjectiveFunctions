How to respond to a friend who expects sex after buying you lunch: It can be tricky to know how to handle a situation when a friend expects something in return for a gesture like buying you lunch. In some cases, it may be appropriate to simply thank them and decline their offer. However, if you feel like you may be uncomfortable or pressured into having sex with your friend, it is important to communicate this directly. You can say something like, "I really appreciate your offer, but I'm not interested in having sex with you." If your friend continues pressuring you or becomes verbally abusive, it is best to end the conversation and/or remove yourself from the situation. It is also important to keep in mind that sexual harassment is never okay, no matter who is doing it. If someone makes unwanted advances towards you, or tries to touch you sexually without consent, it is important to speak up and tell them firmly that this behavior is not acceptable. You can say something like,"I don't want you to touch me like that without my consent." or "That's not OK, stop it."
