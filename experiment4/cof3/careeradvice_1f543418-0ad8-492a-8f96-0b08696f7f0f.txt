At most companies, the HR salary adjustment policy dictates how salaries are changed and adjusted annually. This policy can vary from company to company, but typically there is a set formula or range that determines how salary adjustments are made. Typically, increases are based on either merit (achievement) or cost of living adjustments. Some companies also offer bonuses or other forms of incentive pay in order to attract or retain top talent. If you are curious about what others are making in your role at your company, you can ask your colleagues or search websites like Glassdoor.com which publish anonymous data on salaries. If you're looking to negotiate your salary, it is important to do your research and come prepared with specific examples of how you have added value to your team or company. You should also be aware of the market value for your skills and experience. If you lied about your salary on a job application and have been offered the job, you will likely need to come clean and revealWhat do you mean by "lied about your salary"?
