There is no one "right" way to deal with a parent who drinks, as each situation is unique. However, there are some general tips that may be useful. First, it is important to remember that you cannot change your parent's behavior, and attempting to do so will only lead to frustration on your part. It is also important to maintain healthy boundaries with an alcoholic parent. Establishing and enforcing boundaries can be difficult, but it is important to remember that you are not responsible for your parent's drinking and you cannot fix their problems. If you are able to, it may be helpful to talk to other family members or friends about what you are going through, as they may be able to offer support. Finally, if you feel unsafe or like your parent's drinking is causing harm to yourself or others, it may be necessary to seek professional help. If you are dealing with a gaslighting parent, the key thing to remember is that their behavior is not your faultIf your parent is engaging in gaslighting behavior, they may be trying to manipulate you into thinking that their behavior is normal or that you are the one who is at fault. This can be extremely confusing and emotionally draining, but it is important to remember that their behavior is not your fault. You do not deserve to be manipulated and for someone to try and control how you feel is wrong. Family members and friends can be a great support system during this time, and seeking professional help may also be beneficial.
