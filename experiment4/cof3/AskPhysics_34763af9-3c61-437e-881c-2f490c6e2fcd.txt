The Hartree-Fock model is a quantum chemical model that describes the structure and energy of isolated molecules using the principles of quantum mechanics. The Hartree-Fock model was developed by Douglas Hartree and John Lennard-Jones in the 1950s, and is based on the multi-electron description models proposed by Walter Heitler and Fritz London in 1927. The Hartree-Fock model is a self-consistent method that calculates the wavefunction of a molecule, as well as the energies of its constituent atoms and electrons. The Hartree-Fock model can be used to calculate the molecular geometry, vibrational frequencies, and electronic transition energies of molecules. The model also accounts for electron spin and allows for the prediction of isotope effects. However, the Hartree-Fock model is limited in its ability to predict reactivity, and does not take into account the effects of connection between molecules (bonding).
