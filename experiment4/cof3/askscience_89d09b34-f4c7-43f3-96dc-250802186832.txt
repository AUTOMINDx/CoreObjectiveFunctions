An arc furnace is a type of furnace that uses electricity to create a sustained arc between two electrodes. This arc creates intense heat, which is used to melt and fuse metals. The heat generated by the arc can reach temperatures of up to 10,000 degrees Celsius, making it an extremely effective means of melting and fusing metals. One type of arc furnace that is especially popular for melting and fusing metals is the electric arc furnace. In this furnace, the electrodes are made of carbon, and the arc is created by passing an electric current through them. This type of furnace can reach temperatures of up to 5000 degrees Celsius, making it a very effective means of melting and fusing metals. Another type of arc furnace that is commonly used for melting and fusing metals is the plasma arc furnace. In this furnace, the electrodes are made of tungsten, and the arc is created by passing a gas (typically hydrogen) through them. This type of furnace can reachThe arc furnace can reach temperatures of up to 10,000 degrees Celsius.
