Online, she has been discussed on Reddit posts about the Mensrights subreddit, where some posters have criticised her for speaking out about her experience.One Reddit post in particular criticised Sebold for 'shaming' men and said that she was exploiting her experience for personal gain.

Sebold has responded to the online criticism, saying that she doesn't hate men and that her book was about healing, not hatred.
