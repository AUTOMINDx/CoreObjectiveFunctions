The upcoming Loki series on the Disney+ streaming service has generated a great deal of interest and speculation, due in part to the popularity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films featuring the character. One particular source of curiosity is the fact that the series will be led by a male actor, with all female characters in supporting roles. Some have expressed concerns that this may lead to a liberal portrayal of women, with predictable backlash from certain corners. However, Kevin Feige and other Marvel show runners have hinted that there may be more to these characters than meets the eye. Season 2 has already been ordered, so we will soon see just how well these women are written and portrayed.Some of the female characters who will appear in Loki include his mother Frigga, played by Jessica Hecht, and his adopted sister Hela, played by Claudia Kim.
