There are a few different ways that you can learn ICs. One way is to attend an IC school, such as the Naval Cryptologic School (NCS) in Pensacola, Florida, or the Defense Language Institute (DLI) in Monterey, California. You can also find IC courses and materials from private companies, such as The SANS Institute, which offers a variety of information security courses, including an introductory course on ICs. ICs are computer programs or systems that perform specific information security functions. There are many different types of ICs, and each has a unique function or set of functions. For example, some common ICs include intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, and anti-virus programs. To identify an IC, you first need to understand its function. Once you know the function of an IC, you can look for identifiers that will help you identify it. Most ICs have unique filenames, logosSome common filenames that are associated with ICs include: ids.exe, firewall.exe, and av.exe. Many ICs also have unique logos that can help you identify them. For example, the logo for Symantec's Norton Anti-Virus is a red shield with a white S in the middle.
