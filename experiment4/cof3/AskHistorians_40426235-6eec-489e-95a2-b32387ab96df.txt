There are a number of reasons why the genocide of Native Americans is not spoken of in the same vein as the Holocaust. First, Columbus' arrival in 1492 began a period of intentional violence and slaughter against indigenous people that would continue for centuries. This systematic extermination was dubbed the "American Holocaust" by historian D.E. Stannard. It's also worth noting that the population of Native Americans was much larger than that of European Jews, so the death toll is significantly higher. Finally, there has been a long history of erasure and discrimination against Native Americans, which means their experiences are often left out of the historical record.One example of this erasure is the fact that Christopher Columbus, who is often credited with discovering America, was actually responsible for initiating the genocide of Native Americans. Columbus and his crew arrived in the New World in 1492 and began slaughtering the indigenous people they encountered. Over the next few centuries, millions of Native Americans were killed as a result of European colonization and conquest.
