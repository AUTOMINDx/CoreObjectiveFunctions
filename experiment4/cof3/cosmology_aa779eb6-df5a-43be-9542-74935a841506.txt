There are a number of ways that scientists know that the universe is expanding. One way is through the red shift in galaxies. The further away a galaxy is from us, the more the light waves from that galaxy are stretched out, or shifted to the red end of the spectrum. This is because as the universe expands, the space between galaxies stretches, which causes the light waves to lose energy. Additionally, scientists have been able to measure the expansion of the universe by studying how it distorts light from distant galaxies. And finally, another proof of expansion is the way that temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation are distributed. These fluctuations are thought to be caused by density fluctuations in the early universe, and scientists have found that they are statistically isotropic, meaning they are evenly spread out in all directions. This only makes sense if the universe is expanding. There are also ways to experimentally test whether or not the universe is expanding. One such way is through looking at TypeOne way to experimentally test the expansion of the universe is by looking at Type Ia supernovae. These are supernovae that all have the same brightness, which makes them useful for measuring distances. By studying how their brightness changes over time, scientists can determine how quickly the universe is expanding.
