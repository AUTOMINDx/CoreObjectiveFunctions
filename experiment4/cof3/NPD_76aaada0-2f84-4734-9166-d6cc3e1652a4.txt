Pathological narcissism is a mental disorder that is characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, excessive need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. People with pathological narcissism often have difficulty regulating their self-esteem, which can lead to impulsive and destructive behavior. Recovery from pathological narcissism can be difficult, but it is possible with the help of a therapist or support group. The most important thing for someone with narcissistic tendencies is to learn how to be healthy and happy without relying on external validation. This may include learning how to give and receive constructive criticism, setting realistic goals, and developing meaningful relationships.Pathological narcissism is a mental disorder that is typically characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a chronic need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others.
