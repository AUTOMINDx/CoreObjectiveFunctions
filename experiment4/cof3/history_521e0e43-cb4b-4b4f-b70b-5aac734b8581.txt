According to the article "What Do Generals Think About Their Bad Decisions?" by Dominic Tierney, generals throughout history have typically felt guilty about their bad decision making. For example, General William Westmoreland was plagued by guilt after the Vietnam War, and he even wrote a letter to then-President Richard Nixon stating, "We failed to achieve our objectives" and "We did not win the war." General Douglas MacArthur also felt guilty after the Korean War, admitting that he should have "gone all out at the beginning" and that he had been "overcautious." In contrast to serial killers, who typically feel no remorse for their victims, generals often feel tremendous guilt over casualties in battle. For example, after the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee wrote a letter to Confederate President Jefferson Davis in which he said, "I fear I have done wrong." And after the Battle of 73 Easting during the Persian Gulf WarWhat are some examples of guilt that generals have expressed after a battle?
