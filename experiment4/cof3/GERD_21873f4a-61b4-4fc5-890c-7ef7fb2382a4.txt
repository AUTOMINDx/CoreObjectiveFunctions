There is some evidence that suggests that PPI medications may make GERD worse in some people. For example, a study published in the journal Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics in 2016 found that patients who took PPI medications for GERD were more likely to experience severe bloating and flatulence than those who did not take PPIs. Additionally, a study published in the journal Gut in 2007 found that patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who took omeprazole (a type of PPI) were more likely to develop gastritis than those who did not take omeprazole. However, it is important to note that not everyone who takes a PPI medication will experience these side effects. Additionally, there are other treatments available for GERD and gastritis besides PPIs, such as head on a wedge pillow for acid reflux or antacids for mild cases of GERD.
