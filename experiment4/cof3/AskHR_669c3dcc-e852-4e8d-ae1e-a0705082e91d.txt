If you have been fired from your job and are now unemployed, you may be wondering how to get unemployment benefits. In most cases, unemployment benefits are available to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. However, if you were fired for gross misconduct, you may be disqualified from receiving benefits. What is considered gross misconduct varies from state to state, but generally includes serious violations of workplace policies or rules. For example, firing someone for coming to work intoxicated or for stealing from the company would likely be considered gross misconduct. In addition to unemployment benefits, there are a number of social supports available in most areas that can help you while you are unemployed. These include food stamps, Medicaid, and public housing. To find out what programs are available in your area, contact your local social services agency.The definition of "gross misconduct" varies from state to state, but typically includes serious violations of workplace policies or rules.
