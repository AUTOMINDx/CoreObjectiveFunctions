The impact of human DNA on the development of life on Earth is a complex and ongoing question that scientists are still trying to answer. It is clear, however, that humans have had a significant impact on the evolution of other species. For example, the domestication of animals and crops has resulted in changes to the genetic makeup of these organisms. It is also possible that human DNA has had an even more direct impact on the development of life on Earth. Some scientists speculate that human beings were not actually descendants of apes, but were instead created through genetic engineering by an alien species. If this is true, it would mean that human beings have had a profound and unmeasured influence on the course of evolution. What would be the effect on the development of life on Earth if a human body was sent back in time 2000 million years? It's impossible to say for sure, but it's likely that the introduction of human DNA would have a significant impact on the development of life2000 million years ago is too far back If a human body was sent back in time 3000 million years, it's likely that the introduction of human DNA would have an even more significant impact on the development of life on Earth. The first forms of life on Earth are believed to have emerged around 3000 million years ago, so human DNA would be present at a time when the process of evolution was just beginning to take shape. It's difficult to know exactly how life would be different if human beings had never evolved, but it's safe to say that the development of life on Earth would be drastically different.
