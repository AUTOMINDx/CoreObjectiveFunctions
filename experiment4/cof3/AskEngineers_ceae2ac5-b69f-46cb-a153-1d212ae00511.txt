The different types of engineering include civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and chemical engineering. A typical day for a mechanical engineer might include designing new products, researching materials, and working with computer-aided design (CAD) software. The average salary for a mechanical engineer is about $85,000 per year. The math used in engineering is primarily calculus and linear algebra. CAD software helps engineers visualize how a product will look and how it will function, which can help reduce errors and speed up the design process.A typical day for a mechanical engineer might include designing new products, researching materials, and working with computer-aided design (CAD) software.
