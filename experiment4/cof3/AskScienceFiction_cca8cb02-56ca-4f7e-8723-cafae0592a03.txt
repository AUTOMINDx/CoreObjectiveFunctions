There have been numerous reports of stray projectiles from large ships hitting something or someone way down the line. In some cases, these projectiles have been identified as stray laser beams, plasma beams, or other types of energy weapons. While such accidents are rare, they can cause serious damage and even fatalities. For example, in a recent incident, a stray plasma beam fired from a naval vessel struck a commercial airline passenger jet more than 20 miles away. The jet was damaged and several people were injured. This type of accidental shooting can also happen in the media. For example, in 2010 a laser pointer being used by a TV reporter during a live broadcast hit an airplane that was flying overhead. The plane was temporarily blinded and its pilot was later quoted as saying "It was like looking into the sun."There have been numerous reports of stray projectiles from large ships hitting something or someone way down the line.
