Some actions that a CPS worker may take can lead to the death of a newborn infant. For example, if a CPS worker interviews the parents of a newborn in their home, and the home is not safe for the child, the baby may be removed from the home and placed with another family or in foster care. If the parents are not able to provide a safe and stable home for their child, it is important that the CPS worker takes steps to protect the welfare of the child. The policy on CPS worker actions that may lead to the death of a newborn infant is that workers must assess the safety of all homes before they conduct an interview with the parents. If there is any concern for the safety of the child, steps should be taken to remove the child from potential harm. The welfare of the child should always be prioritized when making decisions about their care. Ethical considerations for CPS workers include understanding their duty to protect the safety of children above all else.
