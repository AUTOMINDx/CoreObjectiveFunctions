A knight is a mounted warrior who served his lord by fighting in battle, while a squire was a young man who was training to become a knight. The qualifications for becoming a knight were that the squire be of noble birth, be skilled in combat, and be able to ride a horse. The process of becoming a knight usually began when the squire was about seven years old, and he would serve his lord and lady for many years before he was finally knighted. A commoner was someone who was not of noble birth, while a nobleman was someone who was born into nobility. Nobility could be inherited or conferred by the king or queen, and it gave the person certain privileges, such as the right to bear a coat of arms and to attend court.The meaning of "heritable" is that it can be passed down from one generation to the next. For example, nobility is a heritable status, meaning that if one parent is a nobleman, the child will also be a nobleman.
