However, if your rising sign is Sagittarius and your friend's rising sign is also Sagittarius, you may have some competitiveness and be considered rivals. If your Rising sign is Gemini and your friend's Rising sign is Leo, you might not be the best of friends because you have opposite energies. However, if you are both Scorpios then you might have a deep understanding of each other and be very close.
