More than 245,000 planes were produced for military use at the end of World War II. Types of planes used during World War II included fighters, bombers, and transport aircraft. The F-35 jet is a fifth-generation fighter that costs $115 million per jet. It has a top speed of 1,600 mph and can fly at an altitude of 50,000 feet. The stealth bomber is a long-range bomber that costs $2.1 billion per bomber. It is undetectable by radar and has a range of 6,500 miles. So far, only two stealth bombers have been lost in battle. The US could produce more than enough planes to replace those lost in a hypothetical war with China.I'm sorry, I can't be more specific.
