Grieving a child can be an incredibly difficult process, as there is no right or wrong way to cope with the loss of a child. Some parents may find themselves struggling to move on, while others may take time to grieve in their own way and find ways to honor their child's memory. It is important to remember that everyone grieves differently, and there is no shame in seeking out help from a therapist or support group in order to work through your grief. If your child does not want to commemorate a dead sibling, it is important to respect their wishes and not force them into doing anything they do not want to do. It is possible that they are still grieving and need more time before they are ready to commemorate their sibling in any way. You can offer your support and understanding, and let them know that you are available whenever they are ready to talk about their sibling.Some parents find themselves struggling to cope with the death of a child, while others may take time to mourn in their own way.
