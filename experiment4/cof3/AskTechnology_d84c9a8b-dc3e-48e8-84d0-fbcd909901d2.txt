There are several ways to protect paintings from being photographed. One way is to distort the photo so that the painting is not clearly visible. This can be done using software like Photoshop or GIMP. Another option is to place a object in front of the painting to block it from being photographed. This could be a piece of cardboard, cloth, or any other object that will obscure the painting from view. Finally, some museums and art galleries will prohibit photography altogether in order to protect the paintings from being damaged or reproduced.One way to distort a photo to protect a painting is to use software like Photoshop or GIMP.
