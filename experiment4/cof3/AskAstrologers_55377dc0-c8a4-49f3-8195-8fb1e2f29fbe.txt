There are a variety of aspects in astrology, which are each associated with different meanings. Some of the most common aspects are triangles, squares, oppositions, and conjunctions. Triangles occur when two planets are 60 degrees apart from each other. This is considered a harmonious aspect, and is often associated with creative energy and growth. Squares occur when two planets are 90 degrees apart from each other. This is considered a challenging aspect, and can often be associated with difficulties and struggles. Oppositions occur when two planets are 180 degrees apart from each other. This is considered a difficult aspect, as it can create a lot of tension and conflict. Conjunctions occur when two planets are in the same place in the sky. This is considered a very strong aspect, as the two planets are aligned in the same direction.There are a variety of aspects in astrology, which are each associated with different meanings.
