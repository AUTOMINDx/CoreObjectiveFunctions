Inertial frames of reference are frames of reference that are not affected by the relative motion between them and another frame of reference. Inertial frames of reference are often considered to be at rest or in a state of uniform motion. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object in motion. It is equal to the object's mass multiplied by the square of its velocity. Velocity is a measure of how fast an object is moving.Inertial frames of reference are frames of reference that are not affected by the relative motion between them and another frame of reference.
