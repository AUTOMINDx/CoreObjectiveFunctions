In Alex Steffen's article "The End of Travel," he discusses the many ways in which travel is changing and how those changes are impacting the world. He points out that both the sheer number of people travelling and the distance they're travelling are on the rise, and this increased demand is putting a strain on the planet. Steffen argues that we need to find new ways to travel, or else face some very serious consequences. One way of measuring the environmental impact of travel is by looking at its carbon emissions. A study cited by The Guardian found that a single round-trip flight between London and New York emits 1.6 tons of CO2, more than the average person in a developing country emits in a year. And that's just one flight! Air travel is a major contributor to climate change, accounting for around 2-3% of global emissions. There are some things we can do to reduce our air travel emissions, like flying less and choosing more sustainableFor example, one way to reduce our air travel emissions is by flying less. We can also choose more sustainable modes of transportation, like high-speed trains.
