There is no right or wrong answer to this question - it depends on your specific situation and relationship with your fiancé. Some couples might be able to negotiate a compromise wherein each person gets to name one baby, or perhaps the babies are given joint names. Other couples might find that they cannot agree on baby names, in which case the parents might choose different names for their children or go without naming them at all. Ultimately, it is up to the parents to decide what is best for their family. If you are having difficulty agreeing on baby names, it might be helpful to consult with friends or family members to see if they have any ideas or suggestions. In the end, the most important thing is that you and your fiancé are able to communicate and work together to make decisions that are best for your children.If your fiancé wants to name one baby after himself and the other after his mom, it's possible that he might be trying to establish a connection with his mother through his children. This can be a sensitive issue - particularly if his relationship with his mother is complicated or strained. You might want to talk to your fiancé about why he wants to name the babies after his parents, and see if there is a way to incorporate both of your names into the children's names. Alternatively, you could choose different middle names for the babies that reflect both of your families. Whatever you decide, make sure that you are both on board with the chosen names and that they feel like they represent both of your families.
