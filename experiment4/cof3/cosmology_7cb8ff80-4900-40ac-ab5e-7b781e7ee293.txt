Inflationary theory suggests that the universe underwent a period of extremely rapid expansion soon after the Big Bang. One of the effects of inflation is that it stretches out space-time, causing objects to move farther apart over time. This effect is thought to be responsible for the observed cosmic inflation. Quarks are particles that make up protons and neutrons. During inflation, quarks are thought to have become separated from one another. This separation is thought to have occurred because of the expansion of space-time. There is evidence that supports this idea, including the observation that the quark spectrum appears to be different in different parts of the universe. The effects of inflation on quarks are still being studied. The separation of quarks during inflation is thought to have had a significant impact on the evolution of the universe. It is also possible that quark separation played a role in the formation of galaxies and other structures in the cosmos.During inflation, quarks are thought to have become separated from one another.
