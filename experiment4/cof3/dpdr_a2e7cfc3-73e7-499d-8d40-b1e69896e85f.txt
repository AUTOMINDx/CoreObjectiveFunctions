Cortisol is a hormone that is produced by the adrenal glands. It plays a role in regulating blood pressure, heart rate, and the body's response to stress. Cortisol also helps the body break down food into energy. Some people believe that cortisol can cause anxiety. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. In fact, research shows that physical activity can help reduce cortisol levels. This is because moderate to high intensity exercise raises cortisol levels in the short-term, but it also has long-term benefits, such as reducing stress levels. The best way to reduce cortisol levels is by getting regular light exercise. This includes things like walking, yoga, or tai chi. These activities help to improve mood and reduce stress levels.Cortisol is produced in response to stress.
