The current historical consensus on Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil" is that it is a complex and controversial thesis. There are dissenting voices who argue that her thesis does not accurately reflect what happened during the Holocaust, but the majority of historians believe that her analysis is insightful and valuable. Her thesis has been received over time with a mixed reaction, but there is a general consensus that it is an important contribution to our understanding of the Holocaust. Arendt's thesis is that the evil perpetrated by the Nazis during the Holocaust was not done out of hatred or ideological conviction, but rather out of a banal lack of thoughtfulness and compassion. She argues that the perpetrators were not motivated by any sort of diabolical evil, but by a simple lack of consideration for the innocent people they were slaughtering. This, she claims, is what makes the Holocaust so horrifying - it was not carried out by monsters, but by ordinary people who had no trouble killing innocent men,Arendt's argument is that the Nazis carried out the Holocaust not because they were evil, but because they were thoughtless. She claims that the perpetrators were motivated by a lack of consideration for the innocent people they were slaughtering, and that this is what makes the Holocaust so horrifying.
