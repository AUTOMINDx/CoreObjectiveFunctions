The appeal of going to a strip club may vary from person to person, but most people go for the same reason â€” to see naked women. Strip clubs have a long history, dating back to the 18th century when Parisian men would go to brothels to see nude dancers. These establishments gradually evolved into places where people could drink and socialize as well as watch strippers. Today, there are different types of strip clubs, including gentlemen's clubs, bikini bars, and full nudity clubs. While the work can be challenging, strippers generally enjoy their jobs. They typically make good money and can make tips of up to $100 per dance. In addition, they often receive free drinks and sometimes even food from the club.
