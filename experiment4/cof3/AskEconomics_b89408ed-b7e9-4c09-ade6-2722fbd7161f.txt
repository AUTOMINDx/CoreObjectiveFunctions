The fourth edition of The Intelligent Investor was published in 1973, with a new revised edition published in 1999. There have been significant changes in the stock market and economy over the past forty years, and therefore there are some differences in terminology and statements made between the two editions that may be unfamiliar to readers today. For instance, a "blue chip" stock referred to a well-established company with a long track record of profitability and dividends in the early 1970s, but is now more commonly used to describe a high-quality, low-risk investment. Additionally, while Benjamin Graham's advice to "select issues with a margin of safety" is timeless, his guidance on target prices may be less applicable in a market where stocks are trading at all-time highs. Despite these shifts, The Intelligent Investor is still widely considered one of the most influential books on investing ever written. The key to understanding and applying Graham's advice is to read it critically in light of current conditions. For example- In the section on diversification, Graham recommends investing in no more than ten different issues. - While not always possible, he suggests that investors try to buy stocks at prices below their estimated intrinsic value. - He also recommends that investors maintain a 'margin of safety' by only buying stocks when they are priced well below their estimated worth.
