Ping is a computer network tool used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network and measure the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to that destination host. Round-trip time is also referred to as latency, and ping programs use the latency measurement to calculate an approximate round-trip time in milliseconds. Pings are measured in milliseconds because it takes about 1 millisecond for a signal to travel one foot. High ping can be caused by many factors, such as a overloaded network, a problem on the destination host, or a problem with the network route between the two hosts. When troubleshooting high ping, it's important to determine where the problem is. One way to do this is by using an internet speed test or a PC ping test. An internet speed test will give you an idea of how much bandwidth your connection can handle. The test measures both download and upload speeds and will also show you your ping time.
