1. The specific gravity of honey is about 1.5 times the specific gravity of water. This means that honey will be 1.5 times as dense as water. 2. There are several factors that dictate the speed at which a fluid can be displaced. The most important factors are the surface tension of the fluid and the viscosity of the fluid. The surface tension of a fluid is a measure of how strongly the molecules in the fluid are bonded to each other. The higher the surface tension, the slower the fluid can be displaced. The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of how thick or viscous the fluid is. The thicker or more viscous the fluid, the slower it will flow. 3. The surface tension of water is much higher than the surface tension of honey. This means that water will be harder to displace than honey. 4. The specific gravity and surface tension of honey and water compare as follows: -The specific gravity and surface tension of honey are both higher than the specific gravity and surface tension of water. This means that honey will be harder to displace than water.
