1) A hydrogen atom or hydrogen-like ion (H or H-) can end up traveling with the beam of protons if it is stripped of its electron and then accelerated to a high speed. The momentum of the atom or ion is determined by its mass and velocity. 2) The momentum of a hydrogen atom or hydrogen-like ion (H or H-) is determined by its mass and velocity. For example, a proton with a mass of 1.673 x 10-27 kg has a momentum of 9.46 x 1028 kg m/s. A hydrogen atom or hydrogen-like ion with a mass of 1.0078 amu has a momentum of 9.46 x 1028 kg m/s. 3) Magnets are used to bend the path of protons so that they can hit their target. The strength and orientation of the magnets affects the degree to which the protons are bent.The strength and orientation of magnets affects the degree to which protons are bent.
