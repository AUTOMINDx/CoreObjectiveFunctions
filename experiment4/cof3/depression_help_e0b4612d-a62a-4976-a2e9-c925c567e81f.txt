There are many ways to deal with anxiety without burdening others. One way is to take a break and go for a walk. Taking some deep breaths can also help clear your mind and help you focus. Another way is to express your anxiety in a letter or journal. This can help you process your feelings and work through them. You can also try talking to a friend or family member about your anxiety, but make sure to be specific about what you need from them. For example, if you need them to listen but not offer advice, let them know. Finally, remember that everyone is different and there is no one right way to deal with anxiety. What works for one person may not work for another, so find what works for you and stick with it.One way to deal with anxiety without burdening others is to take a break and go for a walk.
