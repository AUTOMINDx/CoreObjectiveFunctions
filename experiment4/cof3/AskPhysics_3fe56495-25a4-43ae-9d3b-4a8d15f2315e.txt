In order to understand why it is not obvious that the future is predetermined, it is important to first understand what this concept actually means. Predeterminism is the philosophical theory that all events are predetermined by some previous event or cause. This means that everything that will happen in the future has been determined by something that happened in the past. There are a few flaws in this logic when applied to our universe. Firstly, if everything was predetermined, then why would we even bother trying to do anything? If the future is already set in stone, then our actions canâ€™t possibly make a difference. In addition, our universe is a complex and chaotic place, with many variables and factors at play. It is impossible to know all of the factors that contribute to any given event, let alone determine them all ahead of time. This makes predeterminism an ineffective explanation for how our universe works. Finally, if free will does not exist because the future is predetermined, then that would mean thatOur actions are not under our control, which would fundamentally change the concept of free will.
