As a first-year PhD student or early career academic, it can be difficult to navigate and deal with misgendering. It can be frustrating and even invalidating to have your gender identity disregarded or questioned. However, there are ways to assert your gender identity and deal with misgendering. First, it is important to be aware of the different ways in which you may be misgendered. This includes incorrect pronouns, using the wrong name, or referring to you as "he" or "him" when you use "she" or "her". Second, always correct someone if they use the wrong pronouns for you. This can be done in a polite and professional manner. For example, you might say "I prefer she/her pronouns, thank you." Third, stay informed about your rights as a transgender person and know what resources are available to you. There are many organizations that support transgender rights, such as the Transgender Law Center or Lambda LegalThere are many things you can do to be more specific when it comes to asserting your gender identity. For example, you can keep a list of correct pronouns handy and refer to it when someone uses the wrong ones. You can also wear clothing and accessories that express your gender identity. And finally, you can keep a journal where you document your experiences with misgendering and how you deal with them. This can be helpful in understanding and addressing the issue more effectively.
