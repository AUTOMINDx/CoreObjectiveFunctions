If you're uncomfortable with friends sending you TikToks about your chronic illness, there are a few things you can do. You can talk to your friends about why the videos make you uncomfortable and see if they can stop sending them. You can also unfollow or block the friends who are sending you TikToks that make you feel uncomfortable. If you find that the jokes and humor your friends are sending are mocking your chronic illness, it's important to talk to them about why this is hurtful and offensive. You may need to set some boundaries with these friends and explain that you're not comfortable with jokes that mock your health condition. If they continue to send these kinds of videos, it may be best to distance yourself from these friends.One example of an instance where someone might feel uncomfortable with friends sending them TikToks about their chronic illness is when those videos are making fun of the person's health condition. For example, if a friend sends you a video that laughs at your inability to walk or breathe, this might be too much for some people to handle. In cases like this, it's important to talk to your friends about why the videos make you uncomfortable. If they don't stop sending the videos after you talk to them, you might need to unfollow or block them.
