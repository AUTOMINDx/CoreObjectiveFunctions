There has been mixed reception to Sean Carroll's work within academic philosophy. Some commentators, like Carroll himself, view him as working in the naturalist tradition of philosophy of science. Others argue that he employs a broadly metaphysical framework in his work and that, as a result, his views are not naturalist at all. A central point of contention is Carroll's embrace of dualism â€“ the view that there are two substances or types of reality, mental and physical. Some argue that this amounts to idealism, the view that only mental entities exist. Others maintain that Carroll preserves materialism by arguing that physical entities are composed of mental properties. There is also disagreement about the role of idealism in Carroll's thinking. Some see it as playing a central role while others argue that it is only a minor part of his overall view.Some commentators, like Carroll himself, view him as working in the naturalist tradition of philosophy of science.
