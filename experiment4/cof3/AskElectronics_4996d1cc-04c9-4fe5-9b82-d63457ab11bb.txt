Solders are usually composed of a tin and lead alloy, which has a low melting point. The most common solder used in controllers is a 60/40 Tin-Lead alloy, which has a melting point of 183°C. If you need to desolder solder from a controller, there are a few tips that can help make the process easier. First, use a soldering iron with a small tip so that you have more control over the amount of heat being applied. Also, make sure your soldering iron is properly calibrated so that you're not applying too much or too little heat. When desoldering solder from a controller, it's important to avoid overheating the component. This can cause damage to the component and may even lead to a fire. So, always make sure to keep a steady hand and use as little heat as possible when desoldering.The most common solder used in controllers is a 60/40 Tin-Lead alloy, which has a melting point of 183°C.
