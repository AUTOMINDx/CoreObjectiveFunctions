There are a few different ways that you can make exercise a habit. You can set a specific time every day for when you will exercise, and make it an important part of your daily routine. You can also try to make a game out of it, and find exercises that are fun and enjoyable for you. Some people find that working out with friends makes it more fun, while others prefer to listen to music or watch TV while they work out. It's important to find something that you will enjoy, so that you will be more likely to stick with it. If you're someone who is relatively sedentary, you may want to start with shorter, easier exercises at first. Walking is a great way to get started, and there are many ways to make it more challenging, such as adding hills or speed walking. Other good exercises for people who are just starting out include cycling, swimming, and yoga. It's important not to overdo it at first, especially if youaren't used to exercising. Gradually increase the length and intensity of your workouts as you become more comfortable with them. When you're out of shape, it can be difficult to start exercising, but it's not impossible. The best way to start is by gradually adding a little bit more activity to your day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, or park further away from the store when you go shopping. Once you've built up some endurance, try doing some simple exercises at home. There are many great resources online that can help you get started, such as fitness videos or routines that only require a few pieces of equipment. Just make sure to start slow and work your way up to more challenging exercises.
