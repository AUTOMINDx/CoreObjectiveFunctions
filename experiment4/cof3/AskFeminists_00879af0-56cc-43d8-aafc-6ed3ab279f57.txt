The pro-life/forced-birth group called "Live Action" has released a YouTube ad called "Abortion Rights Are Pro-choice Men's Rights." The ad is titled "Her Body, Her Problem" and features a woman talking about her choice to have an abortion. The woman talks about how she was faced with a decision between having an abortion or becoming a single mother, and she chose the abortion. The ad then flashes to images of Republican anti-choice states and asks "What kind of men would take away my right to choose?" The ad ends with the phrase "Defend Abortion Rights. Vote Pro-Choice." The ad is designed to appeal to pro-choice men, who Live Action presumably hopes will be more likely to vote for pro-choice candidates in order to defend women's rights to an abortion. The ad specifically targets Republican anti-choice states as opposed to Democratic pro-choice states. This may be an attempt by Live Action to get moreFor example, which states are mentioned in the ad?
