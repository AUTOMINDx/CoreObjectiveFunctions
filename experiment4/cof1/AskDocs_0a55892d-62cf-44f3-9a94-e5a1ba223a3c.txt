This person's Reddit posts describe a situation where they have a red bump inside their bellybutton that has been growing for weeks. White pus has been coming out of the bump, and no doctors have been able to give them a diagnosis. They are concerned about what is happening and have uploaded pictures of the bump and the white ball that came out of it. There could be many potential causes for this individual's symptoms, including infection, tumor, or even cancer. If this person has not been picking at their bellybutton, then it is most likely an infection caused by something like lint or bacteria getting trapped in the navel. Treatment options could include antibiotics if it is determined that there is an infection, surgery if there is a tumor or cancer present, or simply keeping the area clean and dry if it is a benign condition.
