There is a great deal of suffering present in these Reddit posts. The user seems to be struggling to understand the cause of inflation, and is looking for answers. It is possible that inflation is being caused by companies taking larger profits. If this is the case, then it may be due to a lack of competition or barriers to entry that are preventing other businesses from entering the market and driving down prices. Alternatively, it may be that companies are able to raise prices without being undercut because the demand for their products is outpacing the supply. This could be due to a number of factors, such as population growth or increased consumer spending. If the user is finding this argument persuasive, they might consider looking into ways to promote competition or increase the supply of goods in order to bring down prices.
