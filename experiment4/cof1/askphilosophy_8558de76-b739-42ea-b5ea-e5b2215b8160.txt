I would characterize the suffering present in these Reddit posts as existential. The users are questioning the morality of their actions in the face of climate change. They are worried about the consequences of their travel for both themselves and for the world. The causes of this suffering may be a sense of guilt or responsibility for climate change. The users may also feel overwhelmed by the scale of the problem and unsure of what they can do to make a difference. Potential solutions for the users could include researching their travel destinations to find those with lower carbon footprints, considering alternative forms of transportation such as trains or buses, or even cancelling their trip altogether.
