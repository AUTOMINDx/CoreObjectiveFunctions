The Reddit user is asking who is less likely to infect their elderly grandma - a vaccinated, untested visitor, or an unvaccinated one who took an antigen test in the last 48 hours? It is difficult to know for certain who is less likely to infect the elderly grandma, as there are many variables at play. However, it seems that the unvaccinated person who has taken an antigen test in the last 48 hours would be the safer option. This is because they have already taken measures to be aware of their health status and are less likely to be carrying a disease.
