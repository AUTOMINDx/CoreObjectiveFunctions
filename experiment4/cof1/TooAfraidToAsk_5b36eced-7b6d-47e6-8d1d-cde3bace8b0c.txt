This user experiences a great deal of suffering caused by other people. The first example is from someone who they were hooking up with and told them that they shouldn't moan because it would be difficult to know what feels good if they are already making noise. The second example is from someone who was told they seem overreacting and being dramatic when they came. This type of criticism can be extremely damaging to someone's self-esteem. In both cases, the suffering is caused by someone else. In cases like this, it is important to have a supportive network of people who will make you feel good about yourself. Additionally, therapy may be beneficial in helping the person understand why they receive this type of criticism and how to cope with it.
