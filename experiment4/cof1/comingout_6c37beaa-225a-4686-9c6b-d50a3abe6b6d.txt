The user suffers from a lack of recognition and respect for their gender identity. They have come out to their mother, but the mother has not responded in a way that the user finds acceptable. The mother continues to use the wrong pronouns and refer to the user as a girl, which is very hurtful and invalidating. The cause of this suffering is the mother's unwillingness or inability to learn and use the correct pronouns. A potential solution would be for the mother to attend a workshop or read some materials about transgender issues so that she can better understand her child's experience.
