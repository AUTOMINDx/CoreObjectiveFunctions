Based on the information in the Reddit posts, it seems that this user is experiencing some suffering because of their choice of major. Specifically, the girl they were talking to became disappointed when they revealed that they are studying computer science. It is possible that this reaction was due to the nerdy stereotypes associated with computers, which may have convinced the girl that this user is not a good match for her. If this is the case, then the suffering for this user comes from feeling like they are not good enough for someone they are interested in. There are several potential solutions for this type of suffering. First, the user could try to counteract the nerdy stereotype by presenting themselves in a different light. For example, they could talk about their passion for computer science and how it has helped them grow as a person. Additionally, they could find other women who share their interest in computer science and build relationships with them. This could help to dispel the idea that all women dislike computer science majors and
