This person is suffering because of their relationship with a married man. The man has cheated on the user multiple times, and the most recent betrayal was finding out the man had cheated on her with his ex-wife. This was also the man's third child. The user reports having no patience for her newborn, feeling anger towards him, and experiencing intrusive thoughts about herself and the baby. The user has hit their lowest point and does not know what to do. The suffering in this post could be caused by a number of things: the emotional pain of being betrayed multiple times, the stress of having a newborn, or guilt over what role the user may have played in the man's infidelity. Potential solutions for this user include therapy to help address the emotions caused by the relationship, support groups for single mothers, and/or counseling for guilt or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
