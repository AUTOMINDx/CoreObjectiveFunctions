This user is suffering from a lack of fit with their therapist. They may feel unsafe sharing their true thoughts and feelings, or they may not feel that they are able to be themselves around this therapist. It's important to find a therapist who you feel safe and comfortable sharing with, in order to get the most out of therapy. The user may want to consider gently telling their therapist that they are looking for someone else who is a better fit. Thanking their therapist for their time and effort is also important.
