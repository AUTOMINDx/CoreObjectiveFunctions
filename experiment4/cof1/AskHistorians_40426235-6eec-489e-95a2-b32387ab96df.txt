This Redditor's question is difficult to answer. The genocide of Native Americans is not spoken of with the same vein as the Jewish Holocaust, for a variety of reasons. One reason might be that the number of deaths is significantly greater in the case of the Native Americans. According to conservative estimates, 90% of the Native American population died as a result of European colonization. This number is significantly higher than the death toll of the Holocaust. Another reason why this event may not be spoken about in the same way is because it occurred over a longer period of time. The genocide of the Native Americans began with Christopher Columbus' arrival in 1492 and continued until 1900. The Holocaust, however, occurred from 1933-1945. Finally, some people might argue that the treatment of the Native Americans was worse than that of the Jews during the Holocaust.
