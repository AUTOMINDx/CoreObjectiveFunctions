It is unclear from the post what the user's relationship to their parents is. However, it seems that the user is curious about their astrological compatibility with them. This could be due to a lack of understanding and appreciation for their parents, or due to a desire for greater closeness with them. If the user is seeking to understand their parents better, then this could be a positive pursuit. However, if the user is seeking to repair a damaged relationship, then this could be more difficult. One potential source of suffering for the user could be a feeling of disconnection from their parents. If this is the case, then counseling or therapy could be recommended in order to help the user build a stronger connection with them. Alternatively, if the user feels they do not understand their parents well enough, learning more about astrology could give them some insight into their personalities.
