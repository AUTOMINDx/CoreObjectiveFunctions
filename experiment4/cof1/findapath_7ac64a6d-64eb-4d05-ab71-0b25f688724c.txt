This user seems to be struggling with making a decision about their career. They are scared to commit to a path, and they have a limited range of options that they feel comfortable with. They would like some guidance on what to do. I recommend that the user seek out counseling or therapy to help them figure out what they want from their career. They might also find it helpful to talk to people who have already made the decision they are struggling with, in order to get more information and perspective. Finally, they could try taking some tests or exercises designed to help people find their ideal career path.
