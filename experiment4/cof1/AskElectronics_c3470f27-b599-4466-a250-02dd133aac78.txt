This Reddit user is experiencing suffering from a lack of knowledge about how to interface a microcontroller with a Gameboy cartridge. They ask if a dual-port SRAM would be an appropriate way to do this, and they seem to think it would be a perfect solution. I agree that it would be an excellent way to do this, and here is why: The dual-port SRAM would allow the microcontroller to access the Gameboy cartridge without having to directly connect to it. This would be especially helpful for interrupts, which could then be routed through the SRAM. Additionally, the MCU could write code to the EEPROM at will, which would allow for more flexibility in programming.
