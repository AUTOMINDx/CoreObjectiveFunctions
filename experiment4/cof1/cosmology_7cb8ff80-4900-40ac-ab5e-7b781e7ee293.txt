It is hypothesized that inflation caused quark pairs to be rapidly and powerfully separated from one another. This may have generated many quark pairs. It is unknown whether inflation adds energy to the system when it separates quarks in the same way that dark energy isn't applying a force accelerating galaxies away from us, but is merely an expansion of the space between. If this hypothesis is correct, then it may be possible to solve this user's problem with further research into the nature of inflation.
