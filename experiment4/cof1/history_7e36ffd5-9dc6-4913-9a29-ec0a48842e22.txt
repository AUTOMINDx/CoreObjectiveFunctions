This user is evidently interested in the process of becoming a knight in the Middle Ages. They ask about the difference between squires and knights, and wonder if there is a specific formula for ascending from one rank to the other. There was no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the process of becoming a knight varied from place to place and time to time. In general, however, one could become a knight either by birthright or by demonstrating achievements in battle or some other area of life. There was no specific formula, but military service was often seen as the key qualification for knighthood.
