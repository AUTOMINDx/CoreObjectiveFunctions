The user is experiencing conflict and anxiety as a result of their strained relationship with their father. The father has agreed not to drink alcohol on Christmas if the son agrees to visit, but there is doubt about whether or not the father actually believes he has a problem. The son wishes he had a different father so that he wouldn't have to worry about this conflict. The user could try to talk to their father about the situation and why they are feeling conflicted. If the father is not willing or able to acknowledge the issue, then setting boundaries for how and when they interact with each other may be helpful. The son could also find support from friends or family members who can listen and offer advice.
