The user appears to be experiencing significant financial hardship. The cause may be job loss, as the user's partner has lost his job. The user has moved in with the partner and his daughter, and is evidently helping to pay bills. The user seems to resent this, as indicated by their comment that they "wanted to celebrate at a nice restaurant near us, however it was closed." They are also bitter about the quality of the cake their partner made, which he apologizes for. It is possible that the user's resentment stems from a feeling of being taken for granted. They may feel that their contributions are not appreciated. It might be helpful for the user to express their feelings to their partner directly. This could lead to a discussion about the financial situation and potential solutions.
