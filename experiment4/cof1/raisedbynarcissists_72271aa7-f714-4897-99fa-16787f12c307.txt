The user is experiencing suffering due to their grandmother's physical and sexual boundary violations. The grandmother is apparently a narcissist who bases her self-esteem on her looks, and she is exceedingly critical of the user. She also micromanages the user's grooming, often employing physical force to do so. Additionally, the grandmother constantly comments on the user's body odor, despite the fact that nobody else seems to notice anything wrong. There are a few potential solutions for the user. One solution could be to speak with a therapist about the situation and explore ways to deal with the boundary violations. Another solution could be to set clear boundaries with the grandmother and insist that she respects them. If those boundaries are not respected, then the user could remove themselves from the situation as much as possible. Finally, it might be helpful for the user to educate themselves on narcissism and its effects, in order to better understand why their grandmother behaves in such a harmful way.
