This user seems to be seeking therapy in order to address some suffering that they are experiencing. The two therapists that they have had in the past were not very helpful, as they just agreed with the user and offered platitudes. The new therapist seems more promising, as they are an "actionary therapist" who will give the user practical tools to deal with their problems. In the first session, the therapist already gave the user an assignment, which seems hopeful.
