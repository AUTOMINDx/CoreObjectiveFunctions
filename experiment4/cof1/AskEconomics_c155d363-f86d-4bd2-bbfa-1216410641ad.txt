The user appears to be struggling to find information on the relationship between labour flexibility and economic growth. There may be many reasons why this is difficult for the user, including a lack of relevant expertise or lack of access to reliable information sources. The user asks if there is any measurable elasticity between the two concepts, but this question may be impossible to answer definitively. Economic growth is a complex phenomenon that is affected by many factors, and it is likely that labour flexibility is just one of these factors. If the goal is to increase economic growth, then labour flexibility may be one tool that can be used, but it is not clear if it is always effective.
