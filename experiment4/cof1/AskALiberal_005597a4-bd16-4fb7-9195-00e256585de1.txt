The Redditor's post concerns a comment made by a commentator on Fox News blaming Pete Buttigieg for a deadly truck crash. The poster is frustrated and confused by the commentator's statements and wants to know how to deal with the Right when they make similar claims. It is possible that the commenter is simply uninformed and has mistaken Buttigieg for someone else who was actually responsible for the licensing requirements. Alternatively, the commentator may be using Buttigieg as a scapegoat to deflect blame from the actual culprits. In either case, it is important to correct the misinformation and hold the Right accountable for their false claims.
