It is difficult to say with certainty what motivated Trotsky's actions. Some historians argue that he was working against the fascist groups in Europe, while others claim that he was in league with them. Regardless of his motives, the purges led by Stalin were devastating for the Soviet Union. Tens of thousands of people were killed or exiled, which disrupted the country's political and social stability. There is no easy solution to this type of suffering, but it is important to remember that it occurred during a very difficult time in history.
