The user may be feeling insecure around those who are more charismatic and have a higher emotional intelligence. Perhaps they feel that they must compete or compare themselves to these people, and this causes suffering. Additionally, the user may doubt whether these people are genuine in their interactions with others or if they are simply manipulating them for their own gain. If this is the case, the user could benefit from some introspection to better understand their own insecurities and vulnerabilities. They could also work on building up their self-confidence so that they do not feel so threatened by others.
