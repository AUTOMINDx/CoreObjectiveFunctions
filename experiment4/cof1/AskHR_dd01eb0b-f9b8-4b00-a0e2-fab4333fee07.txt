The user seems to be experiencing a great deal of suffering due to the power dynamics in their workplace. It is clear that the user is more senior than their direct manager, and yet the direct manager is taking all the credit for the user's work. This may cause the user to feel devalued and sidelined. The user may find relief if their direct manager were to openly acknowledge their contributions. Alternatively, the user could speak to their direct manager about their concerns and work together to create a more collaborative relationship.
