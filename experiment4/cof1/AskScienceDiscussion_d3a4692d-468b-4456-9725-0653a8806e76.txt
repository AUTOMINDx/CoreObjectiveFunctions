The user's question raises a number of interesting points about the development of life on earth. If a human were sent back millions of years into the past, would they be able to survive? Would they be able to interact with or alter the course of development of current life forms? There is no easy answer, as so much depends on the specifics of the situation. However, it is reasonable to think that a human body suddenly inserted into the distant past would have some kind of impact, even if it is not immediately clear what that impact would be.
