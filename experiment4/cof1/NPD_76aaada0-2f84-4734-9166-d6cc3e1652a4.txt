The user seems to be in recovery from narcissism. They are asking their therapist about what this involves. The therapist explains that pathological narcissism is about using maladaptive methods to regulate self esteem. Recovery happens when the self esteem is regulated adaptively, when the person feels happy, fulfilled, and content in life. The therapist also says that once the person is recovered, their brain will be similar to someone who does not have narcissism.
