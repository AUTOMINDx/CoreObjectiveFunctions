This Reddit user experiences a great deal of suffering due to her mentally ill sister. The sister has caused emotional pain, financial damage, and disrupted personal relationships. The poster describes feeling apathy towards her sister and a desire for her not to be at the wedding. The poster's family is pushing for the sister to be included as a bridesmaid, but the poster does not want this. There could be many possible solutions for this user. One solution could be for the sister to have a more limited role at the wedding, such as a guest instead of a bridesmaid. This would reduce stress on the poster, her family, and her sister. Another possible solution could be for the poster to talk to a mental health professional about how to best deal with her sister's illness.
