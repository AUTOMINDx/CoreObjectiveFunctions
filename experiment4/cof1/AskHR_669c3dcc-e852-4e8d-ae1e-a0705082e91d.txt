The user is experiencing suffering due to her situation at work. It appears that she was hired into a new role and then discovered she was pregnant, which made her disabled according to her HR department. Despite her disability, she has been held to a quota since November and has not met it the past two months. She has since filed paperwork for ADA accommodations, but two weeks after doing so was put on a PiP. The user is unclear what to do because meeting quota is an essential part of the role, but her disability prevents her from doing so. The user's doctors are concerned about retaliation if she takes too much leave. It is recommended that the user speak with an attorney about unemployment benefits and other social supports available to her in her state. The user should also continue to document everything that happens at work, in case there are any retaliatory actions taken against her.
