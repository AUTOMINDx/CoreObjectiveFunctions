There is significant suffering present in this post. The user describes their mother as having disappeared four years ago and being a completely different person. The mother was formerly a supportive figure in the user's life, but she has since become heavily religious to the point where she doesn't have time for her family anymore. The mother also pushes her religion onto the user, which is causing the user significant stress. The user finishes by expressing fear for their future with such significant burdens in their life. The causes of this suffering are likely complicated, but one possible factor could be a mental health condition triggered by the religious zealotry. This condition could have caused the mother to withdraw from her family and become obsessed with religious material. A potential solution for this situation would be for the family to seek psychiatric help for the mother. This would allow her to address her mental health condition and improve her relationship with her family.
