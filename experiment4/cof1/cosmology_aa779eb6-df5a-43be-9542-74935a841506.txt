This Reddit user is concerned about the scientific evidence for the expansion of the universe. They ask if the observed redshift of distant galaxies might instead be caused by something else, like light losing energy over time. They wonder if there are any other proofs of universe expansion. It is possible that this person is skeptical of scientific theories because they feel like they don't have a good understanding of them. They may also be unsure if they can trust data that has been collected over immense distances and amounts of time. In order to ease their concerns, more educational resources on universe expansion could be provided. Alternatively, they could explore ways to personally experiment with extreme conditions in order to better understand the effects of distance and time on light.
