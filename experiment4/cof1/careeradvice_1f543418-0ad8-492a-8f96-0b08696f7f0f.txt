The user seems to be experiencing a great deal of suffering as a result of their decision to embellish their salary. They may feel regret for lying to potential employers, worry that they will lose the opportunity altogether, and frustration at their own inexperience in negotiating. It is possible that the causes of this individual's suffering are self-inflicted, caused by poor decision-making or lack of experience. However, it is also possible that the user is experiencing legitimate suffering as a result of unfair pay and limited opportunities for advancement within their company. In this case, some potential solutions may include seeking outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, researching average salaries for their position and experience level, or speaking with others who have negotiated similar salaries.
