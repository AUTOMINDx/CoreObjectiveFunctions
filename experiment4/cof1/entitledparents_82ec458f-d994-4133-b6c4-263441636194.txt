This user's post describes suffering caused by an uninvited child at an adult Christmas party. The child was not appropriately supervised by their parents, which resulted in the child disturbing the hosts and guests, as well as damaging property. The host suggests that the parents should have known better than to bring their child to an adult party. I recommend that the user talk to the parents about their concerns and ask them to be more responsible in the future when bringing their child to events.
