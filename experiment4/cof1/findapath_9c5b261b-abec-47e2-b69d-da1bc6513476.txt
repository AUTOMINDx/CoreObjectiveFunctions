This user is offering to help others for free by rewriting their job descriptions. It seems that the user has a lot of experience and expertise in the field, and is likely very qualified to do so. It's admirable that the user wants to give back to the community and help others out, especially during the holiday season. However, it's important to note that this is not a free service, and that people should not contact the user months down the line asking for help.
