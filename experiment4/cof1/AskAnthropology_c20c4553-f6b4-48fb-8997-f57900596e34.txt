The user is suffering from indecision about their career path. They are interested in social issues, languages, cultures, and ethnicities, but they are worried that they will regret not pursuing this interest as a career. They also wonder if an Anthropology degree would be a wise investment. Reddit users have told them that an Anthropology degree is a "useless degree with no jobs after it." The user is seeking more information to help them make a decision. I recommend that the user speak with a career counselor to get more specific advice about their options. I also advise the user to do more research on the career prospects for Anthropology graduates.
