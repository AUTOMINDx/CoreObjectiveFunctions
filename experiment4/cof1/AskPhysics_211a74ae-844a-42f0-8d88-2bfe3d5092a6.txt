The user's posts describe the suffering of a character in a book who fell into honey from a great height. The character lived, but with an irritating cleanup needed. Honey is more dense than water, and has a higher specific gravity. This means that the character would have fallen faster in honey than in water, and would have been more severely injured upon impact. Water has more surface tension than honey. This means that the character would have been able to swim or float for a longer period of time in water than in honey.
