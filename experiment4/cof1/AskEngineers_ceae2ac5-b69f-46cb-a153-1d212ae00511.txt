This Reddit user may be feeling overwhelmed by the demands of the engineering profession. The first paragraph suggests that the user feels that they are not living up to others' perceptions of what an engineer should be like. This may be due to a lack of confidence in their abilities, or it may be due to actual stressful demands of the job. The second paragraph asks for feedback on the accuracy of the user's preconceived notions about engineering, and this might be a way to gain some understanding of what parts of the job are more challenging. The last paragraph asks for feedback on the level of creativity involved in engineering. This might be another way of gauging how comfortable the user feels with their current skillset.
