This user is experiencing suffering because of an ad that is deliberately dishonest and paints pro-choice men in a negative light. The ad is framed in such a way that implies that it's bad for men to want to have sex with women without becoming a father. This could lead to men feeling guilty or ashamed for wanting to have sex without having children. Additionally, the user does not agree with the primary reasoning for why men should be pro-choice, which is because they respect the bodily autonomy of women and people with wombs.
