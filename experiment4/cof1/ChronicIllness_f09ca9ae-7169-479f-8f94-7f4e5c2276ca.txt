The user in this post seems to be suffering from chronic pain, which makes performing everyday tasks difficult. The user asks for advice on how to make cleaning easier, specifically mentioning that bending down to clean surfaces or pick up laundry is painful and difficult. The user also mentions having a condition called POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, which can cause dizziness and low blood pressure. One potential solution for the user might be to try a steam cleaner, as this would take some of the physical labor out of the task. Another solution could be to get a helper to assist with lighter tasks such as laundry, or to find a more ergonomic way to complete these tasks, like using a lightweight cordless vacuum cleaner.
