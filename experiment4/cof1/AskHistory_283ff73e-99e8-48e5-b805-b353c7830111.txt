It is difficult to know what Tsarist Russia and Imperial China thought of each other from the 15th to 19th centuries. It is possible that they had a mutual respect for one another, or that they saw each other as rivals. It is also possible that one empire felt superior to the other, or that one empire caused suffering for the other. If I were to make a recommendation, I would suggest that the two empires should have studied one another more closely. This would have allowed them to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and may have led to better relations.
