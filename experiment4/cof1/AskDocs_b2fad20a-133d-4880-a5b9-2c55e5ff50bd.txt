This Reddit user's husband is experiencing a great deal of pain and other symptoms that are likely due to the COVID virus. The wife is worried about him and wants to know if they should take him to the ER. The pain that the husband is experiencing is likely due to the virus itself, or to the fever that is often associated with it. The shivering, overheating/chilling, and disorientation could also be due to the virus. The fear that the husband is feeling is also understandable, given the situation. If this were my loved one, I would recommend that they seek medical attention. The ER can provide treatment for the virus and will also be able to perform other tests to determine if he has COVID.
