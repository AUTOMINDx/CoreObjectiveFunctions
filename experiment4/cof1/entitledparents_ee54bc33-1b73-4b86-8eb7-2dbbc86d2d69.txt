The post describes an incident where a person, Karen, became scared and ran away from another person, who happened to be black.Racism may have been a factor in Karen's decision to run away. It is possible that she was afraid of the black person for racist reasons, or that she simply felt uncomfortable and unsafe around them. There are many potential solutions for this type of situation. One solution might be to provide education on racism and its effects, so that people can better understand why someone may behave in a racist way. Another solution might be to create more opportunities for positive interactions between people of different races, in order to break down the barriers that cause fear and misunderstanding.
