This user seems to be suffering from emotional abuse from their parents. The mother seems to be the main perpetrator, inflicting emotional pain as a way to get revenge on the child. The father tries to protect the child, but ultimately can't do much to stop the abuse. The child themselves seems mostly indifferent to the whole situation, avoiding contact with the mother as much as possible. There is some suggestion of economic hardship on the part of the family, as arcade games and other entertainment are seen as a luxury. Additionally, the child's sister seems to be a participant in the abuse, starting rumors and tattling on the child to get them in trouble. The child's reaction is generally one of resignation, accepting that this is just how things are and that there is nothing they can do to change it. In general, this user could benefit from some counseling or therapy to help them deal with the emotional pain they are experiencing.
