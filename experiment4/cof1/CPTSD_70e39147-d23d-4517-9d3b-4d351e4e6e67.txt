The Reddit user seems to be suffering from emotional pain caused by the neglectful behavior of their parents. The user points to the fact that their therapist focused on the abuse inflicted by one parent, while ignoring the emotional neglect suffered from the other. This may have exacerbated the problem and led to a long period of depression and grief. The user suggests that seeking out positive relationships with people who love and accept you can help heal some of the emotional pain.
