The author of this post is suffering from embarrassment and confusion. They express concern that their thesis, which is about conservation, capitalism, and zoos, will be read by people they don't know and are not expecting. This could lead to criticism or judgement that the author fears. They also worry that this experience will prevent them from publishing anything in the future. One potential solution for the user's concerns would be to anonymize their thesis before submitting it to the open access repository.
