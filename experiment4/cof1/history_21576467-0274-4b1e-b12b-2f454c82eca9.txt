This subreddit appears to be for people who have questions about history that are too simple, short, or silly to warrant their own post. The questions posted in this thread appear to be serious in nature, but the answers provided are often humorous. This could be a fun place to ask historical questions that you're not sure about, because the users are likely to provide thorough and informative answers. However, I would not recommend asking joke questions here, as the other users might not find them funny.
