This user is struggling with quantum field theory. They find the fields to be nothing more than mathematical abstractions and are wondering if QFT is using a similar idea to HF to simplify dealing with multiple particles. This can be difficult to understand and frustrating for students. Potential solutions include extra help from professors or finding a tutor, more practice problems, and/or a review book specific to quantum field theory.
