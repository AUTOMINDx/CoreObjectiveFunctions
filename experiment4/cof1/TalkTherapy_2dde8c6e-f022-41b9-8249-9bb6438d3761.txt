The user seems to suffer from anxiety and stress, which they manage with therapy. The therapy sessions seem to help, but the user feels like they can't stop thinking about them even outside of the session. This may be due to the fact that they are using their therapy sessions as a way to deal with their anxiety and stress, and is a common occurrence. It is suggested that the user find other methods to cope with their anxiety and stress, such as exercise or writing, in order to allow them to fully enjoy their time outside of therapy.
