The redditor's grandson has a red spot on his face. The spot is larger and rougher than an eraser-sized spot and there are no other spots on his body. The redditor does not know what the spot is and asks for input from other users. The red spot could be caused by a number of things, such as allergies, a rash, or acne. If the grandson is taking no medication and there are no other symptoms, then it is likely that the spot is benign. However, if the grandson is exhibiting any other symptoms, such as itchiness or discomfort, then it is best to have him examined by a doctor.
