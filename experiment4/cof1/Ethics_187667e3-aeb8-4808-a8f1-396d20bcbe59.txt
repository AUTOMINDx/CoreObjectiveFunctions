The Reddit user is describing a situation in which a child is at risk of death due to the actions of Child Protective Services workers. It is speculated that the workers are following department policy, which requires them to leave the child in danger of contracting Covid despite the high chance of death. The parents of the child accuse the workers of attempted negligent homicide. It is unclear whether or not the workers are acting ethically in this scenario. If given free range within the limits of policy, they may choose to violate policy in order to protect the child.
