The holidays can be a difficult time for many people. I want to thank everyone in this subreddit for sharing their stories, and well done to everyone who has struggled today and got through it. It is important to remember that the holidays can be tough for a lot of us, so don't put too much pressure on yourself. Try to take some time for yourself and remove yourself from any uncomfortable situation if you can.
