It seems like you feel unappreciated by your boyfriend, who is also the father of your stepdaughter. You have been dating for nearly three years and have lived together for the past five months. During that time, you have contributed significantly to the family finances. You suggest going out to eat on your birthday, but when it comes time to pay, your boyfriend says he can't afford it. He makes a cake instead. You should be open and honest with your boyfriend about your feelings. Let him know that you feel taken for granted and that his recent job loss has made things difficult for both of you. Suggest ways that he can make up for this, such as cooking a nicer dinner more often or taking you out for a special occasion. If he is unwilling or unable to do these things, then you may need to reconsider the nature of your relationship.
