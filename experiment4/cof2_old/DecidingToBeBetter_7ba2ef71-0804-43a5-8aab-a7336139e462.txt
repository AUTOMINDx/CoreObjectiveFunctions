This post shows how a small victory can lead to a larger victory. The user was about to harm themselves, but their cat intervened and gave them the affection they needed. The user then decided to do something that would help themselves, like taking their medication on time. This led to them spending more time with their cat and Brushing their teeth earlier than usual. These are all small wins that add up to increased prosperity. There are still gaps in this individual's prosperity, such as the lack of social support. The user could reach out to friends or family members for support when they feel struggling.
