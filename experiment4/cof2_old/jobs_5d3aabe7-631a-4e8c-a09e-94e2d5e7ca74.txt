This Reddit user offers some advice on how to respond when asked about salary requirements in an interview. They suggest not giving a number, but instead saying that you are flexible if the job is a good fit. They provide information on how to respond if the job pays in the range of $17-$23 an hour. If you answer with $16 you’ve sold yourself short, but if you say $30 you’re going to come across as a crazy person. The user recommends talking about your skills and what you bring to the company instead. This is good advice, especially because it puts the power in your hands. You can then negotiate based on the information you have received.
