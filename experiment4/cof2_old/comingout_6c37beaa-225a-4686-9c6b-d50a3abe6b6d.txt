It sounds like it's been a difficult time for you since coming out to your mom about being agender and aroace. From what you've said, it seems like she isn't making an effort to use your correct pronouns, which is causing you a lot of distress. In order for you to feel more prosperous, I would recommend finding someone who can be a support system for you during this time. This could be a friend, family member, or even a therapist. It's important to have someone who understands what you're going through and can help you process these feelings. Additionally, try to take some time for yourself to relax and recharge. Doing things that make you happy will help alleviate some of the stress you're currently feeling.
