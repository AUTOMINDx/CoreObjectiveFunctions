Reddit user, you feel like a burden to those around you and don’t know how to improve your social skills. You want to meet people, but don’t know where to go. I recommend finding a local club or group that interests you and attending their events. You can also look online for social networking groups that cater to your interests. Joining a group is a great way to make friends who share your interests, and it can also help you develop your social skills.
