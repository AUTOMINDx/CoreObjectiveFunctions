It's difficult to say for certain whether or not the US could produce 300,000 planes for military use again. The technology and resources available now are certainly different than they were during WW2. However, if the need arose, it's likely that the US could mobilize the necessary resources to ramp up production. This is a question that deserves further study. In particular, it would be useful to look at what factors led to the US being able to produce so many planes during WW2 and see if those same factors are present today. Some possible gaps in prosperity that could be addressed include: - improved infrastructure and logistics; - increased workforce availability and training; - more advanced production technology.
