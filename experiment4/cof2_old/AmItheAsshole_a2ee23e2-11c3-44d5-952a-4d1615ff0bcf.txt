It is understandable that you feel conflicted about having your sister as a bridesmaid. On one hand, she is family and you feel obligated to have her as part of the wedding party. On the other hand, her mental health issues have caused a great deal of disruption in your life and you would rather not have her as a part of the wedding. I recommend that you have a conversation with your mother about your concerns.Express your feelings honestly and ask her for advice.Your mother likely has more insight into your sister’s condition than you do, so her opinion is valuable. If she agrees that it would be best if your sister did not participate in the wedding, then stand your ground and don’t feel guilty about it.
