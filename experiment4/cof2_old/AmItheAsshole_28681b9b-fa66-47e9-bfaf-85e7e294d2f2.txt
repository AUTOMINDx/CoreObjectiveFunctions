It sounds like you become irritable when your concentration is disrupted. This can be a challenge for people with ADHD, as well as anyone trying to focus on a task. I recommend designating specific times for Ian to ask about the calls, rather than asking continually throughout the call. This way, you can have more uninterrupted time to focus on the conversation. You may also want to consider speaking with him about how his behavior is impacting your ability to concentrate and indicating that it would be helpful if he could refrain from disrupting you in this way.
