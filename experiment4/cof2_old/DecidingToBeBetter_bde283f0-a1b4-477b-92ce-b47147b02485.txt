There are many ways to make exercise a part of your life, even if you haven't been active in the past. One approach is to start small and gradually increase the amount of exercise you do over time. This will help make the transition easier and reduce the risk of getting injured. You could also try incorporating physical activity into your everyday routine, such as taking a walk during your lunch break or going for a light jog after work. If you're having trouble getting motivated, find an exercise buddy or sign up for a class at your local gym. Whatever approach you take, be sure to stay hydrated and take breaks as needed.
