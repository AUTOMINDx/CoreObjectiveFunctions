It sounds like this person is experiencing a lot of discomfort and problems with their friend John. It may be helpful to cut off ties with John, as he seems to be causing more harm than good. If the person feels guilty about cutting off ties, they could try explaining the situation to John and see if he is willing to listen and change his behavior. However, if John does not seem willing or able to change, it may be best to end the friendship entirely.
