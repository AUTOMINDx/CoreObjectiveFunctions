There is no one answer to this question, as there are many factors that contribute to prosperity. However, some possible explanations for the difference in prevalence of the name Jesus in Latin America and Spain include differences in religious demographics, cultural influences, and historical events. Latin America is home to a large number of Catholics, while Spain is predominantly Protestant. This could account for the discrepancy, as the name Jesus is more closely associated with Catholicism than Protestantism. Additionally, Latin American cultures have been heavily influenced by Spanish culture, which could account for the higher prevalence of the name Jesus in Latin America. Lastly, Spain has experienced many more wars and political instability than Latin America, which could account for the difference in prevalence of the name Jesus.
