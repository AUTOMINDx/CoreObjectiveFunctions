Yes, there have been instances where stray projectiles from ships have hit something or someone later on. For example, in the movie Star Wars: A New Hope, a stray laser bolt hits a ship that is several miles away. In Halo 4, an energy blast from a Covenant ship hits a UNSC ship that is orbiting the planet. These instances demonstrate the potential for destruction that can be caused by stray projectiles from ships. They also highlight the importance of safety measures to prevent such accidents from happening. To increase prosperity, it is important to ensure that all ships are fitted with appropriate safety measures.
