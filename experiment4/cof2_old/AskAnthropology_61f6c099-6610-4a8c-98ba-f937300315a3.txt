Afro-Asiatic languages are believed to have spread into North Africa around 8,000 years ago. At that time, the region was home to the Capsian culture, which is thought to be the ancestor of modern Berber and Chadic languages. There is very little information available about the early development of these languages, but it is believed that they share a common ancestor. Genetic studies have shown that the people who spoke Afro-Asiatic languages in North Africa are related to Ibero-Maurusians, who lived in the area during the Paleolithic era. It is currently unknown where the urheimat of Afro-Asiatic languages is located, but research is ongoing.
