It is concerning to see that you are experiencing a medical issue that has not been diagnosed by any doctors. From the information provided, it seems that there is a red bump inside your bellybutton that is growing, and underneath the bump, there is something white and gooey. The general surgeon who you have consulted has referred you for a contrast CT Scan, which will hopefully provide some answers about the cause of this issue. In the meantime, it is important to keep the area clean by regularly cleaning the bump and pus with soap and water. You may also want to consider applying a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection. If the pain becomes too severe, please consult your doctor.
