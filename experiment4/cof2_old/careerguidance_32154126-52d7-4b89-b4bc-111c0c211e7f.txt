It is true that some companies may not be hiring during this time of year, but there are also many companies that are always looking for new employees. I suggest you explore different job boards and use social media to find leads for jobs that you might be interested in. Additionally, it is important to stay positive and take action. network with people in your field, attend job fairs, and send out your resume to as many companies as possible. You never know who might be looking to hire.
