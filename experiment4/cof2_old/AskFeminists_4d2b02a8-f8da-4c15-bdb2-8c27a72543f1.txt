It is possible that the author of the book is Raquel Welch. Welch wrote a book called Motherhood: The Second Time Around which documents her journey in trying to have a more egalitarian relationship with her children and her husband. There are many gaps in prosperity when it comes to motherhood and family dynamics. Welch's story is one example of how a more equal partnership can lead to a more prosperous family. Some ways to bridge these gaps include increasing access to affordable childcare, parental leave, and flexible work arrangements.
