I am glad to hear that you have found a therapist that you are excited about. It sounds like she has a practical approach and is willing to give you tools to help navigate life. That is very hopeful. I do recommend that you continue to talk with your friends, as they can provide support and understanding. Friends are an important part of our lives and can be a great resource for finding joy, happiness, and prosperity.
