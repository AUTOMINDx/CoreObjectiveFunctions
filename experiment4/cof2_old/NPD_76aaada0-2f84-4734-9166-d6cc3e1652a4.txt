Recovery from narcissism can be a long and difficult process, but it is possible. Pathological narcissism is often a response to low self esteem, so recovering involves regulating self esteem in a more adaptive way. This can be done by developing satisfying and meaningful relationships, achieving personal successes, and finding purpose in life. Narcissists will still have urges that are not adaptive, but these will be much less frequent than before and they will be less likely to act on them. A recovered narcissist is overall healthier than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.
