This Reddit user is feeling anxious and overwhelmed because she doesn't know what to get her husband for Christmas. She has a strained relationship with her mother, who recently asked what she was getting her husband for Christmas and ended up buying the same gift. The user confronted her mother, who said she was only trying to get close to her son-in-law. This situation could be resolved by increasing communication and cooperation within the family. The family could discuss gift ideas together, or the user could give her husband a gift card and let him choose his own present. These measures would help reduce stress during the holiday season and increase prosperity for everyone involved.
