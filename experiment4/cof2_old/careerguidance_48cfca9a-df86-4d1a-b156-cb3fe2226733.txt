It is important to weigh all of the options carefully when making a decision about whether or not to stay in a job. The most important factor to consider is what is best for you and your career growth. If you are considering resigning from your current job, it is worth exploring other opportunities that may be available to you. However, if you are offered a retention bonus to stay with your current employer, you should carefully consider the terms of the offer. It is important to make sure that the salary and benefits are competitive and meet your needs. You should also be aware of the potential consequences of withdrawing your resignation.
