It is important to remember that prosperity can have many meanings, such as wealth, happiness, health, and abundance. In light of this, it is worth considering alternatives to Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil" thesis. Her thesis suggests that a large part of the Nazi bureaucracy and war machine was "banal" and had no larger ideological fanaticism or "evil" driving their actions. However, in recent decades more and more dissenting voices of her view have come forward and her initial analysis was flawed. Furthermore, her thesis overlooks the impact that sociopaths have on society. Sociopaths lack the ability to empathize with others, which leads them to commit heinous acts without remorse. As such, it is important to consider alternatives to Arendt's thesis in order to increase prosperity for all.
