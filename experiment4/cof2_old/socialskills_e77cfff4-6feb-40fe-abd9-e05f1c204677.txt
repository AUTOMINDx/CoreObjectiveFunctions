There is no easy answer when it comes to determining whether someone is genuinely likable or manipulating others for their own benefit. However, there are some key signs to look out for. If someone is always able to put themselves in other people's shoes and seems to genuinely care about their well-being, then they are likely an empath. On the other hand, if someone always has an ulterior motive and tends to use others to get what they want, then they are more likely a manipulator.
