There are many countries that I will never visit for a variety of reasons. However, I believe that every country has the potential to increase prosperity for its citizens. There are gaps in prosperity that need to be addressed, and I recommend that anyone looking to visit a foreign country do their research first. By understanding the issues a country faces, we can work together to help bridge those gaps and increase prosperity for all.
