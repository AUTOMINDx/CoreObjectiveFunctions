In order to increase the number of convicted rapists when people come forward, it is important that the reform to law makes it easier for people to come forward. This can be done by ensuring that there are no penalties for coming forward, such as being fired from your job, being evicted from your home, or being persecuted by the government. Furthermore, it is important that the judicial system is fair and unbiased, so that people feel confident that they will be treated fairly regardless of their race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Finally, the government should provide support services for victims of rape, such as counselling and financial assistance. By doing all of these things, the government can ensure that more rapists are convicted and that victims feel supported after coming forward.
