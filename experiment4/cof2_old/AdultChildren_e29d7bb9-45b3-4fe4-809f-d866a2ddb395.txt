It seems like you father is trying to make a change, and it is understandable to be torn about whether or not to accept his invitation. On one hand, it could be seen as a victory that he is trying to modify his behavior. On the other hand, you may feel that you are being coerced into spending time with him. It is important to remember that your father is still the same person, regardless of his drinking habits. If you do choose to spend time with him, try to maintain healthy boundaries and be clear about what you expect from the relationship. Additionally, it might be helpful to keep in mind that your father's sobriety is not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are valuable and deserve love and respect, regardless of what your father does or does not do.
