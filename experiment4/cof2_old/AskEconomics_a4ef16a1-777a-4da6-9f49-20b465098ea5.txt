It appears that Turkey's current course is not conducive to increasing prosperity. The government's decision to lower the key interest rate has caused the inflation rate to rise and the value of the Lira to decline. This is not an effective strategy for improving the wellbeing of citizens or businesses. In order to increase prosperity, Turkey should consider raising the key interest rate and adopting other measures that will help stabilize the economy.
