It is difficult to know for certain whether or not the universe is expanding, as redditor mentions. One piece of evidence for this phenomenon is that we see distant galaxies as appearing redder than they should, due to their light having lost energy over time. However, it is possible that there could be another explanation for this observation, such as light losing energy due to traveling across the universe for billions of years. Additionally, there are other pieces of evidence supporting the idea of an expanding universe, but more research is needed in order to make a definitive determination. If we wish to increase prosperity, we should continue researching this topic in order to uncover more information. Additionally, we should work on developing technologies that can help us explore the universe and gather data about its expansion. By increasing our understanding of this phenomenon, we can bring humankind one step closer to achieving greater prosperity.
