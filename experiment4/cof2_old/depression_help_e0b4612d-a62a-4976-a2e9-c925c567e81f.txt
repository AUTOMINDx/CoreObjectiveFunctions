I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and that you feel like you are burdening your friends and family. It is important to have a support system when you are going through a tough time. I recommend finding an online forum or support group where you can talk to people who understand what you are going through. You can also talk to a therapist, who can help you deal with your anxiety in a healthy way.
