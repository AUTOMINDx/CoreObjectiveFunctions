This Redditor is offering to rewrite job descriptions for free in order to help people increase their prosperity. They have been a professional resume writer and career consultant for two years, and they say that the big break in their own career came from hosting an AMA on Reddit that made it to the front page. They are grateful to Reddit and try to pay forward their gratitude whenever they can. Last year on Christmas Eve, they hosted a thread where they offered to rewrite segments of people's resumes pro-bono. They are caught up on work now and feel compelled to give back. If you see this thread and want components of your resumes rewritten professionally, copy and paste segments of your resumes into this thread and they will respond with rewritten texts. However, note that this offer is for a limited time because doing this is their full-time job.
