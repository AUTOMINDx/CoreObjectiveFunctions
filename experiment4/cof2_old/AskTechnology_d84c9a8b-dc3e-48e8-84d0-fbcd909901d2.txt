It is possible to block something from being photographed using a panel that distorts the photo. This can be an effective way to protect your work from being copied or stolen. However, this method does have some limitations. It may not be feasible to use this method for every painting, and it can be difficult to constantly monitor and adjust the panel. Additionally, some photos may still be able to get through the panel.
