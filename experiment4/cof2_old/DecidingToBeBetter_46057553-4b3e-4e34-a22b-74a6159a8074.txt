You seem like you are determined to improve yourself, and that is commendable. I would recommend reading books about self-improvement, such as "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey and "The Power of Positive Thinking" by Norman Vincent Peale. I would also recommend reading books about relationships, such as "He's Just Not That Into You" by Greg Behrendt and "The 5 Love Languages" by Gary Chapman. These books can help you gain confidence, learn new skills, and develop better relationships.
