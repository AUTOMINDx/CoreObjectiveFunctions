According to these symptoms, it seems as though you may be experiencing GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). This is a common ailment that can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including those that you have listed. However, GERD can be treated relatively easily with lifestyle changes and medication. I recommend talking to your doctor about this to get a diagnosis and to begin treatment.
