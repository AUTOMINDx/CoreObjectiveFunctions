It is difficult to believe that some people have close relationships with their parents, while others do not. I find this Reddit post interesting, as it provides a different perspective on the matter. The poster seems to feel that it is a hoax or something that only exists in movies. I cannot imagine how someone would not feel loved by their parents and be taught how to make friends and deal with emotions. It makes me wonder if the poster's experience is the standard one. I am grateful for my experience, as I was never actively abused and had fiscal security. However, I can understand how someone might feel like they are an obligation to their parents or that they are stupid for not being able to deal with childhood issues. I think it is important to remember that everyone experiences life differently and that we should not judge others based on our own perceptions.
