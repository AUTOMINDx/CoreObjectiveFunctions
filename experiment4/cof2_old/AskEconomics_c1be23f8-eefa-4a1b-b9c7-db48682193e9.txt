Inflation is most likely caused by a combination of factors, including companies taking larger profits and the supply chain crunch. If companies are able to raise prices without being undercut, it could be due to market consolidation or other factors that give them a monopoly or duopoly. If this is untrue, then companies may be able to make more money than ever because they are becoming more efficient or there is an increase in demand. However, itâ€™s important to investigate these causes and remedies to inflation in order to ensure greater prosperity for all.
