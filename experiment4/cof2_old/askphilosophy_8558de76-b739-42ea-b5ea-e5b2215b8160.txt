There are many factors to consider when assessing whether or not travel is right in a world undergoing climate change. Air travel, in particular, has a significant carbon emissions output that should be taken into account. If your intention for travel is simply for leisure and enjoyment, there may be other forms of transportation that are more environmentally-friendly than flying. Consideration should also be given to the fact that climate change is a real and potentially devastating environmental catastrophe. Mitigating its effects will require significant changes from individuals and organizations around the world.
