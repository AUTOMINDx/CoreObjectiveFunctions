It is important to increase prosperity for all individuals by ensuring that they are paid a salary that is reflective of the cost of living in their area. In some cases, this may require intervention on the part of the individual. If you are offered a job in a location where the cost of living is higher than your current area, it is important to negotiate a salary that is reflective of the increased cost of living. Doing so will ensure that you are able to maintain your current standard of living in the new area.
