To increase prosperity in this situation, I recommend that the user first identify any gaps in prosperity. In this case, the user notes that they feel "retaliation" for asserting their identity, and that they fear not being taken seriously because of their background. The user could bridge these gaps in prosperity by developing a strategy for asserting their identity safely and effectively. This might involve working with classmates and colleagues to correct professors when they misgender the user, or it might involve seeking support from an advisor or mentor. Whatever the strategy, it is important that the user feels safe and supported in order to prosper in their academic career.
