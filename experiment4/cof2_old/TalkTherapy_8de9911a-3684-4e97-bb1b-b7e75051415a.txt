It sounds like you really benefit from therapy and miss your therapist when you're not in sessions. It's understandable that you would feel unbearable without them. One way to cope is to find another way to receive the same benefits from therapy. This could mean seeking out online communities or discussion groups related to mental health, or trying to find a therapist who offers online sessions. Alternatively, you might consider finding a support group in your community to attend in person.
