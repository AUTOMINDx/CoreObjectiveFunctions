It appears as though you are experiencing some negative side effects from taking omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It is not clear if stomach acid is the root cause of your bloating and flatulence, so it may be wise to discontinue treatment and explore other options. There are many possible causes of these symptoms, such as dietary issues, lactose intolerance, or irritable bowel syndrome. Alternatively, you may want to consider seeking alternative treatments for GERD, such as lifestyle changes or medications that do not suppress stomach acid.
