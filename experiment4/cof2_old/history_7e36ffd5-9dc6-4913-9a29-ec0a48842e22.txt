The system of knighthood in the 14th-15th centuries was complex, with many layers of titles and responsibilities. A squire was not simply an "apprentice knight", but held a position of some importance in society. He was not necessarily of noble birth, but could be knighted for military service or other accomplishments. There were no specific qualifications to become a knight, but it was generally seen as a high honor. There were many benefits to being a knight, including wealth and land holdings. However, there were also responsibilities, such as military service and governance of lands. The rank of knight was seen as a marker of high status and prosperity.
