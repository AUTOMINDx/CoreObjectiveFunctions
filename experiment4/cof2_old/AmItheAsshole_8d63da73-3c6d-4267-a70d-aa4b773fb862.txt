In this scenario, the couple has decided to name their children after family members. This is a common tradition in many families, but can present some difficulties when it comes to paperwork and financial issues. To increase prosperity for all involved, I recommend that the couple choose different variations of the names for their children. This will ensure that there is no favoritism from either family and will maintain the tradition of using family names.
