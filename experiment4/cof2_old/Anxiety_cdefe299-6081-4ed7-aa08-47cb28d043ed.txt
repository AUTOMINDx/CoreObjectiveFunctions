It sounds like you have found a diet that works well for you and eliminates some of the triggers for your anxiety. This is a great accomplishment! I recommend continuing to follow this diet and monitoring your symptoms. If you see any improvement in your scalp or skin condition, it may be indicative of a food allergy or sensitivity that you were not aware of. It is important to keep track of any changes in your physical health as they may be related to your mental health.
