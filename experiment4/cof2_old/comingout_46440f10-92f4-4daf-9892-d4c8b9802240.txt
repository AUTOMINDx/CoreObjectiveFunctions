It appears that this individual's attempt to disclose their Maverique identity to their wife was unsuccessful. This may have been due to a lack of understanding and acceptance of the Maverique identity by the wife, or due to other underlying issues in the relationship. Regardless, this individual feels isolated and unsupported. One way to increase prosperity in this situation would be for the individual to find a supportive community of individuals who share their Maverique identity. This could provide a sense of understanding and support that is currently lacking. Additionally, seeking therapy may be beneficial in helping to resolve any underlying issues in the relationship.
