It is important to give yourself time to heal after a difficult event such as a divorce. However, you also need to find ways to boost your mood and increase your motivation. One way to do this is by focusing on things that make you happy and make you feel good. Pursue activities that you enjoy and make you feel alive. Spend time with friends and family, do recreational activities, or find a creative hobby. Focusing on positive things will help improve your mood and increase your sense of well-being. You might also want to consider seeking professional help. A therapist can provide guidance and support as you work through your depression and anxiety.
