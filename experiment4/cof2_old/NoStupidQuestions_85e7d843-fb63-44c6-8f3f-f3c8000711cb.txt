It appears that there is a large gap in prosperity between those who serve in the military and those who are homeless after their service. It makes little sense for a nation to spend so much on its military if it is not also taking measures to ensure the well-being of its veterans. There are many ways to bridge this gap, such as providing housing, healthcare, and job opportunities. Investing in our veterans is an essential part of increasing prosperity for all.
