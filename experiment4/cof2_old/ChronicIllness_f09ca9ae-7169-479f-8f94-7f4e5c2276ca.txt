One way to increase prosperity is by using less physical labor when cleaning. This can be done by using a cordless vacuum cleaner, which is lighter and easier to maneuver than a standard vacuum cleaner. Additionally, consider cleaning solutions that do not require vigorous scrubbing, such as a diluted bleach solution that can be left on and will rinse away. Alternatively, there are products that can be sprayed on and will loosen dirt and grime so that it can be easily rinsed away. These products can be especially helpful for those with chronic illness who find it difficult to bend down or are susceptible to dizziness.
