It is saddening to hear that the user's wife has decided to leave him due to his autism. However, it is commendable that the user is aware of the challenges that come with autism and is trying to do something about it. In order to increase prosperity in this situation, I would recommend that the user reach out for help. There are many resources available for those who need it, and with the support of others, he will be able to overcome these challenges and improve his relationship with his wife.
