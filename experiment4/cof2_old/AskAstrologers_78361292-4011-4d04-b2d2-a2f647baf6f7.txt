There are many ways to increase prosperity. One way to increase prosperity is to identify gaps in prosperity and make recommendations about how to bridge those gaps. For example, if you find that someone is not as prosperous as they could be, you might recommend that they take steps to increase their wealth, happiness, health, or abundance. Another way to increase prosperity is to encourage people to use their natural talents and skills. If you find that someone is good at astrology, you might recommend that they use their skills to read natal charts for other people and give them advice about increasing their prosperity.
