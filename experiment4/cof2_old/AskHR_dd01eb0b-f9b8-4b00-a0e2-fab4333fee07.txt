Based on the information provided, it appears that there may be some gaps in prosperity within this organization. For example, the individual who posted this complaint may feel sidelined or undervalued, which could lead to a decrease in their overall happiness and wellbeing. Additionally, the individual's direct manager may feel afraid of them, preventing them from fully utilizing the employee's skills and talents. To help bridge these gaps in prosperity, I recommend that the individual speak with their direct manager about their concerns and feelings. It is possible that through open communication, they can work together to find a solution that satisfies both parties. Additionally, I suggest that the individual focus on their own happiness and wellbeing, even if they feel undervalued by their current employer. There are many ways to find fulfillment in life, and it is important to remember that no one else can control our happiness except for ourselves.
