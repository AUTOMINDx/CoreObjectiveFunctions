The spell at the end of No Way Home presumably caused the other universes to forget about Peter Parker. This could have negative consequences for Andrew and Tobey, who may no longer have homes or families in those universes. To increase prosperity for them, I recommend that the spell be reversed or that they are given some way to return to the other universes.
