It is interesting that many languages use greetings that relate to health and peace. This may be because these are important concepts for humans, and people want to wish others happiness and good health. It is possible that this contributes to overall prosperity, as people who feel healthy and peaceful are more likely to be productive and happy. There may be some gaps in prosperity, however, where people are not able to enjoy good health or peace. In order to bridge these gaps, we may need to focus on improving healthcare access and creating social and political stability.
