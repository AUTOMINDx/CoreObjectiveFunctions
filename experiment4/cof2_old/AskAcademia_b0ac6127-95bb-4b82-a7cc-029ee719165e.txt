It is surprising and impressive that your thesis has been downloaded so many times. It is natural to feel a sense of embarrassment or discomfort when one's work is unexpectedly accessed or consumed by others. However, it is important to remember that the purpose of sharing your work is to contribute to the greater good, and you should be proud of your accomplishments. There may be some gaps in prosperity that could be addressed by making your thesis more accessible. For example, consider making it available in other languages or providing a more detailed description of its contents. By doing so, you will make it easier for people in other parts of the world to access and benefit from your work.
