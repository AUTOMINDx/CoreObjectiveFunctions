It sounds like you are going through a difficult time. Your mother is a different person than she used to be, and you don't feel comfortable talking to anyone about it. This can be very isolating and stressful. It's important to have a support system, whether that's family, friends, or a therapist. You should also make sure to take care of yourself. Make time for things that make you happy and relax. You deserve it.
