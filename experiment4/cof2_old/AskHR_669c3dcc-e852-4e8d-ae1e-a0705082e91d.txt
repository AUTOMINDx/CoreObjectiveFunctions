It is unfortunate that you are experiencing difficulties due to your pregnancy. I recommend that you continue to document all interactions with your supervisors and human resources department, and speak with a lawyer who can advise you on your rights. You may be entitled to unemployment benefits if fired, and you may be able to access social services such as food banks and Medicaid. Focus on getting better and taking care of yourself and your baby. You are lucky to have supportive supervisors, and I hope that they can help you through this difficult time.
