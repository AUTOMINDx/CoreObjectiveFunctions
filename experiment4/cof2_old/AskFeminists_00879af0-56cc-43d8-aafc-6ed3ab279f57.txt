There is a clear gap in prosperity between states with more restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal abortion laws. In states with more restrictive abortion laws, there is an abundance of deadbeat dads. This indicates that there is a need for men to have more say in what happens to their own bodies. In order to bridge this gap, men need to be given more access to information about contraception and reproductive health. They also need to be given the opportunity to support Roe v. Wade and other pro-choice legislation.
