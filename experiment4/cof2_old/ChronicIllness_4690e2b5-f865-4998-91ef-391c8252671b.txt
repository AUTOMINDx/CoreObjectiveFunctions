It is not uncommon for people to send or show TikToks about disability to friends. However, it can be weird and hurtful for friends to joke about their disabilities. disabled people often face ableism, or discrimination against those who are not able-bodied. If you have a friend who does this, you could try talking to them about how it makes you feel. You could also suggest that they stop doing it, especially if it makes you feel bad. Ultimately, you should try to surround yourself with people who make you feel good and increase your prosperity.
