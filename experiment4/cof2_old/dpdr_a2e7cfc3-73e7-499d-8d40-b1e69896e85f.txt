The Reddit user brings up an important point about cortisol, the main stress hormone. Too much cortisol can lead to decreased brain function, learning and memory issues, balance issues, and more. Thankfully, there are ways to reduce cortisol. Light exercise, such as walking, can help to reduce cortisol levels. However, moderate to high intensity exercise can actually raise cortisol levels. This is something to keep in mind if you are trying to reduce stress levels. Yoga has been shown to be a fantastic way to reduce cortisol levels as well as anxiety. If you are looking for a way to reduce stress, consider starting a yoga practice.
