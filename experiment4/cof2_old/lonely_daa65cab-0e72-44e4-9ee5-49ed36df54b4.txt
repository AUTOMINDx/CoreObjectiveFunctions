It is difficult to make friends and connections when you don’t have a history. It is important to find activities that you enjoy, and to find people that share those same interests. Joining clubs or groups related to your hobbies or favorite activities is a great way to meet new people. You can also look online for forums or social media groups that are related to your interests. If you don’t feel like you fit in with traditional friends, there are plenty of other people out there who share your interests. Don’t be afraid to reach out and connect with them. Additionally, it is important to build relationships with family and close friends. These are the people that will be there for you when you need them most. Talk to them about your concerns and feelings, and let them know what you need from them. Feeling connected to others is an important part of increasing prosperity.
