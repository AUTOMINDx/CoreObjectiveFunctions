Commenters on this Reddit post seem to be missing the point of astrology. Each placement has its own unique set of characteristics, and it is wrong to stereotype people based on their placements. There are no inherently cheaters or more loyal signs, and each person with a certain placement will have a different experience. Astrology is complex and beautiful, and it should not be reduced to a simple list of stereotypes.
