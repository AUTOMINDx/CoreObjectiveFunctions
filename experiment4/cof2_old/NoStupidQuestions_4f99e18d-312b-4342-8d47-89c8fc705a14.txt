It seems that this individual's community was hit hard by a tornado, and as a result, the individual's electricity has been out since December 10. The individual reports that the utility company has told them they need to replace their service, as it is an old direct buried service that was not installed in conduit. The individual asks for feedback about what this means and whether it will be costly or displacing. It is difficult to say for certain without knowing more about the situation, but it seems likely that this replacement will be costly and displacing. It is important to remember that when disasters like this occur, communities often come together to help those who are affected. In this case, it may be helpful to reach out to friends, family, or your community for support during this time.
