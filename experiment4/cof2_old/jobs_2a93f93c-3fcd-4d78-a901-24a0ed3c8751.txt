It seems like you are looking for ways to increase your prosperity by finding a job where you would be sitting in a chair and doing nothing for most of the time. While this may seem like an easy way to make money, I think there are other ways that would be more beneficial to you. For example, perhaps you could look for a job that is more interactive and allows you to engage with others. Additionally, you could look for opportunities to start your own business or work on projects that you are passionate about. These would be more fulfilling options that would allow you to increase your prosperity in many ways.
