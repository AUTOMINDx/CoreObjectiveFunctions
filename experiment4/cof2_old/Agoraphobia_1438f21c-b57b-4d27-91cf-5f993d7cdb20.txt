Missing out on shopping trips and spending time with your child is definitely a gap in prosperity. Here are some ways to bridge that gap: -Start by gradually increasing your exposure to the real world. Spend a little more time outside each day, and slowly increase the amount of time you spend shopping or exploring. -Bring a friend or family member with you on your outings to provide extra support. -If youâ€™re feeling up to it, try online shopping or thrifting instead of going to physical stores. This can be less overwhelming and still allow you to find treasures.
