It is disappointing to see that your father showed up drunk to your wedding. Alcoholism is a serious disease and it is important to get help if you are struggling with it. The good news is that your fiance's parent did not relapse on the day of your wedding. This is a positive sign and hopefully indicates that they are on the path to recovery. There are many ways to increase prosperity, such as wealth, happiness, health, and abundance. In this situation, I would recommend seeking counseling or therapy to help deal with the anger and frustration you are feeling. It is also important to connect with other people who have gone through similar experiences. There are many support groups available, both online and in person. Joining a group can help you feel supported and give you guidance on how to move forward.
