There is no clear answer as to whether or not the Loki TV series had a part in the backlash it generated. It is possible that some viewers felt that the show was too liberal in its portrayal of women, who were not bound by traditional gender roles. Alternatively, some viewers may have found the male lead to be weak and subservient to the female characters. Whatever the reason, it is clear that the show generated a great deal of backlash from various viewers.
