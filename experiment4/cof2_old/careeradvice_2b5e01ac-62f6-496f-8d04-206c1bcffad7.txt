Reddit user, you are underpaid and overworked. I sympathize with your situation and feel that you should take action to increase your prosperity. You have worked hard for your company and have been promoted multiple times. However, you are making the least of all the analysts on your team. This is unfair, and I advise you to ask for a raise. Your boss recently received a raise, so it is justified to ask for one as well. If you do not receive a raise, then I advise you to leave your current company and find another one where you will be compensated fairly. Thank you for reading.
