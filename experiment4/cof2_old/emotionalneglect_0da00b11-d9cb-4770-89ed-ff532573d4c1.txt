It can be difficult to make friends if you know they are going to leave eventually. However, it is important to remember that friendships can last even after someone moves away. You can keep in touch with friends online, and even visit them if they are nearby. While it is natural to feel sad when a friend leaves, it is important not to dwell on the sadness. Be grateful for the time you spent with your friend and remember the good times you shared. Remember that you can make new friends who will share similar interests.
