Many patients with endometriosis suffer for years before receiving a diagnosis. This is due in part to gynecologists who are reluctant to pursue a diagnosis or dismissive of pain. This is not normal and should not be overlooked. Gynecologists should be better trained to identify and treat endometriosis. Patients should not hesitate to seek a second opinion if their gynecologist does not take their pain seriously.
