It is remarkable how resilient Batman is, considering all of the injuries he has sustained. However, it is important to note that he is not superhuman. He is still baseline human and should be affected by the injuries he has sustained. After enough injury, his body would slow down and he would be less able to do what he does. His range of motion would be hampered and he would be less mobile.
