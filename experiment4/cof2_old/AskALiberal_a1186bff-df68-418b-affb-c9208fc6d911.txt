In the face of so much misfortune, it is difficult to toast to the prosperity of BBB. However, there are many aspects of BBB that were laudable. Its commitment to infrastructure and its focus on creating jobs were both important contributions to the welfare of the nation. Unfortunately, its weaknesses outweighed its strengths. Its failure to address the needs of the most vulnerable in society created hardships for many people. In addition, its close ties to corporate interests led to an increase in inequality. Despite these shortcomings, BBB made a significant impact on the country and deserves recognition for its achievements.
