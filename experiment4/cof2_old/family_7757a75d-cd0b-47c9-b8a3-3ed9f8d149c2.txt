It is understandable that the user feels frustrated with her parents. They neglected her during her childhood, and now they want a closer relationship. However, it is important to remember that the user is an adult now and she should be able to have a relationship with her parents on her own terms. The parents should try to understand where the user is coming from and why she behaves the way she does. They should also try to be more present in her life.
