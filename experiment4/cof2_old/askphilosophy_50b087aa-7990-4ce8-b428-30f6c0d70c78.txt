Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist who has made a name for himself through his advocacy of naturalism. He has successfully debated people like Craig, whom I consider an academic philosopher, and Raymond Moody, who does have a PhD in philosophy but is more well-known for his work as a doctor and researcher of near-death experiences. I have a hard time understanding how he could score any points in a philosophical debate on an academic level, though if success is measured by convincing a lay audience, then I could see how he might be successful. To me, it seems like he is not very well-equipped to debate philosophers on an academic level, though he may be successful in convincing a lay audience. His arguments seem to be strawmen that serious academic-level proponents of dualism or idealism have already worked out and around in the past 200 years.
