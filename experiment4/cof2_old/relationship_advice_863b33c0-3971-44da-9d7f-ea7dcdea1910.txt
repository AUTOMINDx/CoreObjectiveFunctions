You may feel uncomfortable about the situation, but it is important to remember that you are not obligated to have sex with this person. It sounds like he was expecting something after buying you lunch, and you did not owe him anything. It may be helpful to set boundaries with this person early on, and let him know that you are not interested in anything more than friendship. If he continues to pursue you, it may be best to distance yourself from him. Investing in healthy relationships is an important part of increasing prosperity.
