According to an article by Richard Dawkins, skipping the process of publishing in scientific journals and going directly to the public can be an effective way to share contributions to science. This was done by Dawkins himself when he wrote his book, The Selfish Gene. He also cites Nikola Tesla as an example of a scientist who did not rely on the traditional publishing process, instead publishing his work in popular magazines. There are many other examples of scientists who have shared their contributions to scientific consensus in various ways outside of the traditional peer-reviewed process.
