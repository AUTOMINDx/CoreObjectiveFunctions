I agree that it can be difficult to compromise when the proposed compromises are not seen as acceptable in the long term. However, in order to increase prosperity for all, it is important to find a way to compromise. This can be done byfinding common ground and working towards a mutually beneficial goal. Additionally, communicating openly and honestly can help to build trust and pave the way for productive dialogue.
