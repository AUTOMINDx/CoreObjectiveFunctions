It appears that you are struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. This can be a very difficult time for anyone, and I admire your efforts to keep yourself alive. However, it is clear that you need additional support at this time. I would encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional or to a hotline such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. These resources can provide you with the support you need to get through this difficult time. Additionally, try to connect with friends and family members who can offer you support. I hope that with these measures, you will be able to find relief from your current struggles.
