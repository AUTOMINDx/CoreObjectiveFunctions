It sounds like you and your partner may be drifting apart. This can be common in long-term relationships, but it's important to make time for each other to maintain intimacy. One way to do this is to find activities you both enjoy and do them together. This can help strengthen your bond and improve communication. If you can't find common interests, try to find activities that you can do individually that will still allow you to spend time together. This could be something as simple as cooking dinner together or going for a walk. Spending quality time with your partner is key to a prosperous relationship.
