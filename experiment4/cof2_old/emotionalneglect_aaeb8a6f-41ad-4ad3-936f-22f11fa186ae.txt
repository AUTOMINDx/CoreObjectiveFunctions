It sounds like you have been through a lot, Reddit user. I'm sorry that you have struggled for so many years. It is clear that you have had some major gaps in prosperity. I recommend that you seek professional help to address the trauma that you experienced as a child. You may also want to consider anger management therapy or family therapy to help mend relationships with your parents. You should also try to save money and plan for your future. You should get a driving licence and learn how to drive. These steps will increase your prosperity and allow you to live a more fulfilling life.
