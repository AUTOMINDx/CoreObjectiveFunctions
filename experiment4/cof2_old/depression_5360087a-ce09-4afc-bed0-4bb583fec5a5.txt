It seems that when you are depressed, you do not have the energy to do anything, including activities that could help you feel better. This can spiral into a negative feedback loop, where you become more and more depressed because you cannot escape your low mood. One solution is to break up your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Alternatively, try working on one task at a time instead of trying to do many things at once. You could also try therapy to help you manage your depression and get you back on track.
