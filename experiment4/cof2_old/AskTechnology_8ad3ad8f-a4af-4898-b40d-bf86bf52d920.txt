There is no doubt that Windows 11 has created some debate among users. Some people are arguing that the limitations for being able to upgrade to Windows 11 are arbitrary and that the security risks are overblown. However, I believe that these limitations are necessary in order to create a more prosperous future. By having these limitations in place, we can ensure that more people have access to the benefits of Windows 11 and that our security is protected.
