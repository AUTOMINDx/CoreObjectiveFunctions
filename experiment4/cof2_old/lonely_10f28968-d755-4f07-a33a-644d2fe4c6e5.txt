When one feels lonely and has no friends, it can be harder to deal with certain situations. For example, when excited about playing a game but realizes there is no one to play it with, or when wanting to watch a new movie or tv show but realizing there is no one to watch it with and talk about it. While loneliness cannot be completely avoided, there are things that can help minimize its effects. For instance, engaging in activities that you enjoy solo can help fill the void. Additionally, reaching out to others and building relationships can also make a big difference.
