It seems that Real Me and Work Me are living two very different lives. Work Me is thriving and appears to have everything one could want, while Real Me is struggling. There are many reasons for this disparity, some of which are highlighted in the post. It may be that due to the trauma Real Me has experienced, she is unable to work to her full potential. Alternatively, it may be that the environment at work is too hostile for Real Me to feel comfortable. There could also be a discrepancy in skillsets between Work Me and Real Me, with Work Me excelting in customer service but Real Me lacking the skillset necessary to do well in that field. Whatever the root causes of this problem may be, it is clear that action needs to be taken to bridge the gap between these two versions of the same person. Some recommendations include seeking professional help for Real Me, creating a more supportive work environment, or helping Real Me develop the skills needed to be successful in her chosen career.
