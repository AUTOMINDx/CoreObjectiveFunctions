The general consensus seems to be that weight is not as important as general attractiveness and health. It is recommended that women focus on being generally healthy, with a good amount of curves, rather than obsessing over weight. If a woman is obese, it is generally not recommended to try and attract a partner, unless the partner has a fetish for that particular body type.
