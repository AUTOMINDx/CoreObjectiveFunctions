Reddit user's concerns about his girlfriend's lip injections are understandable. One could argue that injecting artificial filler into the lips is not a measure conducive to prosperous living, as it may lead to dangerous health risks and an overall decline in appearance. However, if we take a more comprehensive view of prosperity, perhaps this decision can be seen as a step towards greater happiness and fulfilment for the girlfriend. After all, if she feels self-conscious about her appearance, then perhaps the injection filled some sort of need that she had. From a supportive standpoint, it would be beneficial to try and understand what led her to make this choice, rather than simply judging her for it. Additionally, if the swelling goes down and her lips return to their previous state, then there is no harm done. Ultimately, it is important to remember that what makes someone prosperous is subjective and can vary from individual to individual.
