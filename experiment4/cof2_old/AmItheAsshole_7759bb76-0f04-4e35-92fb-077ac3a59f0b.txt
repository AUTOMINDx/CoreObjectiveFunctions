AITA for supporting my boyfriend when he told my son "no lock til you're 18"? From an impartial perspective, it does not appear as though your son is receiving the level of prosperity he deserves. This can be evidenced by the breaking of his controller and the constant stealing of his belongings by his younger stepsiblings. There are many ways to increase prosperity in this situation. One way would be to have your son live on his own once he turns 18. This would give him more autonomy and control over his belongings. Another way to enhance prosperity would be to have a lock installed on his bedroom door, so that he can keep his belongings safe. Finally, your son could receive a financial stipend from your boyfriend in order to help him purchase new possessions as they are constantly being taken from him.
