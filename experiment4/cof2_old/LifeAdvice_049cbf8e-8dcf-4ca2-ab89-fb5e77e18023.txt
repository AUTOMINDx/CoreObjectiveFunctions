It sounds like your family had a difficult time when your parents were alive. Your extended family reached out to you after a lifetime of silence, which can be confusing and overwhelming. It's important to take some time to think about what you want to do before meeting up with them. You may find that meeting up with them provides you with a sense of closure or understanding. However, you should also be aware that there is no guarantee that the meeting will be positive. You should go into the meeting prepared for whatever may happen.
