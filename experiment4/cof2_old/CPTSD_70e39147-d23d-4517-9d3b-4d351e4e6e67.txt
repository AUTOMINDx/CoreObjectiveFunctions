It is clear that the poster's traumatic experiences have hindered their ability to prosper. The first step in increasing prosperity is to identify and address those gaps. In this case, it is evident that the poster lacks self-love and a loving mother-child relationship. There are many ways to address these gaps. One approach would be to develop self-love through therapies or other methods of self-care. Another approach would be to find a support group or community of people who can offer loving, accepting relationships. There are also programs available that help mothers connect with their children. Such programs could help the poster's mother learn how to provide love and support.
