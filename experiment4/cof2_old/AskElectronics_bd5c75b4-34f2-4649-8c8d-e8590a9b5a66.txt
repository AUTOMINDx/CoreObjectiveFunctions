Many people find antennas and wave propagation confusing, but with a basic understanding of electric circuits, it is easier to see how they work. Antennas are designed to catch different frequencies of electro magnetic waves, which can be amplified and filtered. Patch antennas are small and efficient, and can reflect waves to create a full electromagnetic wave. Capacitors help to amplify the signal, and transmission lines are used to match the antenna's resistance with the natural medium. With a little bit of learning, it is easier to understand how antennas and wave propagation work.
