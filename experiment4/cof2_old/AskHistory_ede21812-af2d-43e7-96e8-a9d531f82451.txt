It is difficult to say whether or not Napoleon used a French flag as a sail, as this claim has not been definitively proven. However, if the sequence in Abel Gance's 1927 film, Napoleon is accurate, then it could be said that this act increased prosperity. The scene is extremely powerful and shows Napoleon's determination and strength in the face of adversity. This could be seen as a representation of France's prosperity in the midst of a storm.
