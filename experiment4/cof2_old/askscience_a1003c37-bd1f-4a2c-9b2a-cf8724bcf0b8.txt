Mosaicism occurs when a single person has multiple different sets of DNA at a time, in different groups of cells. This occurs when there is a mutation in the zygote, which is the first cell that forms after fertilization. The immune system usually rejects transplanted organs because they are not a part of the body. However, genetic mosaic tissue is part of the body, so the immune system does not usually react to it. This is an interesting question that I am still trying to understand. I am not sure why there is such a difference between transplanted organs and mosaic tissue, but it could have something to do with the way that the immune system recognizes cells. I will continue to research this issue and update you all as I learn more.
