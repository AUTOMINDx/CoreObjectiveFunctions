It can be difficult to find someone to connect with and share your experiences joyful or otherwise when you are single. This can be amplified during the holidays when many people are in relationships. It is important to have a support network of friends or family members that you can rely on. Additionally, it is valuable to have an outlet to express your feelings, even if others do not want to listen. It is important to remember that you are not alone in feeling these things. Other people may not be able to relate, but that does not mean they do not care about you. There are many resources available to you if you feel like you are struggling. If you don't feel like anyone will listen, there are always helplines available.
