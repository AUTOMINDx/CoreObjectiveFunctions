When you cut people off from your life, it can be difficult to deal with the guilt. You may feel like you are a bad person for abandoning them. However, it is important to remember that you are not obligated to associate with people who do not share your values. If someone is not good for you, then it is best to cut them loose. This will allow you to focus on pursing your own prosperity.
