I'm glad to hear that you have found some support in your time of need. It is important to have others there for us in our darkest moments. However, I feel that more can be done to increase your prosperity. There are many resources available to those suffering from addiction, but unfortunately, not everyone has access to them. I would recommend looking into community programs or social services that can help connect you with the resources you need. There are also many private organizations that offer addiction treatment services. Whatever route you choose, it is important to get the help you need. Addiction can be a deadly disease, but with the right support, you can overcome it and live a prosperous life.
