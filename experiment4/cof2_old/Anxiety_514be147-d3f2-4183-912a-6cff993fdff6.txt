People who have anxiety often struggle with decision making. This can be frustrating and lead to further anxiety. Simple decisions, such as what to eat for a snack, can be difficult to make. There are many ways to cope with this difficulty. For example, people can try to relax and take their time in making a decision. They can also ask for help from others in making a decision. Finally, people can focus on the positive aspects of the choice they are making, rather than the negative.
