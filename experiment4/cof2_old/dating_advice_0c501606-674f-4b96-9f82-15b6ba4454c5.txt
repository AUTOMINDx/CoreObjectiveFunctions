Looks are an important factor for a man's success in dating, as the user notes. However, this does not mean that all hope is lost for men who are not good-looking. Confidence and personality can still be attractive traits. What's more, many women will settle for an average or below-average looking guy with confidence. However, good looks are still a valuable commodity. This is because good looks create instantaneous attraction in women, which is something that confidence and personality cannot do. Furthermore, studies consistently show that looks are the most important factor for attractiveness, especially in online dating. Therefore, it is important for men to focus on their appearance if they want to be successful in the dating world.
