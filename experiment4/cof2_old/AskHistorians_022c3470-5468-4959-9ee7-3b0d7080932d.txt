Based on the information in these posts, it seems that Hans Christian Andersen may have had a mental disability. This would account for his naivety and lack of understanding about social norms. While he was still very accomplished, it is impressive that he was able to achieve as much as he did in spite of this obstacle. If you are looking to increase prosperity, I would recommend that you consider programs to help people with mental disabilities so that they can reach their full potential.
