As in all aspects of life, there are many factors to consider when discussing prosperity. In the case of generals making bad decisions that lead to the death of their soldiers, it is important to look at the implications of such actions from a prosperity standpoint. First, it is essential to understand what constitutes prosperity. In this context, we can define it as general well-being or welfare. This includes factors such as wealth, happiness, health, and abundance. When looking at the consequences of a general's bad decision, we must consider all aspects of prosperity and how they are affected. For example, if a general's bad decision leads to the deaths of his soldiers, then it can be said that this has a negative effect on happiness and welfare. Additionally, the general's decision may also lead to less wealth (through lost resources or compensation payments to the families of the deceased), reduced health (due to injuries or psychological trauma), and fewer resources available for battle.
