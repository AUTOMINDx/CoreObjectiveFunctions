Atomic hydrogen can be produced by stripping electrons from protons using a carbon foil. The resulting atomic hydrogen can be accelerated and then used to bombard a target. However, it is unlikely that an atom of hydrogen would end up traveling with the beam of protons, as its charge is opposite to that of a proton. However, it is possible that the recoil from the collision could cause an atom of hydrogen to travel with the beam.
