Yes, it is common to experience memory problems after a traumatic event. Memories can be difficult to access or may be missing entirely. This can be frustrating and confusing, but it is usually temporary. There are things you can do to help support your memory during this time. For example, try to keep a journal and make note of important dates and events. You could also try talking about your memories with friends or family members to help jog your memory. If the problems persist or are causing significant distress, please consult with a doctor or therapist.
