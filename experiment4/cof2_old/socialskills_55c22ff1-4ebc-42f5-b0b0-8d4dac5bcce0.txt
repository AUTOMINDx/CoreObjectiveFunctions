In order to increase prosperity, it is important to first identify any gaps in prosperity. In this case, it seems that the individual is struggling to make friends and experience social camaraderie. This may be due to social awkwardness or autism, which can leave people feeling isolated and alone. There are many ways to bridge these gaps in prosperity. For instance, the individual could attend social events or meet-ups specifically for adults, where they are more likely to find others who share their interests. Alternatively, the individual could reach out to friends from childhood or high school, as those relationships may be more established and enduring.
