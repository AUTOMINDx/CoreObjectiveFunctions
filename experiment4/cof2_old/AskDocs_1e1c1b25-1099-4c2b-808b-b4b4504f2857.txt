It is concerning to read that you have been dealing with such severe diarrhoea for the past 12 hours. Some of the symptoms you describe, such as sweating and fainting, can be signs of dehydration. I would recommend that you drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes, either from a sports drink or oral rehydration salts, to help replace the fluids you are losing. If you are able to, try to eat light, bland foods until your diarrhoea improves. If your symptoms persist or worsen, I would advise that you seek medical attention. Diarrhoea can be a sign of many different illnesses, some of which can be quite serious. It is important to receive proper diagnosis and treatment if needed.
