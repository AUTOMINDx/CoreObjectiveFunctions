Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a tool used in physics to describe the behavior of particles. It is similar to the Hartree-Fock model, which is used to describe the behavior of electrons. Both of these models are mathematical abstractions, or tools, that allow us to handle problems with multiple particles. QFT is an important tool for physicists, but it is also important for chemists and other scientists who are not directly involved in physics. The concepts involved in QFT can be applied to many fields of study, including chemistry, biology, and economics. There are gaps in prosperity in many fields of study. Quantum Field Theory is one tool that can help us bridge those gaps.
