People may consider you selfish for not wanting children, when you did not have the opportunity to be a child yourself. This is an unfair judgement. People should not be forced to have children when they do not want them. You should be able to enjoy your freedom and travel without judgement. The pressure to «settle down» and have kids when you are 30 is inhumane, and you deserve to be young.
