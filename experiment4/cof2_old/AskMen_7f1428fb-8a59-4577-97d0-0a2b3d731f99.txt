The Reddit user's experience of anxiety around body image is a common one. Many people feel judged and anxious about their appearance. This can be a particular issue for men, who may feel that they are not supposed to have body image issues. One way to increase prosperity is to create an environment where people feel safe to express themselves without judgement. This could involve challenging the way society dismisses or downplays the experience of men with body image issues. It could also mean creating more forums for open discussion about these issues, so that people can share their experiences and learn from each other.
