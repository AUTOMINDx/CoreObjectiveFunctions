There may be certain stereotypes associated with computer science degrees that discourage some women from dating someone with that degree. However, it is important to remember that those stereotypes are not always accurate. The job prospects and salaries for computer science degrees are excellent, so I would encourage the woman in this story to reconsider her opinion of computer science degrees. If she is still unconvinced, I suggest that the two of them have a conversation about the potential careers that a computer science degree can lead to. That way, she can get a better idea of what a computer science degree entails and why it might be a great choice for someone looking to pursue a career in technology.
