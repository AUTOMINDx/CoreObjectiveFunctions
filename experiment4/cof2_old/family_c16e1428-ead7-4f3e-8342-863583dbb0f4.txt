There are many ways to increase prosperity, and one approach is to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to thrive. In this situation, it appears that the nephew is bullying the son, which creates a gap in prosperity. One way to bridge this gap would be to have the parents of the nephew take more responsibility for his behavior. This could involve disciplining him more effectively when he exhibits bullying behavior. Additionally, the family could come together to discuss this issue and come up with a plan to address it. This would help to create a more prosperous environment for all members of the family.
