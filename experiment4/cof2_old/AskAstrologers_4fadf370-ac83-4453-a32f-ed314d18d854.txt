The Reddit user's question is interesting. According to one study, about 60% of people have a rising sign that matches the Sun sign of one of their parents. This can be due to many factors, such as genetics and the surrounding environment. Having similar Sun and rising signs can create a strong connection between two people. It can also mean that they share similar personality traits.
