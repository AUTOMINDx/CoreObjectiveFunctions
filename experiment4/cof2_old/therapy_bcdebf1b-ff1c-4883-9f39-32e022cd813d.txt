It sounds as if you have a good understanding of why the therapist-patient relationship is not working for you and that you want to act with kindness and consideration towards both yourself and your therapist. If you are feeling unsafe or uncomfortable in the therapy session, I would recommend finding a therapist who makes you feel more safe and comfortable. There are many options available to you, and so don't feel obliged to stay with your current therapist if she is not a good fit for you. A therapist who understands your goals and wants to help you meet them is key - so do your research, ask around, and find someone who feels right for you.
