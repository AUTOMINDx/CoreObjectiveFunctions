It is understandable to feel devastated after finding out that your partner lied about their age. This can be seen as a breach of trust, and can cause trust issues in future relationships. It is important to remember that this does not mean that your partner is a bad person, but may have lied for reasons such as insecurity or a lack of self-esteem. If your partner is on the autism spectrum, it is important to understand their behavior and why they may have lied. If you still feel that you cannot forgive your partner for lying, it may be best to end the relationship.
