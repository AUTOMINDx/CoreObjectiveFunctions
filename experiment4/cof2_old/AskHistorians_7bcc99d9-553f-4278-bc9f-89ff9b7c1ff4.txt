There is no one specific origin for the idea of a hidden city, but it is likely based on a combination of fact and fiction. Historically, some cities have been hidden for religious or political reasons. However, in modern fiction, the hidden city often serves as a refuge or secret society. The first work of fiction to feature a hidden city was probably The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.
