Reddit user asks: How do you learn all these IC's? Is it just experience? Is there some sort of catalogue for them? Some rhyme or sense behind the number designation? There is no one answer to this question. The most experienced engineers probably have a better understanding of the logic behind IC designations, but anyone can learn them with enough practice. There is a lot of trial and error involved in learning electronics, so don't be afraid to make mistakes. There are many resources available to help you learn electronics. There are online tutorials, YouTube videos, and even entire courses that you can take. You can also find datasheets for all sorts of electronic components online. Take your time and experiment as much as possible. With practice, you'll start to see patterns and correlations between IC designations and the functions they perform.
