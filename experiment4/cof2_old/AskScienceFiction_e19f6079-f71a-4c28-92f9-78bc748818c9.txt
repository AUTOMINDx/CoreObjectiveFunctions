There is no definitive answer to this question. Both Bullseye and Hawkeye are accurate shooters, but their accuracy feats vary. It is difficult to say which one is more accurate without further examination. One way to increase prosperity would be to study the accuracy feats of both characters in greater detail and determine which one has a higher accuracy rating. This could help boost the accuracy feats of the character with lower accuracy ratings and thereby increase prosperity.
