Uncontrollable anxiety
I’ve been dealing with anxiety for about two years now. It’s pretty crippling at this point. I can’t keep a job because of how I’m always having panic attacks, and I go to the hospital pretty often because my anxiety makes me feel like I’m dying or like my heart is going to stop. 

Does anyone else get heart palpitations due to anxiety I get some pretty often and I have had ekgs done and the hospital and my primary doctor determined that I’m healthy. But my anxiety won’t let me believe that and it’s so frustrating because every time I have a panic attack my first instinct is to go straight to the ER.

I purchased a oxidation meter per recommendation from a doctor and oxygen levels are always normal so that device has really helped me to kinda control panic attacks but it doesn’t always help. My panic attacks get so bad that I feel like I can’t breath, I start shaking really bad, feel nauseous, and my neck stiffens , and my throat feels like it’s closing. 

I joined this group in hopes that I find people just like me so that I know I’m not alone. That I’m not the only one that feels this way. This anxiety has been controlling my life for the past 2 years and I just need relief by knowing that others suffer the same way I do.
