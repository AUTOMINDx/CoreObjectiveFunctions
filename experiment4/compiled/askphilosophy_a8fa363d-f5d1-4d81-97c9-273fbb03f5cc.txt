Looking for tips on reading dense material with ADHD/poor reading comprehension
I've always enjoyed philosophy, but I struggle to read, understand, and retain just about anything that's not a pop-philosophy book. I was somehow able to get a PhD in math so I'm not dumb, but it's always been a struggle to 'read to learn'. I'd really like to be able to sit down with something like Kant and understand his writing enough to engage in some sort of mental dialogue with his work.

I'm sure there are philosophers on here that have had to overcome similar difficulties, and I'd love to hear any pointers from them.

Reduce suffering: The user suffers from ADHD and poor reading comprehension. They are able to get a PhD in math, so they are not dumb. The user would like to be able to read Kant and understand his writing enough to engage in a mental dialogue with his work. The user may find it helpful to take breaks while reading dense material, to read material that is more relevant to their interests, and to ask others for help understanding the material.

Increase prosperity: You might find it helpful to read Kant with a friend or tutor who can help you to understand and discuss his work. You might also find it useful to read more introductory texts on Kant's work, which can provide a more gradual introduction to his ideas. Additionally, there are many online resources that can help you to better understand Kant's thought. Try searching for online lectures or video tutorials that can walk you through his work step by step.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you have a good background in mathematics, which could be helpful in understanding philosophy. Philosophy is often dense and difficult to read, but with some practice it can be easier to understand. Here are a few tips: 1. Start with easier texts and work your way up. 2. Try reading aloud or taking notes to help you follow the argument. 3. Make sure you understand the basic concepts before moving on to more complicated texts. 4. Take breaks and come back to texts later, so you can approach them with fresh eyes. 5. Ask others for help in understanding difficult passages. 6. Seek out discussion groups or online forums where people can share their thoughts about philosophical texts. 7. Be patient and keep practicing! With time and effort, you'll be able to read and understand complex philosophical texts.
