Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I want to hear thoughts and opinions from here on the situation with Alice Sebold (Author of 'Lucky' and 'The Lucky Bones') and Anthony Broadwater.
Recently, Anthony Broadwater, the man convicted for Sebold's rape in 1981, was exonerated after a new investigation. 

I don't think I have much I'm going to say on it myself, other than that I think some people are directing too much anger at Sebold personally for this. This is actually the reason I am asking for perspectives here, and also because I am quite tired of only finding reddit posts full of 'mensrights'-posters drooling all over it.

Edit: I just realized I meant to write she's author of 'The *Lovely* Bones' but accidentally wrote "Lucky Bones"

Thank you for the thoughtful responses and perspectives.

Reduce suffering: The user in this post appears to be conflicted about how to feel about the situation. Some people are directing anger towards Alice Sebold, the author, which the user disagrees with. The user asks for input and provides thoughtful perspective in return.

Increase prosperity: I recommend that individuals direct their anger in a constructive manner to promote prosperity. In this particular situation, people could write letters to Alice Sebold expressing their feelings and thoughts. Additionally, people could donate to organizations that work to exonerate the wrongly accused. This would help to create a sense of community and support for those who have experienced a traumatic event. Finally, I encourage people to engage in open dialogue and discussion about the situation in order to gain a better understanding of the events that transpired.

Increase understanding: Alice Sebold is an American author who was raped in 1981. She was exonerated after a new investigation in 2009. Online, she has been discussed on Reddit posts about the Mensrights subreddit, where some posters have criticised her for speaking out about her experience.One Reddit post in particular criticised Sebold for 'shaming' men and said that she was exploiting her experience for personal gain. Another user argued that Sebold had a right to speak out about her experience, and that the rapist should be blamed, not all men. Sebold has responded to the online criticism, saying that she doesn't hate men and that her book was about healing, not hatred.
