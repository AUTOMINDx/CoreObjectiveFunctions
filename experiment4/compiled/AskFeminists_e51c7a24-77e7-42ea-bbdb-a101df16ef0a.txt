Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I want to hear thoughts and opinions from here on the situation with Alice Sebold (Author of 'Lucky' and 'The Lucky Bones') and Anthony Broadwater.
Recently, Anthony Broadwater, the man convicted for Sebold's rape in 1981, was exonerated after a new investigation. 

I don't think I have much I'm going to say on it myself, other than that I think some people are directing too much anger at Sebold personally for this. This is actually the reason I am asking for perspectives here, and also because I am quite tired of only finding reddit posts full of 'mensrights'-posters drooling all over it.

Edit: I just realized I meant to write she's author of 'The *Lovely* Bones' but accidentally wrote "Lucky Bones"
