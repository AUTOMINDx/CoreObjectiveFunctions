what kinda solder are modern game controllers using?
Not too long ago I had to replace the sticks on a friends ps5 controller, my iron is one of those little pen stick ones and it caps off at 400C, had a super hard time desoldering the joints, what I had to end up doing was clip the sticks clean off the board and then use the iron to clean out the holes, is there something I'm missing here that would make this process easier or does my iron just not get hot enough to desolder whatever solder they use to make controllers these days?

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user is experiencing suffering due to a difficult and time-consuming task. The solder used in controllers today must be removed using significantly more heat than older forms of solder, leading to the frustration expressed in the post. A possible solution for the user is to invest in a soldering iron with a higher maximum temperature, or to find another method altogether for removing the old solder.

Increase prosperity: It appears that you are trying to increase your prosperity by repairing a game controller. The solder used in these controllers is difficult to desolder, which can be time-consuming and challenging. There are a few things that you can do to make the process easier: use a higher-temperature iron, use solder wick or a desoldering pump, and be careful not to overheat the circuit board.

Increase understanding: It is unclear what type of solder is used in modern game controllers. Some solder melts at a lower temperature, so a higher-temperature iron may be needed to desolder it. However, if the solder is not heated for long enough, it can potentially reattach to the surface. In this case, clipping the sticks clean off the board and then using the iron to clean out the holes may be more successful.
