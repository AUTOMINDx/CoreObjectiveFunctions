How to stop changing my mind about careers?
I’m close to graduating college and I have this bad habit of being really interested in a career for a few months and then losing complete interest a few months later. I know I want to work in the healthcare field, but I don’t know where I fit. 

I’m not sure if it’s my intuition or just me being scared to commit to a career path, but I need to figure out what im going to do after I graduate. Im looking into getting another degree or just going to trade school and picking something. 

My only requirements for a career is that it’s in healthcare, it pays roughly 65-70k (I live in TX so COL is pretty low but I want to be comfortable), and I can work 3-4 days so I have time to start a family in the future.

Reduce suffering: This user seems to be struggling with making a decision about their career. They are scared to commit to a path, and they have a limited range of options that they feel comfortable with. They would like some guidance on what to do. I recommend that the user seek out counseling or therapy to help them figure out what they want from their career. They might also find it helpful to talk to people who have already made the decision they are struggling with, in order to get more information and perspective. Finally, they could try taking some tests or exercises designed to help people find their ideal career path.
