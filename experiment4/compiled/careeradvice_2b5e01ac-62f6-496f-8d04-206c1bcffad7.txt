Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Underpaid and overworked
I’m sure a lot of people can relate, but I’ve reached a point where quitting somehow seems like the best career move. I’d love some advice.  Listing out some major points below.

1. I’m 31, and have been with the same company for 4.5 years. Started entry level and received 3 promotions over that time and am now in an Analyst role. 
2. Over most of the last two years I’ve had to cover responsibilities of another role due to turnover/LOA.  Essentially I’ve been working 1.5-2 positions at various points over the last two years and average 50-70 hours per week.
3. Due to a recent departure I’m now the senior member of my team by a full year and a half. 
4. I’m making the least of all other analysts on my team. 
5. Asked for a raise a month ago. My ask was high for a mid year raise (20%) but was still 5% under what the other analysts on my team are making.  I was denied, and my boss got a 20% raise in the same week. 
6. The only difference on paper between me and the other analysts on my team is that they worked for another company in an analyst role prior to this one.  (I know this is a big deal albeit arbitrary, and I’ve been looking for other jobs since this is likely the only way to a higher payday).

I’m writing a resignation letter which I might submit mid December.  Not sure whether I’ll follow through, but the act of writing it is therapeutic in a sense. 

What I’d like to do is present an ultimatum: Either approve my raise, or I’m leaving. However, I’m concerned that this tactic will be perceived as childish and could unnecessarily burn a bridge.  Does anyone have any input, suggestions or general advice?  Thanks for reading and for any advice you give.

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user is experiencing a great deal of suffering. He is overworked and underpaid, and his position is in danger of being eliminated. He has asked for a raise, but has been denied. His boss received a raise in the same week. The only difference between him and other analysts on his team is that they worked for another company in an analyst role prior to this one.

Increase prosperity: Reddit user, you are underpaid and overworked. I sympathize with your situation and feel that you should take action to increase your prosperity. You have worked hard for your company and have been promoted multiple times. However, you are making the least of all the analysts on your team. This is unfair, and I advise you to ask for a raise. Your boss recently received a raise, so it is justified to ask for one as well. If you do not receive a raise, then I advise you to leave your current company and find another one where you will be compensated fairly. Thank you for reading.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you are feeling overworked and underpaid. It's understandable to feel this way, especially given that you've been working so hard in your role. I want to offer some advice on how to handle the situation. Firstly, it's important to understand that your employer may be unwilling to give you a raise due to budget constraints or other factors. However, it is worth trying to negotiate for a raise. You could try framing it as an ultimatum - asking for a raise or resigning. This may be more effective than simply asking for a raise outright. If your employer denies your request for a raise, it may be time to consider looking for another job. In this case, it is important to maintain a professional relationship with your current employer. Burning bridges with your old employer could negatively impact your future job prospects.
