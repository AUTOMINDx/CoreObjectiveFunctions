Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Does anyone feel like their loved ones question your anxiety?
I have been dealing with anxiety for years now and to some extent I know that my friends and family see this. Often times though I end up feeling like they think I’m using it as an excuse or that it’s not real. If I have an attack or a breakdown it feels like they think I’m over reacting or that I should be able to just handle things the same way they do. I have tried to explain how the anxiety cripples me and how when I have an episode or whatever that I do not have the capacity to just snap out of it. Yet I still feel as if they think I’m exaggerating. It pushes me into a space of not wanting to be around anyone because I don’t feel understood, heard, or respected for what I’m dealing with mentally. Does anyone else have issues like this or suggestions? I’m at a loss.

Reduce suffering: This user is experiencing a great deal of suffering due to the questioning of their loved ones about their anxiety. This questioning can be seen as invalidating and dismissive of the user's experience. This can cause a great deal of pain and result in a feeling of isolation. Some potential solutions for this user could be to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help them process these feelings, or to talk to their loved ones about how their questioning makes them feel.

Increase prosperity: Anxiety can be a very real and debilitating experience, which can be difficult to understand if you have never experienced it yourself. Loved ones may questioning your anxiety, but it is important that they try to understand and empathize with what you are going through. You should express how the anxiety affects you and how it makes you feel when you have an attack or breakdown. Feeling understood, heard, and respected can be very important for someone struggling with anxiety. There are many ways to bridge the gap in prosperity for those experiencing anxiety, and each person will need to find what works best for them. Some people may find therapy or medication to be helpful, while others may find self-care activities like yoga or meditation to be more effective. It is important to keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and what works for one person may not work for another. There are many resources available to help those struggling with anxiety, so do not hesitate to seek out help

Increase understanding: It sounds like you feel misunderstood by your loved ones when it comes to your anxiety. It can be difficult to understand and cope with anxiety if you haven't experienced it yourself. It sounds like you have tried to explain how debilitating the experience can be, but they still don't quite understand. One thing that might help is to continue trying to express yourself in a way that they can understand. Use examples or analogies that they will be able to relate to. For instance, if you feel like they think you're using anxiety as an excuse, try explaining how it feels when an attack hits. Take into account their perspective and what might make the most sense to them. If they are still having a hard time understanding, consider finding a support group or meeting with a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders. This can provide more education about the condition and allow you to talk about your experiences with people who will understand them.
