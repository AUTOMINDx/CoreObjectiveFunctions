How do I protect myself from misuse of philosophy?
I have only recently become aware of how philosophy ….can be a fascinating way to interpret EVERYTHING! (Thank you Wisecrack(I’m slightly embarrassed by that admission))

There is a dark side though. Well. I think there is a dark side. I watched a you tube video this evening (Jordan Peterson: The Fatal Flaw in American Leftist Politics | Big Think). My lizard brain had a….negative reaction to a lot of the conclusions being formed throughout the video. He name checked a bunch of philosophies, then sort of “yadda yadda yaddas” through a balanced interpretation. I THINK that’s what happened. But I am not sophisticated enough at present to deconstruct WHY I had a negative reaction. I mean aside from the variety of hot pieces and my opinion of the people he keeps company with; but that doesn’t feel like a valid reason to dismiss his perspective?

I am 42 years old. I’ve got 2 kids. I’ve attempted to focus on stabilizing my life in terms of studying or pursuing professions that I believed provided a solid/stable life. (Data analytics/statistic/Digital product management). Yes I plan on reading more and attempting to learn more…..but I will NEVER catch up to a dedicated philosopher. I can only pull lessons as I hear them and try to incorporate them into my world view.

My gut reaction to the video made me think of Jaunita Marquez from Snow Crash; where she goes through this extremely harrowing, dangerous experience for precious information/understanding. I don’t have that bandwidth:-)

So….how do I arm myself against fallacious interpretations? (If my example above is actually fallacious). Is it just I need more exposure to more philosophical frameworks? Do I just start to use r/askphilosophy whenever I need a second set of insights? Is there a ….trusted set of heuristics that solve 80% of the defense and will at least point out areas to beware?

I apologize if this question isn’t the right place. I wasn’t sure where the right place would have been.

Reduce suffering: The user experiences anxiety and confusion when exposed to philosophical arguments that contradict their established worldview. They worry about the implications of these arguments and wonder how to protect themselves from potential misuse. They would benefit from reading more broadly within philosophy and discussing their concerns with other users on r/askphilosophy.

Increase prosperity: 1. To increase prosperity, it is important to be aware of the dangers of philosophy and to be careful about how you interpret everything. It is also important to be open to learning more about philosophy, and to read and listen to different points of view. When it comes to defending yourself against fallacious interpretations, it is helpful to have a set of trusted heuristics that can help you navigate 80% of potential problems.

Increase understanding: There are a few ways that one can protect themselves from the misuse of philosophy. Firstly, it is important to be aware of the various fallacies that can occur in philosophical arguments. This can be done through studying the history of philosophy and learning about the different theories and arguments that have been put forth. Secondly, it is helpful to have a strong understanding of logic and how to identify logical fallacies. By being able to critically analyze an argument, you can get a better understanding of whether or not it is sound. Finally, it is important to read philosophy in its proper context. Many times, philosophers are addressing specific problems or issues that are relevant to their time period. It is important to understand the historical and cultural context in which a philosopher was writing in order to get the most accurate interpretation. Jordan Peterson has spoken about his views on philosophy on a few occasions. In a lecture on the psychology of belief, he said "Philosophy is based on perspective – it's inevitablyThere are a few ways that one can protect themselves from misuse of philosophy.
