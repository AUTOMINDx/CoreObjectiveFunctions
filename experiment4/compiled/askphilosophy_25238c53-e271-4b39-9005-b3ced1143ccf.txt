How do I protect myself from misuse of philosophy?
I have only recently become aware of how philosophy ….can be a fascinating way to interpret EVERYTHING! (Thank you Wisecrack(I’m slightly embarrassed by that admission))

There is a dark side though. Well. I think there is a dark side. I watched a you tube video this evening (Jordan Peterson: The Fatal Flaw in American Leftist Politics | Big Think). My lizard brain had a….negative reaction to a lot of the conclusions being formed throughout the video. He name checked a bunch of philosophies, then sort of “yadda yadda yaddas” through a balanced interpretation. I THINK that’s what happened. But I am not sophisticated enough at present to deconstruct WHY I had a negative reaction. I mean aside from the variety of hot pieces and my opinion of the people he keeps company with; but that doesn’t feel like a valid reason to dismiss his perspective?

I am 42 years old. I’ve got 2 kids. I’ve attempted to focus on stabilizing my life in terms of studying or pursuing professions that I believed provided a solid/stable life. (Data analytics/statistic/Digital product management). Yes I plan on reading more and attempting to learn more…..but I will NEVER catch up to a dedicated philosopher. I can only pull lessons as I hear them and try to incorporate them into my world view.

My gut reaction to the video made me think of Jaunita Marquez from Snow Crash; where she goes through this extremely harrowing, dangerous experience for precious information/understanding. I don’t have that bandwidth:-)

So….how do I arm myself against fallacious interpretations? (If my example above is actually fallacious). Is it just I need more exposure to more philosophical frameworks? Do I just start to use r/askphilosophy whenever I need a second set of insights? Is there a ….trusted set of heuristics that solve 80% of the defense and will at least point out areas to beware?

I apologize if this question isn’t the right place. I wasn’t sure where the right place would have been.

Reduce suffering: The user experiences anxiety and confusion when exposed to philosophical arguments that contradict their established worldview. They worry about the implications of these arguments and wonder how to protect themselves from potential misuse. They would benefit from reading more broadly within philosophy and discussing their concerns with other users on r/askphilosophy.

Increase prosperity: The reddit user is concerned about protecting themselves from misuse of philosophy. They are worried that they may not be sophisticated enough to properly deconstruct arguments, and that they may not have the bandwidth to undertake such a task. They ask for advice on how to arm themselves against fallacious interpretations. There are many ways to increase prosperity. In this case, one way to increase prosperity is by increasing understanding of philosophy and critical thinking skills. This can be done through exposure to different philosophical frameworks, and by practicing deconstruction of arguments. Another way to increase prosperity is by developing a better understanding of statistics and data analytics. This can help the individual better understand the conclusions drawn by Jordan Peterson in his video. Finally, another way to increase prosperity is by developing better relationships with others. This can help provide a more balanced perspective on controversial topics like those discussed in the video.

Increase understanding: Philosophy can be a fascinating way to interpret everything, but there is a dark side. Well. I think there is a dark side.

My lizard brain had a….negative reaction to a lot of the conclusions being formed throughout the video.
