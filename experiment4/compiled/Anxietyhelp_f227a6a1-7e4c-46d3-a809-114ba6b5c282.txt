Am I the only one with a woozy/lightheaded feeling for more then 9 years?
Hi, I have a woozy feeling/light headed since I was 15 years old, now I’m 24 years old. This feeling never disappeared and it came up out of nowhere. I went to numerous doctors to check my brain function, balance, my heart, but they did not find anything. Because of the woozy feeling that didn’t go away I started to have panic attacks. So a neurologist told me to go to a psychiatrist who prescribed me a SSRI, Sertraline. The woozy feeling didn’t get any better. The problem now is that I’m still stuck tot the Sertraline, I take a low dose of 25 mg but I still feel a lot of anxiety that I sometimes can not manage… So my question is if someone has had this woozy feeling aswel? Or knows someone? I want this feeling to go away and to finally stop with the Sertraline but I have the feeling that I’m the only person in the world who has this woozy feeling…

Increase prosperity: Based on the information provided, it is recommended that the individual consult with a neurologist to explore the possibility of a neurological disorder that may be causing the woozy feeling. If a neurological disorder is ruled out, it is recommended that the individual consult with a psychiatrist to explore the possibility of an underlying mental health condition. If both conditions are ruled out, it is recommended that the individual continue to monitor the woozy feeling and discuss it with professionals as needed. Additionally, it is recommended that the individual practice stress-relieving activities such as yoga or meditation to help manage anxiety.

Increase understanding: There are many possible causes of a feeling of lightheadedness lasting more than nine years. It is important to see a neurologist and a psychiatrist to determine the cause of the woozy feeling since you started experiencing it at the age of 15. It is possible that the lightheadedness is due to an underlying medical condition, such as anxiety. In some cases, anxiety can cause feelings of lightheadedness, dizziness, and wooziness. Sertraline is a medication that can be used to treat anxiety. If the lightheadedness is determined to be due to anxiety, sertraline may be prescribed to help alleviate these symptoms.I am sorry that I cannot be more specific. It is important to see a neurologist and a psychiatrist to determine the cause of the woozy feeling.
