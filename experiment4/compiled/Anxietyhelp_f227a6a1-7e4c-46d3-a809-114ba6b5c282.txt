Am I the only one with a woozy/lightheaded feeling for more then 9 years?
Hi, I have a woozy feeling/light headed since I was 15 years old, now I’m 24 years old. This feeling never disappeared and it came up out of nowhere. I went to numerous doctors to check my brain function, balance, my heart, but they did not find anything. Because of the woozy feeling that didn’t go away I started to have panic attacks. So a neurologist told me to go to a psychiatrist who prescribed me a SSRI, Sertraline. The woozy feeling didn’t get any better. The problem now is that I’m still stuck tot the Sertraline, I take a low dose of 25 mg but I still feel a lot of anxiety that I sometimes can not manage… So my question is if someone has had this woozy feeling aswel? Or knows someone? I want this feeling to go away and to finally stop with the Sertraline but I have the feeling that I’m the only person in the world who has this woozy feeling…
