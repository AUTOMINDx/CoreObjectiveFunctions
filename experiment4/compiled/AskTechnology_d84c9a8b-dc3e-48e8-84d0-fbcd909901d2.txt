Is there a way to block something from being photographed?
Hi. I’m an art student from Brazil and I’m working on a project for college. I’m not sure if this is even the right subreddit for it (and if you can think of one more appropriate, please, let me know in the comments) but here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to create a painting that could not be photographed. Part of me wish I could use some special ink that bends light with nanotech or something (yeah, too much Sci-Fi movie-watching), but I was thinking of something more feasible, such as a panel that goes in front of the painting with some material that would distort a photo or something. Is there any real way of achieving it?

Thanks :)

Reduce suffering: This user is experiencing suffering because they want to create a painting that cannot be photographed. The potential causes of this suffering are that the user may be concerned about their artwork being copied and/or stolen, or that they feel their work will not be appreciated if it can't be documented. Potential solutions for this user include finding ways to ensure their artwork is not copied or stolen, or creating pieces that are meant to be experienced first-hand rather than photographed.

Increase prosperity: It is possible to block something from being photographed using a panel that distorts the photo. This can be an effective way to protect your work from being copied or stolen. However, this method does have some limitations. It may not be feasible to use this method for every painting, and it can be difficult to constantly monitor and adjust the panel. Additionally, some photos may still be able to get through the panel.

Increase understanding: Blocking something from being photographed is difficult, but not impossible. There are a few ways to do this. One way is to use a panel that goes in front of the painting with some material that would distort a photo. Another way is to use special ink that bends light with nanotech. However, using this ink would be more feasible.
