Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I relapsed again
I have been thinking about killing myself a lot now recently and it's becoming a constant struggle. I hardly feel hungry anymore and the world seems so dull. I try to do the best i can to keep myself alive, at least till after Christmas but nothing is working. I don't even feel sad anymore, i just feel numb. It's the worst feeling. I would much rather feel sad than feel nothing at all, because I know what to do when im sad. When I feel nothing, i can't seem to stop feeling that way. I'm honestly so fucking scared for my life. I don't want to die. I really don't. It's just nothing feels real anymore. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to put up a fight. I'm really trying my hardest.

Reduce suffering: The user appears to be experiencing significant suffering related to depression and suicidal thoughts. The numbness the user feels may be a symptom of depression. The world seeming dull may be another symptom, or a result of the depressed state of mind. Lack of hunger could be a sign that the body is withdrawing from life. There are a number of possible solutions for this user. They could see a therapist, or speak to a mental health professional. They could also consider medication to help with their depression. It might also be helpful for them to talk to someone about their feelings, either in person or online. Finally, they should make sure they are staying safe and take measures to prevent suicide, such as putting away sharp objects and making sure there is someone they can reach out to in case of an emergency.

Increase prosperity: It appears that you are struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. This can be a very difficult time for anyone, and I admire your efforts to keep yourself alive. However, it is clear that you need additional support at this time. I would encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional or to a hotline such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. These resources can provide you with the support you need to get through this difficult time. Additionally, try to connect with friends and family members who can offer you support. I hope that with these measures, you will be able to find relief from your current struggles.

Increase understanding: I can understand how it would be difficult to keep fighting when you feel numb and like everything is dull. It sounds like you are trying your best, but sometimes our best isn't enough. I want you to know that it is okay to not be okay, and it is okay to ask for help. There are people that care about you and want to help, even if you don't feel that way right now. There are people that want to see you survive and fight this feeling. Please don't give up.
