What is Christmas to you?
Ok this is going to sound like a stupid question and I hope this is the correct place to post this. 

To make a long story short me and my kids (ages 4, 3, 2, and almost 1) recently had to move (read past posts for more context on that if you want). We never were allowed to celebrate Christmas. My mom and stepdad would say it was because they didn’t believe in it. 

I’m staying with a friend and her family who do believe in celebrating. They are fantastic and I feel kinda stupid for even asking this but how do you celebrate Christmas? What is the point? 

So far I’m just seeing a lot of consumerism which I had noticed from the side lines before and I’m not sure I want my kids a part of all that. But I see how much they love and have loved the decorations and then part of me is like learn about it then decide. 

So my major question is what is Christmas to you?
