Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Just want to fake my death and start a new life
I always dream about somehow faking my death and then changing my identity before moving to a new place. Drop all contact with everyone. I read a lot of articles about people who randomly got up and left and have been missing for decades, I’m sure a lot of them had a mental health crisis, changed identity and became much happier in their new life. I want to leave everything behind. I hate the current me. I have for the 22 years I’ve been alive. I just want to start a new slate. 

My name disgusts me, my body disgusts me, my memories and experiences disgust me. I think I’ll always feel this out of place. Apparently this feeling of displacement was supposed to go away as I finished puberty but here I am in my 20s and still as unhappy as ever. Even in fantasies where I become rich and famous I still wouldn’t be happy. I won’t be happy until I become a completely new person.

Reduce suffering: This person is experiencing a great deal of suffering. They feel disgust and unhappiness at their very core, to the point where they fantasize about faking their death and starting over completely. It's possible that this person has gone through or is still going through a tough transition period (puberty) that has only made their condition worse. Some potential solutions for this person include therapy, medication, or self-care measures like writing in a journal or spending time outdoors.

Increase prosperity: The Reddit user expresses a desire to abandon their current life and start anew. This desire is driven by a fundamental unhappiness with the current self. The root cause of this unhappiness is not addressed, however, and may continue to cause problems in the new life. Furthermore, the Reddit user expresses a lack of happiness even if they become rich or famous. It may be that a more profound change is needed in order to find lasting prosperity.

Increase understanding: At first, it may seem like the user is feeling extremely unhappy and wants to completely erase their identity and start over. Upon closer inspection, it seems that the user is simply feeling uncomfortable in their current situation and would like to find a way to become more content. It's possible that the user has felt this way for most of their life, but only recently realized it. This could be due to changes occurring during puberty, or any other event that made them take a closer look at their life. The user may feel that they cannot be happy until they become a different person. This is not an uncommon feeling, and there are many ways to address it.
