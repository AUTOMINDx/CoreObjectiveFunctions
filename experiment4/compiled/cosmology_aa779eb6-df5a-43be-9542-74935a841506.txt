How do we know that the universe is expanding?
It is based on fact that we see distant galaxies as red shifted. But what if that is simply caused by light loosing its energy overtime (which would result in lower frequencies)? Or maybe itâ€™s not overtime, there could be some reason for light to lose energy in these long distances? And not by universe expansion? Considering it is traveling across universe for billions of years, we probably have no way to experiment such extreme conditions on earth? ðŸ¤” Or do we?
Do we have also some other proof of universe expansion?

Reduce suffering: This Reddit user is concerned about the scientific evidence for the expansion of the universe. They ask if the observed redshift of distant galaxies might instead be caused by something else, like light losing energy over time. They wonder if there are any other proofs of universe expansion. It is possible that this person is skeptical of scientific theories because they feel like they don't have a good understanding of them. They may also be unsure if they can trust data that has been collected over immense distances and amounts of time. In order to ease their concerns, more educational resources on universe expansion could be provided. Alternatively, they could explore ways to personally experiment with extreme conditions in order to better understand the effects of distance and time on light.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity, depending on your definition of prosperity. Wealth can be increased through investments and careful saving. Happiness can be increased by cultivating a positive outlook and enjoying simple pleasures. Health can be improved by eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep. Abundance can be created by sharing your blessings with others and being grateful for what you have. And, finally, thriving can be achieved by setting challenging goals and continually pushing yourself to grow and learn. Whatever approach you take, the most important thing is to be proactive and constantly seek opportunities to increase prosperity in all areas of your life.

Increase understanding: There are a number of ways that scientists know that the universe is expanding. One way is through the red shift in galaxies. The further away a galaxy is from us, the more the light waves from that galaxy are stretched out, or shifted to the red end of the spectrum. This is because as the universe expands, the space between galaxies stretches, which causes the light waves to lose energy. Additionally, scientists have been able to measure the expansion of the universe by studying how it distorts light from distant galaxies. And finally, another proof of expansion is the way that temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation are distributed. These fluctuations are thought to be caused by density fluctuations in the early universe, and scientists have found that they are statistically isotropic, meaning they are evenly spread out in all directions. This only makes sense if the universe is expanding. There are also ways to experimentally test whether or not the universe is expanding. One such way is through looking at TypeOne way to experimentally test the expansion of the universe is by looking at Type Ia supernovae. These are supernovae that all have the same brightness, which makes them useful for measuring distances. By studying how their brightness changes over time, scientists can determine how quickly the universe is expanding.
