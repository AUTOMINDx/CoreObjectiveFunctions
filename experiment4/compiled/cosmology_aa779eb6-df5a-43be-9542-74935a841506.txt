How do we know that the universe is expanding?
It is based on fact that we see distant galaxies as red shifted. But what if that is simply caused by light loosing its energy overtime (which would result in lower frequencies)? Or maybe itâ€™s not overtime, there could be some reason for light to lose energy in these long distances? And not by universe expansion? Considering it is traveling across universe for billions of years, we probably have no way to experiment such extreme conditions on earth? ðŸ¤” Or do we?
Do we have also some other proof of universe expansion?

Reduce suffering: This Reddit user is concerned about the scientific evidence for the expansion of the universe. They ask if the observed redshift of distant galaxies might instead be caused by something else, like light losing energy over time. They wonder if there are any other proofs of universe expansion. It is possible that this person is skeptical of scientific theories because they feel like they don't have a good understanding of them. They may also be unsure if they can trust data that has been collected over immense distances and amounts of time. In order to ease their concerns, more educational resources on universe expansion could be provided. Alternatively, they could explore ways to personally experiment with extreme conditions in order to better understand the effects of distance and time on light.

Increase prosperity: It is difficult to know for certain whether or not the universe is expanding, as redditor mentions. One piece of evidence for this phenomenon is that we see distant galaxies as appearing redder than they should, due to their light having lost energy over time. However, it is possible that there could be another explanation for this observation, such as light losing energy due to traveling across the universe for billions of years. Additionally, there are other pieces of evidence supporting the idea of an expanding universe, but more research is needed in order to make a definitive determination. If we wish to increase prosperity, we should continue researching this topic in order to uncover more information. Additionally, we should work on developing technologies that can help us explore the universe and gather data about its expansion. By increasing our understanding of this phenomenon, we can bring humankind one step closer to achieving greater prosperity.

Increase understanding: There are a few ways we know that the universe is expanding. One of these ways is through looking at distant galaxies and seeing that they are red shifted. This is because as the universe expands, the light from these galaxies loses energy, which causes it to shift to the red end of the spectrum. However, there are other potential explanations for why we see these galaxies as red shifted, such as light losing energy over time due to the distance travelled or some other unknown reason. Additionally, there are other forms of evidence that support the idea of an expanding universe, such as cosmic microwave background radiation.
