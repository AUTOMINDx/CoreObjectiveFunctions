Reduce suffering: The user is asking how they can make exercise a part of their life when they have been sedentary for years. It is likely that the user finds it difficult to engage in physical activity because they do not enjoy it and/or they are easily fatigued. Potential solutions for the user include finding an activity that is more enjoyable or finding a way to increase their energy levels so that they are able to exercise for longer periods of time.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to make exercise a part of your life, even if you haven't been active in the past. One approach is to start small and gradually increase the amount of exercise you do over time. This will help make the transition easier and reduce the risk of getting injured. You could also try incorporating physical activity into your everyday routine, such as taking a walk during your lunch break or going for a light jog after work. If you're having trouble getting motivated, find an exercise buddy or sign up for a class at your local gym. Whatever approach you take, be sure to stay hydrated and take breaks as needed.

Increase understanding: It can be difficult to make exercise a habit, especially if you haven't been active for a while. Starting slowly and gradually increasing your activity level can be a good way to ease into it. Finding an activity that you enjoy can also help make it more fun and encourage you to stick with it. And finally, setting realistic goals is important so that you don't get discouraged if you don't meet them right away.
