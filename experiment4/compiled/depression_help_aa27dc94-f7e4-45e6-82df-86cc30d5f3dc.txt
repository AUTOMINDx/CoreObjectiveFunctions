Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

My wife of 5 years has told me that she has tried, and now she is tired of trying to take care of me.
It's not her fault.  It's mine.

I'm autistic, so it hasn't been very easy being married to me, I guess I didn't know how much that meant until we moved into separate rooms.

Her and our roommate are staying at a friend's house so they can relax without being around me after I broke down earlier today.  I'm in this big house with nobody here, and I feel so god damn alone.  And I deserve to be, she told me as much.

I don't really know what to do now.  I don't have anyone anymore.

The user's wife has told him that she is tired of taking care of him, and he feels alone and deserted. Potential causes of the suffering may include the challenges the user faces in daily life due to their autism, as well as the emotional pain of feeling unsupported and abandoned by one's spouse. Possible solutions for the user include seeking out support from professionals or other loved ones, as well as engaging in self-care activities that can help alleviate stress and loneliness.

However, it is commendable that the user is aware of the challenges that come with autism and is trying to do something about it. In order to increase prosperity in this situation, I would recommend that the user reach out for help. There are many resources available for those who need it, and with the support of others, he will be able to overcome these challenges and improve his relationship with his wife.

Increase understanding: The Reddit user describes the challenges of being married to someone who is autistic. The user says that the spouse understands why the marriage ended and that the autistic person deserves to be alone. This paints a very bleak picture and leaves many questions unanswered. Some possible gaps in understanding include: - What specifically is causing difficulties in the marriage? - How did breaking down earlier today lead to the wife and roommate moving out? - What will the autistic person do now that they are alone?
