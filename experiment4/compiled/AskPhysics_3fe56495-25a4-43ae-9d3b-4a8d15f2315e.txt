Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Why is it not obvious that the future is predetermined? Where are the flaws in my logic?
Imagine a universe with only one ‘object’ and one force acting on it, nothing else exists. At the point of inception in this universe, you know everything about the force and the ‘object’. Therefore, you must know exactly how the object will act at a point directly after inception. You can repeat this process moving forwards snapshot to snapshot in time,and therefore know every future state of this universe. Every state is predetermined.

Why does this logic not apply to our universe? Is it not obvious that everything must surely be predetermined, as this universe is no different than the other only vastly more complex?

Appreciate anyone who could point out the flaws in this. Warning, I’m fairly shit at physics.

Reduce suffering: This post contains a lot of speculation about the nature of reality and the universe. The user poses a question about why their logic regarding predetermination doesn't apply to our universe, and suggests that everything must be predetermined. There are no clear solutions or recommendations given, but this could be a starting point for further discussion or contemplation.

Increase prosperity: It is not obvious that the future is predetermined, as there are many gaps in prosperity. For example, wealth, happiness, and health may be unevenly distributed in the present. In order to bridge these gaps in prosperity, we must first identify and understand the root causes of inequality. Once we have a clear understanding of these causes, we can begin to develop policies and interventions that will help to increase prosperity for all.

Increase understanding: In order to increase understanding, it is important to first identify any gaps in knowledge or understanding. In the case of the Reddit user's posts, there are several gaps that need to be filled in. For one, it is not clear why the logic presented does not apply to our universe. Additionally, the Reddit user seems to believe that because the universe is more complex than the other universe mentioned, it must be predetermined. This assumption is unfounded and there is no evidence to support it. Finally, it is worth noting that the Reddit user seems to lack understanding of basic physics principles. This makes it difficult to fully understand the argument being put forth. Hopefully, with a little more explanation, these gaps can be filled in and a productive discussion can ensue.
