Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Why make friends if they all leave in the end?
I feel very sad about parting with friends. From the start of the year, I'll be feeling it, even when I'm just with people I'm only starting to try to befriend. Why bother making friends if they're gonna go so soon? Currently I have some friends who are focusing in different fields from myself. We'll be together for two years (assuming they stay in this school till the end), and then they'll go into university. Uni here is split by fields so we will not be together anymore.

I don't feel like investing in relationships that will end so soon... I know we can keep contact online to some extent (maybe), but mostly online communication isn't very satisfying.

I don't want to love anybody because I don't want to grieve their loss. That sounds extreme because they're not passing away or anything but it's how I feel.

Perhaps this is could partly be an 'attachment style' issue?

Reduce suffering: The user is feeling a lot of sadness and grief around parting with friends. They feel like it's not worth making friends if they're just going to leave soon. They may have an attachment style issue where they have difficulty forming close relationships due to the fear of losing them. This can be addressed with therapy or counseling.

Increase prosperity: It can be difficult to make friends if you know they are going to leave eventually. However, it is important to remember that friendships can last even after someone moves away. You can keep in touch with friends online, and even visit them if they are nearby. While it is natural to feel sad when a friend leaves, it is important not to dwell on the sadness. Be grateful for the time you spent with your friend and remember the good times you shared. Remember that you can make new friends who will share similar interests.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you feel very sad when parted from friends, and that you don't want to invest in relationships because you know they will end soon. This may be due to an attachment style issue, where you have a fear of loss or abandonment. It's natural to feel this way, but there are ways to work on this issue so that you can enjoy relationships more fully. You could talk to a therapist about your attachment style and how to work on it. There are also many self-help books on the topic. Friends can also be a support system for you, and help you through tough times. Keep in mind that not all friendships last forever, but that doesn't mean they weren't meaningful or valuable.
