[CA] am i screwed on my background check??
Hey guys,

I've just received an offer from a great company with a starting date that starts next month which is contingent on a successful BG check.

The problem is that my latest position in which I had recently resigned back in October still says '- Current'. I originally applied to this position back in october so I was still employed at that company but forgot to update my resume when it was eventually looked at in November.

This check is being conducted by HireRight and I intend on correcting that mistake on the actual application form... should I reach out to the HR rep about this error or wait and see?

Reduce suffering: This user is suffering because of an error on their resume that could potentially cause them to lose a great job opportunity. The potential solutions for this user are to reach out to the HR rep about the error or wait and see.

Increase prosperity: It is important to make sure that your background check is accurate and up-to-date. If there are any discrepancies, it is important to address them as soon as possible. In this case, it may be helpful to reach out to the HR representative to clarify the situation.

Increase understanding: From what you have said, it sounds like your background check is being conducted by HireRight. If you have recently resigned from your position, it may still say '- Current' on your background check. This is an error that can be easily corrected by reaching out to the HR rep.
