Health Anxiety...is this GERD?
Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short. I have a pretty bad case of health anxiety at the moment. It's typically not this bad and I've just been feeling a large amount of symptoms like; getting full easily, some bloat here and there, gas, seems to be a tightness/inflammed feeling in the lower ribs. Mostly on the right side. Theyre semi-sensitive to touch. It's not terrible. Inflammation of cartilage maybe...at least from what i've googled. Also been feeling the liquids go down in my chest or whatever which is a strange feeling.

Health anxiety can be caused by a number of factors, including a prior history of illnesses or health scares, genetics, stressful life events, and environmental factors. There are a number of treatments available for health anxiety, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, and medications such as SSRIs. 2) One of the most common causes of health anxiety is a prior history of illnesses or health scares. For example, if someone has previously been diagnosed with cancer or another serious illness, they may be more likely to develop health anxiety in the future. genetics can also play a role in causing health anxiety. Some people may be more prone to worry about their health due to their genetic makeup. 3) Environmental factors can also contribute to the development of health anxiety. For example, if4) One common symptom of GERD is heartburn, which is a burning sensation in the chest. Other symptoms can include regurgitation, nausea, and vomiting. GERD can be caused by a number of factors, including lifestyle choices, such as smoking or eating a high-fat diet, and medical conditions such as diabetes or obesity. There are a number of different treatments available for GERD, including lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery. 5) One cause of GERD is a condition known as hiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm and into the chest. This can cause stomach acids to leak back into the esophagus, which leads to the symptoms of GERD. 6) Treatment for GERD usually involves making lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking or eating a healthier diet. If these changes don't provide relief from symptoms, medications may be prescribed. In some cases
