Health Anxiety...is this GERD?
Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short. I have a pretty bad case of health anxiety at the moment. It's typically not this bad and I've just been feeling a large amount of symptoms like; getting full easily, some bloat here and there, gas, seems to be a tightness/inflammed feeling in the lower ribs. Mostly on the right side. Theyre semi-sensitive to touch. It's not terrible. Inflammation of cartilage maybe...at least from what i've googled. Also been feeling the liquids go down in my chest or whatever which is a strange feeling.

Reduce suffering: Suffering is present in this user's posts as they describe their health anxiety and the symptoms they are experiencing. The sources of this suffering are not explicitly stated, but may be linked to the user's health anxiety. Some potential solutions for this user include working with a therapist to address the root causes of their health anxiety, or seeking medical advice to better understand and treat any underlying conditions.

Increase prosperity: According to these symptoms, it seems as though you may be experiencing GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). This is a common ailment that can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including those that you have listed. However, GERD can be treated relatively easily with lifestyle changes and medication. I recommend talking to your doctor about this to get a diagnosis and to begin treatment.

Increase understanding: You are experiencing symptoms that can be associated with health anxiety, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), and inflammation of cartilage. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the exact cause of your symptoms and to receive treatment if needed. You might want to discuss your anxiety with your doctor as well. Anxiety can worsen particular symptoms and make them harder to manage.
