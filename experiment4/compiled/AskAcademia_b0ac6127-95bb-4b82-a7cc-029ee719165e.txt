Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Unexpected institutions are downloading my MA thesis‚Ä¶why?
So I submitted my MA thesis in August to my former institution‚Äôs open access digital repository. Since then I‚Äôve had 36 downloads from around the world, which blows my mind. I didn‚Äôt expect it to get any downloads. I actually kinda hoped no one would read it, because you always look back at your writing and wonder what people are gonna think!

Some downloads have been from universities, which is understandable‚Ä¶

But I got some commercial and government downloads! It‚Äôs freaking me out!

One download is from a chemical industry company in TX, another is from a telephone company in Prague, an internet company in Brazil, an internet company in Oklahoma, and two downloads from the state of North Dakota. What!!??? Plus a number of unaffiliated individuals across the country. 

My thesis was about conservation, capitalism, and zoos. I don‚Äôt get it. Is this real? Why would the state of North Dakota, a chemical company, a phone company, and internet companies want my thesis?? üò≠üò≠üò≠

I‚Äôm already embarrassed as it is. I wish I knew what I signed up for, having my name out there like that. It‚Äôs embarrassing. I never thought people would actually download it. In a few years I‚Äôm gonna look at my MA thesis and think ‚Äúew how could I have written that??‚Äù Now I don‚Äôt want to publish anything, ever‚Ä¶.why am I in a PhD program? üòÖüòÖüòÖ

I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶embarrassed. I put myself out there for the world. And now random companies are downloading it. It feels weird. It can‚Äôt be right.

Also I don‚Äôt have a common name, so I don‚Äôt even know how they found my thesis ü§£ü§£ü§£

Reduce suffering: The author of this post is suffering from embarrassment and confusion. They express concern that their thesis, which is about conservation, capitalism, and zoos, will be read by people they don't know and are not expecting. This could lead to criticism or judgement that the author fears. They also worry that this experience will prevent them from publishing anything in the future. One potential solution for the user's concerns would be to anonymize their thesis before submitting it to the open access repository.
