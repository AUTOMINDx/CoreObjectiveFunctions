Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

What would be the effect on the development of life on earth if a human body was sent millions of years into the past?
Let's say I'm building a time machine, and there's an accident. I'm blasted millions of years into the past, and I'm stuck there. I haven't got anything with me: no clothes, technology, or anything. Just my body and nothing else.

What kind of effect would this have on the development of life on earth? I'm not talking about the butterfly effect, as in what effect would my actions have on later history: my question is more about biology and the ecosystem. 

Would the introduction of the DNA, microbiome, etc. of a modern human into the distant past have an impact on the development of life on earth? Or would nothing much change at all?

I suppose if my body was sent back within the last 500 million years there might not be much impact, but what if it was sent back 2000 million, or 3000 million years?

Reduce suffering: The user's question raises a number of interesting points about the development of life on earth. If a human were sent back millions of years into the past, would they be able to survive? Would they be able to interact with or alter the course of development of current life forms? There is no easy answer, as so much depends on the specifics of the situation. However, it is reasonable to think that a human body suddenly inserted into the distant past would have some kind of impact, even if it is not immediately clear what that impact would be.

Increase prosperity: If a human body was sent millions of years into the past, it is likely that there would be some impact on the development of life on earth. The introduction of DNA, microbiome, etc. of a modern human into the distant past could alter the development of life on earth. However, if my body was sent back within the last 500 million years, there might not be much impact.

Increase understanding: If a human body were sent millions of years into the past, the ecosystem would be affected. DNA and microbiomes are introduced into an ecosystem when something dies, so if a human were to die in the distant past, those things would be introduced as well. The death of a human would have an impact on the development of life on earth.
