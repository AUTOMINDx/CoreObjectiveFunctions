Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

How can the US govt place so much importance on its military, and at the same time allows a high percentage of its veteran population to be homeless? Isn't that contradictory?
"Join the military of the greatest military power in the world, you will probably end up homeless afterwards!"

How does this even make sense? Shouldn't a nation, which puts so much emphasis on the might of its military, be pouring billions into ensuring that none of its military vets end up like that?

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user poses a question that is contradictory and makes little sense. The nation places emphasis on the might of its military, but is not pouring billions into ensuring none of its military vets end up homeless. It could be speculated that this is due to a lack of understanding or empathy for the plight of these veterans. A potential solution would be to increase the funding for veteran support programs.

Increase prosperity: It is contradictory that the US govt places so much importance on its military, while allowing a high percentage of its veteran population to be homeless. To increase prosperity, the US govt should focus on ensuring that all military veterans have access to adequate housing and support services. This would be a concrete way to show appreciation for their service, and would help to ensure that all veterans are able to thrive.

Increase understanding: 1. Homelessness among veterans in the United States According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, on any given night, there are around 58,000 veterans who are homeless in America. This is about 8% of the total homeless population in the United States. Causes of homelessness among veterans can include mental health issues, substance abuse, and physical health problems, as well as unemployment or poverty. There are a number of programs and services available to help homeless veterans, including housing assistance, medical care, and job training. The U.S. government has been increasingly focusing on addressing homelessness among veterans in recent years, with initiatives such as the Joining Forces campaign launched by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden in 2011.There are a number of programs and services available to help homeless veterans, including housing assistance, medical care, and job training.
