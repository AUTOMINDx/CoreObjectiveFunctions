Why isn’t the genocide of Native American’s spoken of in the same vein as the Jewish Holocaust?
As a subject, this wasn’t brought up at all in my experience at school, and in general it isn’t talked about even comparably as often as the Holocaust is when it comes to historical atrocities. I find this hard to explain given conservative estimates of the death toll of Native American is said to be roughly 12 million according to Russell Thornton, and vary significantly with a toll of 100 million documented by D.E Stannard, author of ‘The American Holocaust’, the reasonable conclusion seems to land at around 75 million lives lost between Columbus’ arrival in 1492-1900, which works out to be close to 90% of the entire Native American population, with 5 million remaining today. Could someone please explain why, with a conservative estimate of twice as many lives lost, it isn’t spoken of with the same condemnation as the Holocaust, or if you were educated on the subject differently to what I was.

Reduce suffering: This Redditor's question is difficult to answer. The genocide of Native Americans is not spoken of with the same vein as the Jewish Holocaust, for a variety of reasons. One reason might be that the number of deaths is significantly greater in the case of the Native Americans. According to conservative estimates, 90% of the Native American population died as a result of European colonization. This number is significantly higher than the death toll of the Holocaust. Another reason why this event may not be spoken about in the same way is because it occurred over a longer period of time. The genocide of the Native Americans began with Christopher Columbus' arrival in 1492 and continued until 1900. The Holocaust, however, occurred from 1933-1945. Finally, some people might argue that the treatment of the Native Americans was worse than that of the Jews during the Holocaust.

Increase prosperity: In order to increase prosperity, it is important to remember that there are many different meanings to the word. Wealth, happiness, health, abundance, and thriving are all aspects of prosperity that should be considered. To increase prosperity, it is important to focus on all aspects of the word, not just one. To focus on wealth, it is important to create economic opportunities for all members of society. This can be done by providing education and training for job seekers, and by creating an environment that encourages entrepreneurship. To focus on happiness, it is important to provide a sense of security and belonging for all members of society. This can be done by creating social programs that provide support for those who need it, and by promoting values like compassion and charity. To focus on health, it is important to provide access to affordable healthcare for all members of society. This can be done by expanding Medicaid coverage, and by increasing funding for medical research. To focus on abundance

Increase understanding: There are a number of reasons why the genocide of Native Americans is not spoken of in the same vein as the Holocaust. First, Columbus' arrival in 1492 began a period of intentional violence and slaughter against indigenous people that would continue for centuries. This systematic extermination was dubbed the "American Holocaust" by historian D.E. Stannard. It's also worth noting that the population of Native Americans was much larger than that of European Jews, so the death toll is significantly higher. Finally, there has been a long history of erasure and discrimination against Native Americans, which means their experiences are often left out of the historical record.One example of this erasure is the fact that Christopher Columbus, who is often credited with discovering America, was actually responsible for initiating the genocide of Native Americans. Columbus and his crew arrived in the New World in 1492 and began slaughtering the indigenous people they encountered. Over the next few centuries, millions of Native Americans were killed as a result of European colonization and conquest.
