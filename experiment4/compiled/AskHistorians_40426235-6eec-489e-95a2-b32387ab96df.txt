Why isn’t the genocide of Native American’s spoken of in the same vein as the Jewish Holocaust?
As a subject, this wasn’t brought up at all in my experience at school, and in general it isn’t talked about even comparably as often as the Holocaust is when it comes to historical atrocities. I find this hard to explain given conservative estimates of the death toll of Native American is said to be roughly 12 million according to Russell Thornton, and vary significantly with a toll of 100 million documented by D.E Stannard, author of ‘The American Holocaust’, the reasonable conclusion seems to land at around 75 million lives lost between Columbus’ arrival in 1492-1900, which works out to be close to 90% of the entire Native American population, with 5 million remaining today. Could someone please explain why, with a conservative estimate of twice as many lives lost, it isn’t spoken of with the same condemnation as the Holocaust, or if you were educated on the subject differently to what I was.

Reduce suffering: This Redditor's question is difficult to answer. The genocide of Native Americans is not spoken of with the same vein as the Jewish Holocaust, for a variety of reasons. One reason might be that the number of deaths is significantly greater in the case of the Native Americans. According to conservative estimates, 90% of the Native American population died as a result of European colonization. This number is significantly higher than the death toll of the Holocaust. Another reason why this event may not be spoken about in the same way is because it occurred over a longer period of time. The genocide of the Native Americans began with Christopher Columbus' arrival in 1492 and continued until 1900. The Holocaust, however, occurred from 1933-1945. Finally, some people might argue that the treatment of the Native Americans was worse than that of the Jews during the Holocaust.

Increase prosperity: The genocide of Native Americans is a significant historical event that deserves more attention. It is estimated that around 12 million Native Americans were killed between 1492 and 1900, which is about 90% of the population. This event should be spoken about with the same condemnation as the Holocaust.

Increase understanding: It seems that the genocide of Native Americans is not spoken of in the same vein as the Jewish Holocaust because it did not happen in the same place or time. The genocide of Native Americans lasted for hundreds of years, while the Holocaust happened over a few years. Additionally, the number of people killed in the Holocaust was six million, while the number of people killed in the genocide of Native Americans is estimated to be around 75 million.
