Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Did anyone else not like ACA or Al-anon meetings?
Maybe it’s the groups I tried or maybe I’m just an insensitive asshole but I tried both groups multiple times and it never stuck. 

The main reason I would stop was because I felt like people were getting competitive with their trauma. I’m a self identified over-sharer so talking about trauma really doesn’t affect me. But it felt like every time someone shared something that happened to them someone else would chimed in with how they went through the same thing but slightly worse or more traumatic. Very little time was spent actually comforting or validating the original story teller. It would be like if you told someone your grandpa died of cancer and instead of saying I’m so sorry for your loss they followed with my grandpa died in a car accident and it was so awful because it was sudden and unexpected… It felt like everyone was one uping one another and no one was truly empathetic or offering advice or steps to help that person process and work through that trauma. It made me not want to share and I typically stayed quiet which is why I gave up.

Reduce suffering: Reddit user is unhappy with both ACA and Al-anon groups. They feel that people are competitive and insensitive, which makes them not want to share. It is recommended that this user find a group that is more supportive and understanding.

Increase prosperity: It seems that the groups you tried were not a good fit for you. Gaps in prosperity can be bridged by finding the right support group or therapy session. It is important to find a space where you feel safe and comfortable sharing your experiences. If you do not feel supported in groups, then it may be time to find a new support system. There are many options available, so take the time to find what works best for you.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you didn't find the right group for you, or maybe you didn't connect with the other members of the group. It can be difficult to share personal information, especially when it comes to traumatic experiences. It sounds like the people in the groups you tried were not very supportive or understanding. It's important to find a group of people who will listen and empathize with what you're going through. There are many different groups out there that can offer support, so it might be helpful to do some research and try a few different ones until you find one that feels right for you.
