Love the health anxiety..
When you've had a long day prepping for an upcoming week of finals, you finally lay in bed, so tired and cozy, and then you start to question if you have carbon monoxide poisoning and a blood clot. THIS is my life with anxiety. 

*We have a carbon monoxide detector. I'm literally not sick in any way, nor is my boyfriend or daughter. 

*I had charlie horses in my feet last night, and now... oh no... I had a cramp in my leg (there's NO way it's from sitting on my leg at my table all day while on my laptop. How impossible!)
