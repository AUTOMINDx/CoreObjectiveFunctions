Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Looking for honest advice on recovering from a huge mess up
I graduated with a double-major BA in Linguistics and German from a large T30 state school just before turning 24. I was burning out at the time and dealing with a number of mental health issues + family issues + relationship issues, but I ignored all of that and went on to a MA in Linguistics at a somewhat smaller school.

Unfortunately these issues really caught up with me, and after attending the MA program part-time for 3 semesters, I left with a couple Ws and a couple Fs, just before turning 26. I took a number of graduate level courses during my undergrad, and had done graduate level research during my undergrad. The work of the MA program was not at all a challenge for me, it was just terrible timing in my life and I completely fell apart. In retrospect I should've taken a year or 2 off before attempting the MA, but oh well.

I then spent about 2 years underemployed at a restaurant, seeking much needed treatment for anxiety, depression and ADHD. I left the restaurant halfway into 2020 and went on unemployment voluntarily, because although i did enjoy working in a kitchen, I was only there to stay busy and support myself while I worked out these issues. I did not see it as my career and it wasn't worth it for me to stay during COVID.

I took a bit of a downturn mentally at the beginning of unemployment, but I'm doing much, much better now than I was when I dropped out of the MA program.

Now I have moved across the country to live with my parents (who have finally started to settle down a little), and I am starting a BS in Computer Science in a week or so at a state school. This program should take me about 1.5-2 years because of my previous BA. I'm turning 30 the day before this program starts. My goal is to pursue a MS in either Computer Science or Computational Linguistics, and I still have hopes of following that into a relevant PhD.

My question is, is my previously failed attempt at an MA insurmountable? If I do well in this 2nd BS, will admissions overlook that screwed up MA attempt? I'm also very nervous about my age now, given that I probably wouldn't be able to finish a PhD until I'm 38 or 40 at least. I feel like I'm in a very difficult situation with all of this. I'd really appreciate any general advice or outlooks as well. I know that at the very least, a BS in computer science would help me land a much better job, but my brain still won't stop pushing me towards an academic career.

Reduce suffering: The user is experiencing a great deal of suffering. This suffering may be caused by mental health issues, family issues, relationship issues, or burn-out. The user may also be feeling overwhelmed by the challenges of academia. It is recommended that the user seek treatment for any mental health issues and consider taking a break from school before attempting another graduate program. The user should also focus on finding a career that they are passionate about and that will provide them with stability and fulfillment.

Increase prosperity: You have had a lot of difficulties in your life, and you have made some mistakes. However, you are taking action now to improve your situation. A computer science degree will help you land a better job. Pursue a master's degree in computer science or computational linguistics, and then consider doing a PhD in a relevant field. You can achieve your goals, but it will take time and effort. You are on the right track now, and you should continue moving forward.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you have been through a lot in your life. It is important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it is not necessarily indicative of your future success or ability to do graduate level work. I would encourage you to pursue a BS in computer science, as it will help you in your career goals. The MS and PhD in computer science or computational linguistics are also attainable goals, and you should not let your previous mistake stop you from pursuing them. Admissions committees are likely to overlook one failed attempt, especially if you can show that you have recovered and learned from the experience. Remember that it is never too late to achieve your goals.
