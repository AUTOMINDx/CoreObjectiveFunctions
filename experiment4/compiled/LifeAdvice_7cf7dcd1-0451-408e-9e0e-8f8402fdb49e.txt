Feeling Stuck and Hopeless ðŸ˜©
Hello fellow life doers. Guess you could say Iâ€™m responsible, sure. But damn do I feel like shit latelyâ€¦

Iâ€™m a 24(M) whoâ€™s been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. It feels like it comes in waves where I feel great and motivated then crash into depressive episodes. Except what Iâ€™ve noticed recently is that my periods of feeling great are a lot shorter and my periods of feeling depressed are a lot longer. Iâ€™m starting to dig a hole for myself faster than I am able to climb out of and Iâ€™m worried. My well-being is slowly declining and I canâ€™t muster up the motivation to work towards creating a better life.

I will mention that I recently was divorced from my Ex-wifeâ€¦ however it was a short lived relationship. Long story short I started dating this girl, got a bit careless, got her pregnant, got married, had a miscarriage, got divorcedâ€¦ all in less than 6 months. It was a roller-coaster of emotions that contributed to a lot more negative thinking. I recognize that this event is probably a big reason for my current stress and depression, but I still think thereâ€™s more to it. All my relationships that I ever had were less than 6 months, but consisted of intense emotions where we say I love you and such in a short amount of time. I think my depressive cycles have revolved around relationships. Or rather seeking love, lust, and infatuation. Love is a drug and damn I get high asfâ€™ off it sometimes.

I think about the next time I will be in love again and that creates the period of motivation for me. Then I meet someone, fall in love, fall out of love, then get depressed. This has been my cycle and I hate it. I feel stuck and I feel hopeless. I see this pattern as self-destructive and honestly a little pathetic. Like donâ€™t I have anything else going for me besides tryna hook up and fall in love? Well no actually and thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m stuck, after my last relationship with my Ex Iâ€™ve said no more to these stupid dating shenanigans for right now until I can get into a better spot in my life. 

With that being said, I need some advice. Before, I would get myself motivated for life by the prospect of a meeting a new partner. Now that Iâ€™m letting that way of thinking go, I need help finding a new source of motivation. A new why. Itâ€™s been struggle to find it and I was wondering if anyone else had been through something similar and found an answer or a process that worked for them. All of your responses are greatly appreciated. Anyways thank you and have a nice day!
