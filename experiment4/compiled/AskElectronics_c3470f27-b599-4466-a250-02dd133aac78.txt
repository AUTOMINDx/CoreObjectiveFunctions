Would a dual-port SRAM be an appropriate way to interface a microcontroller with a Gameboy as if the MCU were a cartridge?
I just watched [this](https://youtu.be/QS4fzElm8zk) video about a guy who made a WiFi-enabled Gameboy cartridge with an ESP32. One of the biggest problems that people have with making these “emulated cartridges” is that we can’t generally run microcontrollers fast enough to have enough MCU clock cycles to do anything useful between GB CPU memory cycles. This person’s solution was to store the bulk of the code on an EEPROM, and roll some custom hardware logic to map 2 bytes of the GB memory space to the MCU. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the MCU can’t go bit-fiddling in the EEPROM, so you’re stuck with whatever code you ship on there.

It strikes me that a dual-port SRAM module would be the perfect alternative. You don’t even really need a direct connection between the MCU and the GB CPU, save for whatever interrupts you may care about. It could all route exclusively through the SRAM, right? The GB CPU could be allowed to memory cycle as much as it wants to, and the MCU could update all of the code at will or just go bit-fiddling to change some values. Obviously you’d need some multithreading-esque glue logic, but what am I not seeing here?

Reduce suffering: This Reddit user is experiencing suffering from a lack of knowledge about how to interface a microcontroller with a Gameboy cartridge. They ask if a dual-port SRAM would be an appropriate way to do this, and they seem to think it would be a perfect solution. I agree that it would be an excellent way to do this, and here is why: The dual-port SRAM would allow the microcontroller to access the Gameboy cartridge without having to directly connect to it. This would be especially helpful for interrupts, which could then be routed through the SRAM. Additionally, the MCU could write code to the EEPROM at will, which would allow for more flexibility in programming.

Increase prosperity: In your quest for prosperity, I recommend using a dual-port SRAM to interface a microcontroller with a Gameboy. By doing this, you'll have more control over the MCU, and you'll be able to update code as needed. Additionally, using multithreading-esque glue logic will help you maximize your prosperity.

Increase understanding: 1. How to interface a microcontroller with a Gameboy There are many ways to interface a microcontroller with a Gameboy. One approach is to use an Arduino Uno or other development board to read input from the Gameboy buttons and joystick, and then control the output pins to light up LEDs or activate motors. Another option is to use an FTDI cable to directly connect the microcontroller to the Gameboy, which can be useful for debugging or adding features like custom sound effects. One thing to keep in mind when interfacing a microcontroller with a Gameboy is that the clock speed of the microcontroller should be at least twice as fast as the clock speed of the Gameboy. This is because the Gameboy runs on a 4 MHz clock, while most microcontrollers run on clocks speeds of 8 MHz or more. If the clock speed of the microcontroller is too slow, it will cause errors in the game software or may not work at all.One specific example of how to interface a microcontroller with a Gameboy is to use an Arduino development board. The Arduino can be used to read input from the Gameboy buttons and joystick, and then control the output pins to light up LEDs or activate motors.
