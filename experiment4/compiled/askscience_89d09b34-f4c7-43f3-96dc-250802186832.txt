How can you estimate the temperature of an arc discharge in air generated through high-frequency AC?
Hi everyone. I'm wondering if it is possible or if there are methods to estimate the temperature of a plasma generated from an high-frequency arc discharge in air, like arcs generated from an arc lighter.

Would it be dependant on the frequency, the distance between the electrodes or other things? The closest thing I found is related to the concept of electron temperature, but I haven't found any clear way to compute it.

Thanks for your help and have a nice day!

Edit: it would be in order to build an arc furnace capable of reaching temperatures up to 2100Â°C, to melt corundum

Reduce suffering: The user is suffering from a lack of information. They are trying to estimate the temperature of an arc discharge in air and have not been able to find any clear way to do so. They may be experiencing frustration or feelings of inadequacy. The potential solutions for this user include finding a more clear source of information or asking for help from others who may have more experience with this topic.

Increase prosperity: To increase prosperity, it is important to understand what it means to be prosperous. Prosperity can mean different things to different people, but often includes wealth, happiness, health, and abundance. There are many ways to increase prosperity, and it is important to identify any gaps in prosperity and make recommendations about how to bridge those gaps. One way to increase prosperity is by increasing economic growth. This can be done by stimulating the economy through investment and spending, as well as creating a business-friendly environment that encourages entrepreneurship. Another way to increase prosperity is through education and training. This can help people find better jobs and improve their earning potential. Additionally, education can help people learn new skills that can be used in the workforce. Healthcare is also critical for prosperity. A healthy population is more productive and has a lower cost of living. Providing accessible healthcare also helps reduce inequality and poverty. Lastly, infrastructure is important for prosperity. Good infrastructure helps businesses

Increase understanding: It's difficult to estimate the temperature of an arc discharge in air generated through high-frequency AC, as it depends on many factors. Some things that could affect the temperature include the frequency of the AC, the distance between the electrodes, and the type of gas in the air. However, research has shown that the electron temperature is a good indicator of the plasma's overall temperature.
