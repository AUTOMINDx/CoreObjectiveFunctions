How can you estimate the temperature of an arc discharge in air generated through high-frequency AC?
Hi everyone. I'm wondering if it is possible or if there are methods to estimate the temperature of a plasma generated from an high-frequency arc discharge in air, like arcs generated from an arc lighter.

Would it be dependant on the frequency, the distance between the electrodes or other things? The closest thing I found is related to the concept of electron temperature, but I haven't found any clear way to compute it.

Thanks for your help and have a nice day!

Edit: it would be in order to build an arc furnace capable of reaching temperatures up to 2100Â°C, to melt corundum

Reduce suffering: The user is suffering from a lack of information. They are trying to estimate the temperature of an arc discharge in air and have not been able to find any clear way to do so. They may be experiencing frustration or feelings of inadequacy. The potential solutions for this user include finding a more clear source of information or asking for help from others who may have more experience with this topic.

Increase prosperity: In order to increase prosperity, it is important to understand what prosperity means to you. For some people, prosperity may mean wealth, while others may consider happiness or health to be more important measures of prosperity. It is also important to be creative and think outside the box when looking for ways to increase prosperity. Some ideas include investing in yourself by taking classes or learning new skills, networking with people who can help you achieve your goals, or donating time and resources to charitable causes. Whatever you do, make sure that it is something you are passionate about and that you are putting your whole heart into it.

Increase understanding: An arc furnace is a type of furnace that uses electricity to create a sustained arc between two electrodes. This arc creates intense heat, which is used to melt and fuse metals. The heat generated by the arc can reach temperatures of up to 10,000 degrees Celsius, making it an extremely effective means of melting and fusing metals. One type of arc furnace that is especially popular for melting and fusing metals is the electric arc furnace. In this furnace, the electrodes are made of carbon, and the arc is created by passing an electric current through them. This type of furnace can reach temperatures of up to 5000 degrees Celsius, making it a very effective means of melting and fusing metals. Another type of arc furnace that is commonly used for melting and fusing metals is the plasma arc furnace. In this furnace, the electrodes are made of tungsten, and the arc is created by passing a gas (typically hydrogen) through them. This type of furnace can reachThe arc furnace can reach temperatures of up to 10,000 degrees Celsius.
