I know that "salutation" itself meant "health"  — please see below.

&gt;### salute [14] 

&gt;*Salute* goes back ultimately to the
Latin noun *salūs*, a relative of *salvus* ‘safe,
healthy’ (source of English safe and save). This
had two main strands of meaning. The primary
one was ‘health, well-being’, and in that sense it
lies behind English *salubrious* [16] and *salutary*
[15]. But by extension it also denoted a ‘wish for
someone’s well-being’, hence a ‘greeting’, and it
is this that has given English, via its derived verb
*salūtāre* ‘greet’, *salute*.

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user asks why many languages greet with expressions related to health or peace. The user speculates that the root of the word "salute" comes from the Latin word for "health." The user recommends that further research be conducted on the topic.

Increase prosperity: It is interesting that many languages use greetings that relate to health and peace. This may be because these are important concepts for humans, and people want to wish others happiness and good health. It is possible that this contributes to overall prosperity, as people who feel healthy and peaceful are more likely to be productive and happy. There may be some gaps in prosperity, however, where people are not able to enjoy good health or peace. In order to bridge these gaps, we may need to focus on improving healthcare access and creating social and political stability.

Increase understanding: Most human languages greet each other with expressions related to health and peace. This likely stems from the Latin term salūs, which means "health." The term was used to describe both one's own health and well-being, as well as the good wishes one has for another. This root is found in many words in modern English, including salubrious and salutary.
