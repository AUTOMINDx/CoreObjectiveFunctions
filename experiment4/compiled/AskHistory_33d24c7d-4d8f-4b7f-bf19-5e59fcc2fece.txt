&gt;### salute [14] 

&gt;*Salute* goes back ultimately to the
Latin noun *salūs*, a relative of *salvus* ‘safe,
healthy’ (source of English safe and save). This
had two main strands of meaning. The primary
one was ‘health, well-being’, and in that sense it
lies behind English *salubrious* [16] and *salutary*
[15]. But by extension it also denoted a ‘wish for
someone’s well-being’, hence a ‘greeting’, and it
is this that has given English, via its derived verb
*salūtāre* ‘greet’, *salute*.
