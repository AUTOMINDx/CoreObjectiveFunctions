Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I tried partially coming out to my wife and it was a disaster.
I'm a 40 year old with a male body, I realized about a year ago my gender identity is maverique and last week I decided to tell my wife. I thought I was going to find support, after all, she has supported me in all my "weird" exploits (I'm very much into the arts, particularly theatre and dance). But she got really mad at me. We've been having problems in our relationship because I've been asexual for the last 2 years, and she accused me of doing this as a distraction from working on our issues. It makes me sad because she was the one person I confided in about everything and now I fell I have no one to talk about this with.

Reduce suffering: This Reddit user is experiencing a great deal of suffering due to gender dysphoria. The user has attempted to come out to their wife, but has encountered significant backlash. It is possible that the wife is struggling to understand the concept of gender identity and how it differs from sex, which may be causing some tension in the relationship. Additionally, the user is dealing with asexuality, which may be causing problems within the relationship independent of the gender identity. There are a few potential solutions for this user. First, they could seek couples counseling to help them navigate these difficult waters. Additionally, they might find support by talking to other individuals who are also experiencing gender dysphoria. Finally, they could look into therapies that can help with gender dysphoria, such as hormone therapy or surgery.

Increase prosperity: It appears that this individual's attempt to disclose their Maverique identity to their wife was unsuccessful. This may have been due to a lack of understanding and acceptance of the Maverique identity by the wife, or due to other underlying issues in the relationship. Regardless, this individual feels isolated and unsupported. One way to increase prosperity in this situation would be for the individual to find a supportive community of individuals who share their Maverique identity. This could provide a sense of understanding and support that is currently lacking. Additionally, seeking therapy may be beneficial in helping to resolve any underlying issues in the relationship.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you have been going through a lot of changes recently, and that telling your wife about your maverique identity was a huge step. Her reaction was understandable given her history with you and the other things that have been going on in your relationship, but it sounds like she may not fully understand what maverique means to you. It might be helpful to talk to her more about your identity and why it is important to you. Additionally, it is important to remember that she is still your ally even if she doesn't fully understand maverique. You can work together to explore your identity and figure out how best to support each other.
