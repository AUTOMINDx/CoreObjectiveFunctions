Looking for a job where I am just a warm body in a chair?
Hi, I'm looking for ideas of any role where I would be just a warm body sat in a chair? Thing is, I already have a remote position that is 30hrs/week and it is flexi-hours computer work. As long as I do the required work, for 30 hrs/week then I am a-okay. So if I can do my work whilst I would otherwise be idly sitting, then it's a win-win, right?

Now, I was thinking that I might as well try and twin-up this role with something else. So I'm looking for job roles where I would just be sitting in a chair, at a desk with nothing to do for 90% of the time. I've already thought of roles, such as: night receptionist. Does anyone have any other ideas?
