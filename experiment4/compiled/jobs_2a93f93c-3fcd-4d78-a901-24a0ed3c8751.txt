Looking for a job where I am just a warm body in a chair?
Hi, I'm looking for ideas of any role where I would be just a warm body sat in a chair? Thing is, I already have a remote position that is 30hrs/week and it is flexi-hours computer work. As long as I do the required work, for 30 hrs/week then I am a-okay. So if I can do my work whilst I would otherwise be idly sitting, then it's a win-win, right?

Now, I was thinking that I might as well try and twin-up this role with something else. So I'm looking for job roles where I would just be sitting in a chair, at a desk with nothing to do for 90% of the time. I've already thought of roles, such as: night receptionist. Does anyone have any other ideas?

Increase prosperity: It seems like you are looking for ways to increase your prosperity by finding a job where you would be sitting in a chair and doing nothing for most of the time.

For example, perhaps you could look for a job that is more interactive and allows you to engage with others. Additionally, you could look for opportunities to start your own business or work on projects that you are passionate about. These would be more fulfilling options that would allow you to increase your prosperity in many ways.
