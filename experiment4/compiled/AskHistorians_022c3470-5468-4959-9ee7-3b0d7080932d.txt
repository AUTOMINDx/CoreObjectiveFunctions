Was Hans Christian Andersen mentally disabled or just really eccentric?
When you read about Hans' life you get the impression he was a bit... odd

He attended a school for children when he was 22. He would start acting scenes of his plays at social events, unprompted, often interrupting whatever was going on. Charles Dickens was nice to him once and Hans took that as an invitation to spend over a month in his house, never realizing he was making Charles and his family very uncomfortable, never understanding they didn't like him back. He was open about his homosexuality but in a way that suggests he didn't actually know it was a taboo in his culture, like sending letters to men he was not close with about how "they made him feel like a woman," often making those men very uncomfortable...

It just doesn't sound real, it sounds like a little kid who doesn't understand how society works doing whatever he wants, except this was a grown man

Some may argue he was just "eccentric" but he doesn't seem eccentric to me, rather it sounds like he may have had a mental disability. That would explain why he was often so naive and clueless, and it would make his accomplishments all the more remarkable

Because I don't want to make it sound like I don't admire Hans. He wrote some of the most beautiful fairy tales in history and he rightfully deserves the fame he has to this day. If he was disabled in any way that just means his work is even more special than we thought
