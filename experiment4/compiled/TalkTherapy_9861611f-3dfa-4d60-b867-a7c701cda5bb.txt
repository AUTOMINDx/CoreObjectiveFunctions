Huge appreciation post to my LGBTQ+ positive therapist
I (25F) see a therapist (34F) who specializes in eating disorders for my own. I've been seeing her nearly every week for 1.5 years. Today as we were ending I was just spouting off some random shit, mentioned how I wasn't born with a thick skin but I had to grow one because I'm Jewish and lesbian (both of which she knows) and anti semitism and homophobia are pandemics in this world right now. She told me she nobody chooses who they are attracted to or how they identify and it's a shame that other people can't see that. She always has a strong reaction whenever we start discussing conversion therapy (for one reason or another) and I'm so grateful. Generally everybody in my life who knows about my sexuality is accepting, but I went on a very long journey of self hatred and eventually acceptance of my sexuality years ago. I didn't really think much of how lucky I am to have somebody so supportive of me until just a bit ago and I'm trying to not cry just thinking about how grateful I am to have her. Not just because of that but she's helped me so much with my eating disorder. She told me today that she will be there for me whenever I choose to confront some people she has been coaching me on how to deal with their negativity whenever I am ready. I don't know. I'm just so grateful to have her. Like I read things on here about how people's therapists have abandoned them or they fall out or get too attached. I have such big issues with change and abandonment. I know I won't have her FOREVER, but I'm certainly grateful to have her in this moment and for however long after I do. Even just typing this out makes me realize I really need to get my shit together in terms of my eating disorder and I want to be more open with her about other things I am struggling with as well. She encourages texting/calling outside of session so I think I'm going to tell her how much I appreciate her. I don't have any kind of maternal/erotic/whatever transference towards her. I do not idolize her, nor am I "obsessed" with her. She is just my therapist, we have good boundaries, and a very good relationship. And I'm forever grateful.

Don't ever be afraid to tell your therapist that.

Reduce suffering: The user experiences suffering due to their lesbianism and Judaism. They have a supportive therapist who helps them with their eating disorder. The user recommends telling your therapist how grateful you are.

Increase prosperity: Thank you for your post. It is clear that you have a very positive relationship with your therapist, which is incredibly important for your mental health and overall prosperity. I recommend that you continue to express your gratitude to her, as it will only strengthen your bond. Additionally, I suggest that you explore other ways to increase your prosperity, such as by getting involved in activities that make you happy or by surrounding yourself with positive people. Thank you for your contribution.

Increase understanding: It's good to be grateful for your therapist, and to tell them how much you appreciate them. It sounds like you have a good relationship with her and that she is supportive. It's also important to have good boundaries with your therapist and to not idolize or be obsessed with them. They are just your therapist, and they are there to help you.
