Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I'm afraid my anxieties are annoying people around me
I learned about venting my anxieties instead of pent up over years. But sometimes I noticed I no longer get answer back from my friends or family who I vent to. I feel my anxieties are becoming annoyances to people around me, people I trust enough to tell and people I hope to care. 

I tried keeping myself up and only talk about happy things but I can't help it when things are getting harder for me. I don't have good news to share. I only see myself failing and failing again.

When I speak, I don't even expect any long answers, I just want to be heard. But now I'm afraid to be heard, because all I get are cold shoulders. Stares that seems to be telling me to just digest my own problems. So now I'm becoming quiet again. And they seem happier.

Reduce suffering: The user seems to be suffering from anxiety and feels that their anxieties are becoming a nuisance to the people around them. They may benefit from therapy or medication to help them manage their anxiety. Connection with supportive people can also be helpful in managing anxiety.

Increase prosperity: I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and that you feel like you are burdening your friends and family. It is important to have a support system when you are going through a tough time. I recommend finding an online forum or support group where you can talk to people who understand what you are going through. You can also talk to a therapist, who can help you deal with your anxiety in a healthy way.

Increase understanding: It can be difficult to share your anxieties with others, especially if you feel like they may not be receptive or understanding. It sounds like you have taken steps to try and manage your anxieties in a healthy way, by venting to those you trust. However, it appears that this has had the opposite effect and instead of feeling supported, you now feel like you are annoying those around you. This is a common fear when speaking openly about our struggles - that we will be ignored or misunderstood. It is important to remember that everyone deals with their own struggles, and just because someone doesn't have an immediate answer or solution for you, doesn't mean they don't care. Most people would rather listen and offer support than remain silent. If you find that people are not responding positively to your discussions of anxiety, it might be helpful to frame them in a different way - for example, "I'm just feeling a little down today, can I talk to you about it?"
