Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I'm afraid my anxieties are annoying people around me
I learned about venting my anxieties instead of pent up over years. But sometimes I noticed I no longer get answer back from my friends or family who I vent to. I feel my anxieties are becoming annoyances to people around me, people I trust enough to tell and people I hope to care. 

I tried keeping myself up and only talk about happy things but I can't help it when things are getting harder for me. I don't have good news to share. I only see myself failing and failing again.

When I speak, I don't even expect any long answers, I just want to be heard. But now I'm afraid to be heard, because all I get are cold shoulders. Stares that seems to be telling me to just digest my own problems. So now I'm becoming quiet again. And they seem happier.

Reduce suffering: The user seems to be suffering from anxiety and feels that their anxieties are becoming a nuisance to the people around them. They may benefit from therapy or medication to help them manage their anxiety. Connection with supportive people can also be helpful in managing anxiety.

Increase prosperity: The user seems to be struggling with anxiety and loneliness. I would recommend that they find a support group or therapy session to help them deal with these issues. Additionally, I would recommend that the user find ways to engage in hobbies or activities that make them happy. This could be anything from reading, writing, painting, hiking, etc. By finding ways to engage in joyful activities, the user will be less likely to dwell on their anxieties, and more likely to experience prosperity.

Increase understanding: There are many ways to deal with anxiety without burdening others. One way is to take a break and go for a walk. Taking some deep breaths can also help clear your mind and help you focus. Another way is to express your anxiety in a letter or journal. This can help you process your feelings and work through them. You can also try talking to a friend or family member about your anxiety, but make sure to be specific about what you need from them. For example, if you need them to listen but not offer advice, let them know. Finally, remember that everyone is different and there is no one right way to deal with anxiety. What works for one person may not work for another, so find what works for you and stick with it.One way to deal with anxiety without burdening others is to take a break and go for a walk.
