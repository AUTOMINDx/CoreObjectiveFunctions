Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I find it hard to believe that people are close with their parents
I genuinely feel like it is a hoax or something. I've always thought my experience was the standard one. I thought I was one of the lucky ones, considering I was never actively abused and had fiscal security. 

I can't imagine people actually feeling loved by their parents, and having been taught how to make friends and deal with emotions, and not feeling like they're an obligation. I can't imagine actually going to your parents for support and not being 100% self sufficient as a teenager and taking care of yourself when you were sick. I feel like my experience, or worse, is what it's like 99% of the time, and that those Hollywood parents don't exist. I can't process it at all. 

This in turn makes me feel stupid for not being able to deal with my childhood issues. Like, what right do I have to be so affected by it? I should be grateful, and I should be a well-functioning adult who isn't weighed down by a ton of social and emotional issues.

You are not alone in your struggles, and there are people who can help you through them.
