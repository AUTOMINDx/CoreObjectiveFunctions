Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I find it hard to believe that people are close with their parents
I genuinely feel like it is a hoax or something. I've always thought my experience was the standard one. I thought I was one of the lucky ones, considering I was never actively abused and had fiscal security. 

I can't imagine people actually feeling loved by their parents, and having been taught how to make friends and deal with emotions, and not feeling like they're an obligation. I can't imagine actually going to your parents for support and not being 100% self sufficient as a teenager and taking care of yourself when you were sick. I feel like my experience, or worse, is what it's like 99% of the time, and that those Hollywood parents don't exist. I can't process it at all. 

This in turn makes me feel stupid for not being able to deal with my childhood issues. Like, what right do I have to be so affected by it? I should be grateful, and I should be a well-functioning adult who isn't weighed down by a ton of social and emotional issues.

Reduce suffering: This user appears to be suffering from a feeling of isolation and loneliness. They may be feeling frustrated because they do not feel that they are like "the majority" of people, and this is causing them self-doubt. They may benefit from seeking therapy or joining a support group.

Increase prosperity: It is difficult to believe that some people have close relationships with their parents, while others do not. I find this Reddit post interesting, as it provides a different perspective on the matter. The poster seems to feel that it is a hoax or something that only exists in movies. I cannot imagine how someone would not feel loved by their parents and be taught how to make friends and deal with emotions. It makes me wonder if the poster's experience is the standard one. I am grateful for my experience, as I was never actively abused and had fiscal security. However, I can understand how someone might feel like they are an obligation to their parents or that they are stupid for not being able to deal with childhood issues. I think it is important to remember that everyone experiences life differently and that we should not judge others based on our own perceptions.

Increase understanding: It is difficult to believe that some people have positive relationships with their parents, as Reddit user u/ShittiestRedditor has found. It is possible that this is a hoax or something else, as they say, because it is hard to imagine that this is a common experience. People who have good relationships with their parents generally feel loved and supported by them. They also usually learn how to make friends and deal with emotions from them. This does not mean that these people do not experience difficulties in their lives, but they are better equipped to deal with them. Reddit user understands that their experience is not the norm and that it is likely that most people do not have the same positive relationship with their parents as they do. They ask questions about the nature of these relationships and wonder if they are just imaginary. It is crucial to remember that everyone experiences life differently. What may be easy or natural for one person may be difficult or impossible for someone else
