Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

What would you do if you were in my shoes?
My mum is not the same anymore.

I never talk about this to anyone because it’s embarrassing and sad, I have no one to talk to about it anyway that I feel comfortable other then my sister which is in the same boat as me. So here I go.

Basically my mum disappeared about 4 years ago. She’s still alive and I live with her (i’m 16), but she’s a completely different person now. Everything about her is different like a whole different person. My mum used to be the best mum ever, she would always take me and my sibling fun places to create memories with each-other, she would support me in hard times with genuine advice, she would be proud of me when I would get a good result from a test and many more things like a normal supporting mother would do. 

We always were Christian’s, but never anything serious. We would do to church maybe once a month if we’re lucky. It was a healthy environment and I loved life. But ever since 3-4 years ago, my mum became heavily into religious stuff slowly little by little it got worse. I didn’t think anything of it first maybe it’s just a thing she’s doing idk. It got so bad to the point that she doesn’t watch normal TV anymore, just religious stuff. on her phone and camera roll is just religious stuff. All her books are religious stuff. In our house there are religious pictures EVERYWHERE in every room. All she talks about is religious stuff now. I never have a normal conversation with her anymore, even if I try to for example talk about how I have to watch this movie for school and then do comprehension questions on it, she would say “That’s such a stupid movie, why doesn’t the school do a religious movie or something it doesn’t hurt to get closer to god”. She relates and brings back EVERYTHING to jesus. It’s so f**king annoying I cant take it anymore. She never had time for us anymore, whenever I would say “Hey mum lets go to the park and walk the dog!” she would say no I have to do my prays sorry I don’t feel like it. Nothing is the same anymore. I’m embarrassed to talk about this to anyone, I don’t invite any friends over because it’s embarrassing. She’s pushing all this religion stuff on me too. I feel so bad for my dad too, he seems distant from her lately as well I dint blame him.

I seriously don’t know what happened, she’s just turned into a monster. It hurts so much to say that because I still love her because she’s my mum but it hurts so bad to love her. She most likely loves Jesus more then her own family at this point.

And I say this because it feels like the mum I knew and loved, the mum that raised me doesn’t exist anymore. She’s gone. She’s dead. 

I’m really struggling in school right now from all the weight i’m carrying, it’s my final year of school and i’m scared for the future.

Reduce suffering: There is significant suffering present in this post. The user describes their mother as having disappeared four years ago and being a completely different person. The mother was formerly a supportive figure in the user's life, but she has since become heavily religious to the point where she doesn't have time for her family anymore. The mother also pushes her religion onto the user, which is causing the user significant stress. The user finishes by expressing fear for their future with such significant burdens in their life. The causes of this suffering are likely complicated, but one possible factor could be a mental health condition triggered by the religious zealotry. This condition could have caused the mother to withdraw from her family and become obsessed with religious material. A potential solution for this situation would be for the family to seek psychiatric help for the mother. This would allow her to address her mental health condition and improve her relationship with her family.

Increase prosperity: If you are experiencing a difficult time with your mother, it is understandable to feel overwhelmed and alone. You may find comfort in talking to your sister, who likely feels similarly. It is important to keep communication open and honest, as this will help you to better understand each other. You may also want to consider seeking professional counseling, which can provide guidance and support during this difficult time. In addition, it is important to maintain healthy routines and activities, such as spending time outdoors and being around friends. This can help boost your mood and allow you to thrive.

Increase understanding: 1) "How to cope with a religious parent" If you are struggling to cope with a religious parent, there are a few things that you can do. First, try to understand why your parent is so committed to their religion. It is likely that they believe it is the right thing to do, and they may feel that it is the only way to salvation. Next, talk to your parent about your concerns. Allow them to know that you are open to discussing the topic, and see if they are willing to have a conversation with you. Finally, be respectful of your parent's beliefs. Even if you do not agree with them, try to be understanding and considerate. Remember that your parent is just trying to do what they believe is best for you.If you are struggling to cope with a religious parent, there are a few things that you can do.
