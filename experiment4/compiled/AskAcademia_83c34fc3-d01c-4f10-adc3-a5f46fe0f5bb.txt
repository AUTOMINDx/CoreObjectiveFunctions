How best to navigate misgendering as a first-year PhD student/early-career academic?
I wasn't sure whether here, or r/gradschool, or even an LGBT+-specific subreddit would be best. If it's better to crosspost or just submit elsewhere instead, I'd appreciate the heads up.

So, I'm a first-year student in a really great English PhD program, having just finished my first semester. I'm also nonbinary, and use they/them pronouns. This information is public: in the list of new students/areas of interest shared with faculty at the beginning of the year, in my in-class "icebreakers," and, for when things took place over Zoom, immediately after my name. Unfortunately, every single professor I worked with--both as a student and a TA--referred to me as "he" and "him." Even one or two students made the same error. One particularly embarrassing instance of this happened where the moderator for a panel at a conference I participated in a couple months back read my author bio, but substituted in "he" and "him" for all places where I wrote "they" and them."

The trouble I'm having, naturally, is how best to go about this as I go into my next semester and beyond. Up to now, I've elected to say nothing to these people, either publicly or privately. I'm temperamentally a bit more reserved, and I object, ethically, to doing any sort of aggressive "calling out" or, even worse, pursuing institutional action. My temperament and ethics aside, my status as a first-year early in my career contributes to my feeling troubled: though my work draws quite a bit on queer theory, I nevertheless fear either conscious or unconscious retaliation for directly taking things up with the professors individually. This is compounded by my being a bit of an outsider to the "culture"--only one of my parents went to college, and even then as a late adult--and having gotten into this program off the waitlist. There's definitely a feeling like I still need to prove I belong here.

That said, I also know the situation is untenable. At first, I decided I would say nothing and use who respected what I asked for as a bellwether of their safety and compatibility viz. mentorship, but since every person of authority I interacted with this semester failed to do so, I know something needs to change. Moreover, I also still believe the onus is on me to self-advocate.

So, that's basically where I'm at. I want to--and think I need to--assert this part of my identity, one that I embraced explicitly as part of my admissions material and one I've still been open about when I got here (whether people cared to listen or not). But I also am at a bit of a loss as to the best route to take I have amicable relationships with all of my cohort (as much as I saw them given the remoteness), and one or two more solid friendships, and I could see if I can get them "on my side" in terms of correcting professors we have when it happens, etc. But again, these are tough waters to chart.

If there are any words of advice or encouragement or even a better subreddit this belongs in, I'd greatly appreciate it! :)

Reduce suffering: The user experiences misgendering from professors and students, which causes them suffering. The user is uncomfortable asserting their identity and naming the problem, likely due to fear of retaliation. They would like advice on how to navigate these difficult waters.

Increase prosperity: 1. Be proactive in asserting your identity and rights. When people repeatedly misgender you, it is important to speak up and correct them. This will help to create a more inclusive environment for yourself and others. 2. Seek out allies who can support you when confronting those who misgender you. Friends and classmates can be a great resource in advocating for you and speaking up on your behalf. 3. Remember that you have a right to be respected and acknowledged for who you are. You deserve to thrive in an environment where you feel safe and accepted.

Increase understanding: As a first-year PhD student or early career academic, it can be difficult to navigate and deal with misgendering. It can be frustrating and even invalidating to have your gender identity disregarded or questioned. However, there are ways to assert your gender identity and deal with misgendering. First, it is important to be aware of the different ways in which you may be misgendered. This includes incorrect pronouns, using the wrong name, or referring to you as "he" or "him" when you use "she" or "her". Second, always correct someone if they use the wrong pronouns for you. This can be done in a polite and professional manner. For example, you might say "I prefer she/her pronouns, thank you." Third, stay informed about your rights as a transgender person and know what resources are available to you. There are many organizations that support transgender rights, such as the Transgender Law Center or Lambda LegalThere are many things you can do to be more specific when it comes to asserting your gender identity. For example, you can keep a list of correct pronouns handy and refer to it when someone uses the wrong ones. You can also wear clothing and accessories that express your gender identity. And finally, you can keep a journal where you document your experiences with misgendering and how you deal with them. This can be helpful in understanding and addressing the issue more effectively.
