How best to navigate misgendering as a first-year PhD student/early-career academic?
I wasn't sure whether here, or r/gradschool, or even an LGBT+-specific subreddit would be best. If it's better to crosspost or just submit elsewhere instead, I'd appreciate the heads up.

So, I'm a first-year student in a really great English PhD program, having just finished my first semester. I'm also nonbinary, and use they/them pronouns. This information is public: in the list of new students/areas of interest shared with faculty at the beginning of the year, in my in-class "icebreakers," and, for when things took place over Zoom, immediately after my name. Unfortunately, every single professor I worked with--both as a student and a TA--referred to me as "he" and "him." Even one or two students made the same error. One particularly embarrassing instance of this happened where the moderator for a panel at a conference I participated in a couple months back read my author bio, but substituted in "he" and "him" for all places where I wrote "they" and them."

The trouble I'm having, naturally, is how best to go about this as I go into my next semester and beyond. Up to now, I've elected to say nothing to these people, either publicly or privately. I'm temperamentally a bit more reserved, and I object, ethically, to doing any sort of aggressive "calling out" or, even worse, pursuing institutional action. My temperament and ethics aside, my status as a first-year early in my career contributes to my feeling troubled: though my work draws quite a bit on queer theory, I nevertheless fear either conscious or unconscious retaliation for directly taking things up with the professors individually. This is compounded by my being a bit of an outsider to the "culture"--only one of my parents went to college, and even then as a late adult--and having gotten into this program off the waitlist. There's definitely a feeling like I still need to prove I belong here.

That said, I also know the situation is untenable. At first, I decided I would say nothing and use who respected what I asked for as a bellwether of their safety and compatibility viz. mentorship, but since every person of authority I interacted with this semester failed to do so, I know something needs to change. Moreover, I also still believe the onus is on me to self-advocate.

So, that's basically where I'm at. I want to--and think I need to--assert this part of my identity, one that I embraced explicitly as part of my admissions material and one I've still been open about when I got here (whether people cared to listen or not). But I also am at a bit of a loss as to the best route to take I have amicable relationships with all of my cohort (as much as I saw them given the remoteness), and one or two more solid friendships, and I could see if I can get them "on my side" in terms of correcting professors we have when it happens, etc. But again, these are tough waters to chart.

If there are any words of advice or encouragement or even a better subreddit this belongs in, I'd greatly appreciate it! :)

Reduce suffering: The user experiences misgendering from professors and students, which causes them suffering. The user is uncomfortable asserting their identity and naming the problem, likely due to fear of retaliation. They would like advice on how to navigate these difficult waters.

Increase prosperity: To increase prosperity in this situation, I recommend that the user first identify any gaps in prosperity. In this case, the user notes that they feel "retaliation" for asserting their identity, and that they fear not being taken seriously because of their background. The user could bridge these gaps in prosperity by developing a strategy for asserting their identity safely and effectively. This might involve working with classmates and colleagues to correct professors when they misgender the user, or it might involve seeking support from an advisor or mentor. Whatever the strategy, it is important that the user feels safe and supported in order to prosper in their academic career.

Increase understanding: It can be difficult to know how to handle being misgendered as a transgender person. It's especially difficult when you are a first-year PhD student or early in your career. In this case, it might be better to crosspost or submit elsewhere instead of here on Reddit. You have chosen to not say anything to the professors who have misgendered you, but you feel like this is an untenable situation. You want to assert your identity as a transgender person, but you also don't want to risk retaliation or damage relationships with your cohort or mentors. There is no one perfect solution to this problem, but there are things you can do to make it easier. You can talk to your friends and cohorts about what has been happening and ask them for help. You can also reach out to an LGBTQ+ advocacy group for more resources and support.
