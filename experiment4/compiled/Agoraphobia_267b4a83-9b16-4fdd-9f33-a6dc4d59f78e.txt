Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

i went to therapy in person for the first time today
yup. i did it. and it felt good. now im not gonna lie, whenever I get anxiety my entire body hurts, it feels like I have to throw up and shit all at once. so we didn’t sit, we walked in circles around the building and it distracted my body to not have anxiety bc well, im out of shape lmao, so i was more focused on not sounding like my fat ass was gonna hyperventilate.

now if anyone can help me here, that would be great; i have to go again next week and the week after that and so on. but i feel so released that it’s over but i know I have to go again. how can I make it easier? i want to eventually sit down with her and talk but i get so much anxiety. im on 20mg prozac, ozalopine and hydroxizine, but nothing stops this unwanted feeling in my body. how can I get better? i heard this quote online and it was like “would you rather heal or hide?” and I’m so fucking done with hiding. I wanna live. but I need advice.

thank you guys for reading. I appreciate having a support group.

Reduce suffering: The user suffers from anxiety, which causes physical pain and discomfort. The user's therapist has them walk around the building to distract themselves, but the user worries about having to sit down and talk with the therapist.
