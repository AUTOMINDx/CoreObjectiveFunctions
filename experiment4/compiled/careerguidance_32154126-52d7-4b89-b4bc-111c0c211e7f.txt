Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I just got fired yesterday and I need a new job soon. Do people hire at this time?
I worked my first gig as a recruiter coordinator and I helped hire well over 80 sales reps for my first client in a 5 month period and by help I mean I did literally almost all the work. Unfortunately my boss fired me. His reason for doing so didn’t make sense so I can’t really talk about it. He just zoomed me in and said “it’s not working” and fired me, removed me from slack and even unconnected with me on Linkedin. Again I didn’t do anything that I know of that was bad apart from minor mistakes here and there but I always fixed them as they arise, with me the company was making more money than before even (this is a small company like 5 people including me).

But that’s not important as I don’t want yo work with such people anyways. I want to find a new job in the field. To continue becoming a recruiter or something along those lines. I heard that people don’t hire at this time of the year. Is that true? I am low on money because of an incident and i really want to find a new job ASAP so I’m quite worried if companies aren’t hiring at this time like I heard. Also as a bonus does anyone have any advice on what to do to cheer up? That would be a bonus because I’m quite depressed atm

Reduce suffering: The user is suffering from the sudden loss of a job. This is likely a major source of stress for the user, as it may lead to difficulties in preventing foreclosure on their home, making rent, and other immediate financial needs. In addition, the user may be feeling a sense of humiliation and worthlessness after being fired. The user may have difficulties in finding a new job soon, as many companies are not hiring at this time. The user should consider retraining or pursuing different career paths that may be available to them. The user should also reach out to friends and family for moral support during this difficult time.

Increase prosperity: It is true that some companies may not be hiring during this time of year, but there are also many companies that are always looking for new employees. I suggest you explore different job boards and use social media to find leads for jobs that you might be interested in. Additionally, it is important to stay positive and take action. network with people in your field, attend job fairs, and send out your resume to as many companies as possible. You never know who might be looking to hire.

Increase understanding: It is difficult to say whether companies are hiring at this time of year, as it varies depending on the industry and the company. Some companies may be more likely to hire at this time than others. However, it is generally a good idea to stay proactive in your job search and keep applying for positions even if it seems like the market is competitive. It is also important to keep in mind that companies often have different hiring timelines, so don't be discouraged if you don't hear back from a company right away. In terms of cheering up, it can be helpful to do things that make you happy or help you relax. Some people find that spending time with friends and family can help, while others enjoy taking walks or listening to music. Whatever makes you feel better is worth trying!
