Inflation and quark separation
Hypothetically, during inflation, quark pairs would have been separated extremely rapidly and powerfully from one another. When quarks separate a certain distance, the energy it takes to separate them is enough to generate a new quark pair. Would inflation have generated many quark pairs by forcing separation of quarks, or does inflation not add energy to the system when it separates the quarks in the same way that dark energy isn't applying a force accelerating galaxies away from us, but is merely an expansion of the space between?

Reduce suffering: It is hypothesized that inflation caused quark pairs to be rapidly and powerfully separated from one another. This may have generated many quark pairs. It is unknown whether inflation adds energy to the system when it separates quarks in the same way that dark energy isn't applying a force accelerating galaxies away from us, but is merely an expansion of the space between. If this hypothesis is correct, then it may be possible to solve this user's problem with further research into the nature of inflation.

Increase prosperity: It is hypothesized that during inflation, quark pairs would have been rapidly and powerfully separated from one another. When quarks separate a certain distance, the energy it takes to separate them is enough to generate a new quark pair. It is unclear if inflation would have generated many quark pairs by forcing separation of quarks, or if inflation does not add energy to the system when it separates the quarks in the same way that dark energy isn't applying a force accelerating galaxies away from us, but is merely an expansion of the space between.

Increase understanding: Inflation is a period of rapid expansion that occurred in the earliest moments of the universe. It is thought to have been caused by a mysterious force called dark energy. During inflation, quark pairs would have been separated rapidly and powerfully from one another. When quarks separate a certain distance, the energy it takes to separate them is enough to generate a new quark pair. Inflation would have generated many quark pairs by forcing separation of quarks. However, inflation does not add energy to the system when it separates the quarks in the same way that dark energy isn't applying a force accelerating galaxies away from us, but is merely an expansion of the space between them.
