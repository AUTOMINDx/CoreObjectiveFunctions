Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

It’s crazy how different you’re treated after you come out.
Hey, 

So it’s my birthday today. 

My mom, sister, GF, and therapist wished me a happy birthday. Crickets from my older brother, and my old friend group. 

It’s alright. I’m sure they forgot, which is totally fine. Idk, just kinda tells me where I stand. Between Facebook and Snapchat you would think they’d be able to remember. I can’t help but compare it to last year. My text inbox was flooded, my phone was ringing off the hook. But this year? 


Silence. 


And that’s okay. I’m sure with time I’ll make new friends, maybe my other family will come around.

Reduce suffering: The user is suffering because they feel ostracized by their family and friends. It is possible that this is due to the user coming out as LGBTQ, or it could also be due to other factors such as political views or lifestyle choices. The user may find relief through spending time with new friends or family members who are more supportive.

Increase prosperity: It is unfortunate that you are experiencing a gap in prosperity relative to last year. It may be that your old friend group does not understand or accept your recent decisions, which has led to a decrease in social contact. However, it is important to remember that you have many other friends and family who care about you and want to see you prosper. Try reaching out to those people and enjoy your birthday!

Increase understanding: It can be difficult to adjust to the different way you are treated after coming out as LGBTQ+. Some people may suddenly seem distant or forgetful, as if they are no longer interested in being friends with you. This can be hurtful, but it is important to remember that these people may not have fully understood what it means to be LGBTQ+ and may need some time to adjust. You can reach out to them and provide information or resources that could help them understand better. It is also worth considering whether or not you want to maintain relationships with people who cannot accept you for who you are. There are many supportive and accepting people in the world, so do not feel like you have to stay in relationships that make you feel uncomfortable or unsupported.
