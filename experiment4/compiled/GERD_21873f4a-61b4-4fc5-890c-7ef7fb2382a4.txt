PPI is making GERD worse
So my doctor put me on a PPI (omeprazole) because my upper endoscopy showed mild gastritis. I don't have h pylori or anything else my GI doc tested or searched for. The central gastro issues I deal with though are severe bloating and flatulence, so my GI doc thought that maybe the PPI could let me know if stomach acid is the issue causing my bloating. However, while I typically put my head on a wedge pillow to keep the acid reflux down while I sleep, I otherwise don't really experience acid reflux symptoms at all.

Just one day after starting the PPI, the acid reflux is high up in my throat 24/7 and I feel the tension there now. Does this even make sense? I woke up with a bit of a sore acid throat, coughing, and I feel anxious. Am I giving myself way worse GERD by trying this when GERD wasn't even my central complaint to start with?? I'm worried that I'm going to create worse problems for myself by continuing... or is this just the normal getting-used-to-it period of trying PPIs where it gets worse before it gets better?

Reduce suffering: The user is suffering from acid reflux and GERD, which are both caused by stomach acid. The PPI is making the GERD worse, as the user predicted. The user may want to try a different PPI or see a different doctor.

Increase prosperity: It appears as though you are experiencing some negative side effects from taking omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It is not clear if stomach acid is the root cause of your bloating and flatulence, so it may be wise to discontinue treatment and explore other options. There are many possible causes of these symptoms, such as dietary issues, lactose intolerance, or irritable bowel syndrome. Alternatively, you may want to consider seeking alternative treatments for GERD, such as lifestyle changes or medications that do not suppress stomach acid.

Increase understanding: There is some misunderstanding in this post. It appears that the user is concerned that taking a PPI may worsen their GERD symptoms, when their original complaint was not GERD. However, if the person has gastritis, then taking a PPI may help to determine if stomach acid is the issue causing their bloating. If GERD is the original complaint, then it is possible that the PPI will worsen symptoms in the short-term, but it should improve over time.
