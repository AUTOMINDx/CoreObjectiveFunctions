If you misunderstand the Astrological Houses, you misunderstand important parts of your personality.
A few months ago, my friend Dario, who is starting studying his own Natal Chart, sent me a whatsapp message: –  “Hey, I have to ask you something. My [2nd house](https://iordanus.com/2ndhouse/) is empty, there are no planets, is that means I will never have enough money? Or that am I not capable generating richness?” –

First of all, it makes me smile, and then I reassured him about his attitude on financial affairs. But I also remembered that when I started learning Astrology I had the same problem with my “empty houses”,  so I searched for a deep explanation about the system of the Astrological Houses and their symbolism, which is the key to understand their psychological correspondences.

It was hard to find remarkable material about Houses, the most part was very rough and superficial, but after a long period of researches, I was able to fit all the good pieces together to understand their true mechanism.

A couple of weeks later after the message from Dario, it happened the same with my friend Carlo, who asked me about his “empty” 10th House, and 10 days ago even Giulia asked me about her “empty houses”.

They deserve a better analysis, because the informations obtained through them are really useful to complete the portrait of your own personality or the portrait of a friend, related, or others.

A Natal Chart, is a scheme representing the sky configuration of a human being and this sky configuration corresponds to the map of his psyche.

The psyche of a human being cannot be “approximative”, “superficial” or “simple”.

The psyche of a human being is very complex and deep, and the 12 Houses are often the true key to deeply understand it and to have a correct interpretation of it. 

So it’s a shame and a fatal error reducing the 12 Houses to some elementary concept, trivial words, or even wrong meanings, because Birth Chart interpretation, and then psychological interpretation,  will be surely incomplete or completely wrong.

So let’s start to understand some fundamental concepts about Astrological Houses analyzing the two frequent big mistakes profane astrologers and beginners do with them:

They recommend that anyone starting to learn astrology should take the time to understand the symbolism of the houses, as this will help with understanding the psychological correspondences associated with each one.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity, and one of the most important is understanding the Astrological Houses. Some common misunderstandings about the Houses can lead to incorrect interpretations of your personality and your potential for wealth and abundance. It is important to have a deep understanding of the symbolism behind the Houses in order to correctly interpret the meaning of your Natal Chart. With a correct interpretation, you can better understand your potential for prosperity and take actions that will help you achieve your goals.

Increase understanding: The first mistake people often make when interpreting the astrological houses is misunderstanding their symbolic meaning. People may think that an empty 2nd house means they will never have money, when in reality it means they are not very materialistic. The second mistake is thinking that the 12 houses are simple concepts that can be easily summarized. This is not the case, as the astrological houses correspond to complex psychological concepts. It is important to understand the symbolism of each house in order to correctly interpret a natal chart.
