Dealing with negative colleagues
One of my fellow engineers is a black hat thinker. I respect that and generally prefer to have a pessimist in the team, especially because sometimes you need to hear why something is a bad idea. The problem is, if somebody presents an idea this colleague will shoot it down with 10 reasons why it's never going to work. And sometimes it's really basic issues that perhaps sound complicated at first. So sometimes when wanting to get things done, it means constantly having to power through a wall of negativity coming from them. Its difficult to see this as anything other than simply looking for excuses to not do work. How do you guys deal with this, and how would you manage a person like this?

Reduce suffering: The user is experiencing difficulty dealing with a negative colleague. This colleague is always shooting down ideas with 10 reasons why they will never work. This creates a wall of negativity that is difficult to push through. To deal with this, the user asks how others manage this type of colleague.

Increase prosperity: First, it is important to manage your expectations when working with a negative colleague. It is important to remember that they are not trying to be difficult, and that their pessimism can actually be helpful in some cases. If you are looking for a quick solution to a problem, it is best to avoid negative colleagues. However, if you are looking for a more in-depth analysis of a problem, then they can be a great resource. It is also important to keep in mind that negative people often have a lot of pent-up energy and creativity, so try to find ways to harness that energy and put it towards positive goals. Finally, try not to take their negativity too personally, and always remain calm and professional in your interactions.

Increase understanding: There are a few things that can be done when it comes to dealing with difficult people at work, and the first is to try and understand why they are acting the way they are. It could be that they are going through a difficult time themselves, or maybe they are unhappy with their own lives and are taking it out on others. If possible, try to talk to them in a calm and understanding manner, and see if there is anything you can do to help them. However, if the difficult person is not interested in changing their behavior, then it might be best to try and distance yourself from them as much as possible. This can be difficult if you have to work closely with them, but there are a few things that can help. Firstly, try not to take their behavior personally – remember that it’s not about you, it’s about them. Secondly, document any negative incidents that occur, as this can help build a case should you need toThere are a few things that can be done when it comes to dealing with difficult people at work.
