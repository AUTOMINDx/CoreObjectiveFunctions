Dealing with negative colleagues
One of my fellow engineers is a black hat thinker. I respect that and generally prefer to have a pessimist in the team, especially because sometimes you need to hear why something is a bad idea. The problem is, if somebody presents an idea this colleague will shoot it down with 10 reasons why it's never going to work. And sometimes it's really basic issues that perhaps sound complicated at first. So sometimes when wanting to get things done, it means constantly having to power through a wall of negativity coming from them. Its difficult to see this as anything other than simply looking for excuses to not do work. How do you guys deal with this, and how would you manage a person like this?

Reduce suffering: The user is experiencing difficulty dealing with a negative colleague. This colleague is always shooting down ideas with 10 reasons why they will never work. This creates a wall of negativity that is difficult to push through. To deal with this, the user asks how others manage this type of colleague.

Increase prosperity: Negative colleagues can be a major roadblock to prosperity. They can sap our energy and enthusiasm, and make it difficult to get things done. It's important to find ways to deal with them effectively. One strategy is to try to see things from their perspective. Maybe they are just trying to protect the team from making a mistake. Or maybe they have had a negative experience in the past that has made them sceptical of new ideas. If we can understand where they are coming from, it will be easier to work with them. We can then explain our ideas in detail, and answer any questions they may have. If we can convince them that our idea is a good one, they may be more likely to support us.

Increase understanding: Negative colleagues can be difficult to work with, especially when they are constantly shooting down ideas. Some ways to deal with this are to try and understand where they are coming from and to have a discussion with them about why they feel that way. Another way is to simply ignore their negativity and continue moving forward with your own plans.
