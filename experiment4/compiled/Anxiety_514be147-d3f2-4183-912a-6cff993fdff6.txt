Why do people with anxiety struggle so badly with decision making?
Ive had anxiety for most of my life for as long as I can remember, even as a child I would do things that now as an adult I see were anxious behaviors. I've always been ***horrible*** at making decisions. Im not just talking important life decisions, I'm talking about simple things that if others knew how hard it was for me to decide would think Im crazy. 

For example, tonight I was hungry and wanted a snack. The choice was between tater tots or popcorn. I ***could not*** decide. I got so frustrated with myself that I couldn't decide that I just didn't have a snack at all, and got even more anxious and irritated. Over *popcorn or tater tots.* This happens quite often, at least once a day. 

Why is it that I struggle so badly with simple decision making, or people who have anxiety tend to struggle with decision making? It gets me so down on myself because Im a grown woman with bills &amp; a house and simple stuff like popcorn or tater tots will ruin my night \**insert eye roll here*\*. Does anyone else struggle with this? How have you coped?
