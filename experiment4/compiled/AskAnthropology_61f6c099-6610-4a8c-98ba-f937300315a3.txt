What info do we have about the early spread of Afro-Asiatic people and languages into North Africa, and specifically on the origins of Berber and Chadic families?
Hi, searching info on Afro-Asiatic languages is so hard. Most info seems to go into Semitic languages, but there's very little on Berber and Chadic for example. So I wanna ask what do we know about the early spread of this language family into North Africa, and the development of early Berber and Chadic languages? For the little I've read, the Capsian culture seeems to be a good candidate for Proto-proto berber or some distant ancestor, as well as that Ibero-Maurusian ancestry is present among imazighen and chadics. However little more I found.

So what do we know? How old did Afroasiatic languages spread into the Maghreb, and when did they come into the Sahel giving birth to Chadic? What genetic component could be associated with this early berbers and chadics? And how related are they? And where would their urheimats more likely be?

Reduce suffering: This user suffers from a lack of knowledge about the early spread of Afro-Asiatic languages into North Africa. The user asks for information on the origins of Berber and Chadic families. The posts provides some background information on the Capsian culture and Ibero-Maurusian ancestry. However, the user would like to know more about the early spread of Afro-Asiatic languages, when they came into the Maghreb, and what genetic component could be associated with this early berbers and chadics.

Increase prosperity: Afro-Asiatic languages are believed to have spread into North Africa around 8,000 years ago. At that time, the region was home to the Capsian culture, which is thought to be the ancestor of modern Berber and Chadic languages. There is very little information available about the early development of these languages, but it is believed that they share a common ancestor. Genetic studies have shown that the people who spoke Afro-Asiatic languages in North Africa are related to Ibero-Maurusians, who lived in the area during the Paleolithic era. It is currently unknown where the urheimat of Afro-Asiatic languages is located, but research is ongoing.

Increase understanding: Afroasiatic languages are thought to have spread into North Africa and the Sahel region in the early Bronze Age. The development of early Berber and Chadic languages is still being studied, but it is thought that they may be related to the Capsian culture. It is also believed that there may be a genetic component associated with these languages, although more research is needed to confirm this.
