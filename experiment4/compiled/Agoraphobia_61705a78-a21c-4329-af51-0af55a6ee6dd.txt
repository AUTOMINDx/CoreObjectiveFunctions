inspirational success story
so i have had trouble going to this near by town of about 12 miles (seems like 400 when you’re agoraphobic) but recently, the end november all the way until today i have been going. ive gone a total of about 5 times within just 4 days and i went once in november too. 

my boyfriend came to see me all the way from florida and i was stressing and worrying about it for like 2-3 months thinking i don’t know if we can even go outside my home, well he came and it was amazing. he’s such a good comfort person for me. my whole family is like amazed at how much i’ve been out. i only have had 1 little nervous attack out of those 5 times and it wasn’t even bad. i just kinda felt lost where i was because i haven’t been in so long. i’m started to feel like i’m recovering now. 

my next goal is to go to the eye doctor :) kinda worried about that only because my eyes are sensitive since i have derealization but that is my next goal. by january is the end date for it:)
