inspirational success story
so i have had trouble going to this near by town of about 12 miles (seems like 400 when you’re agoraphobic) but recently, the end november all the way until today i have been going. ive gone a total of about 5 times within just 4 days and i went once in november too. 

my boyfriend came to see me all the way from florida and i was stressing and worrying about it for like 2-3 months thinking i don’t know if we can even go outside my home, well he came and it was amazing. he’s such a good comfort person for me. my whole family is like amazed at how much i’ve been out. i only have had 1 little nervous attack out of those 5 times and it wasn’t even bad. i just kinda felt lost where i was because i haven’t been in so long. i’m started to feel like i’m recovering now. 

my next goal is to go to the eye doctor :) kinda worried about that only because my eyes are sensitive since i have derealization but that is my next goal. by january is the end date for it:)

Reduce suffering: This user has been struggling to go outside for reasons that likely include agoraphobia and derealization. The user's boyfriend came to visit, which caused the user to feel a lot of stress and worry in the months leading up to the visit. However, when the visit happened, it was amazing and the user felt a lot better. The user's next goal is to go to the eye doctor, but the user is worried because the user's eyes are sensitive.

Increase prosperity: Congratulations on your progress! It is impressive that you have been able to go out 5 times in such a short period of time. Going out can be anxiety-provoking for many people, so congratulations on facing your fears. A goal for the future could be to continue this progress and gradually increase the number of times you go out each month. This will help to further increase your prosperity. In addition, you might want to consider working on your anxiety levels so that going out is less stressful for you. There are many techniques that can help with this, such as therapy or medication. If you are nervous about going to the eye doctor, try to find someone who can go with you for support. Taking small steps towards increased prosperity is the key to success!

Increase understanding: So congratulations on your progress! It sounds like going to this town near you has been a big accomplishment. It's great that your boyfriend was able to come visit and that you were able to have a good time. I'm happy to hear that you only had one little attack and that it wasn't too bad. Your next goal of going to the eye doctor is definitely something worth worrying about, but if you take it slow and steady I'm sure you'll be fine. Thanks for sharing your inspirational story!
