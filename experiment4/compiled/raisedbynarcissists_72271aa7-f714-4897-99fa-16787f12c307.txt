Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

My n mom doesn't respect physical or sexual boundaries
She is insistent on combing my hair every morning and I'm 23. If I don't let her do it she loses her shit. I have a panic attack in the bathroom every morning over it. 

She has touched my boobs. She has said that if I don't like her touching me she didn't know how I was going to have sex with my boyfriend. She has put her hands down my pants (to check if they were too big... As I was an adult). And she smacked my ass too many times to count. 

Her narcissism is based on looks. I wouldn't say I'm bad looking but it's not too common that I'm one of those people that's 'expressive' or invested. She also comments on how I'm not trying to look good, that I'm a attractive person and so should try harder, or sometimes that I could look good 'if I wanted to' and also points out flaws in my physical appearance. 

This also culminates into commenting when I'm losing weight and then feeding me nothing but fast food! Or commenting that I have 'sexy' body parts. 

She also is so insistent in me parting my hair that she will literally make me push her off of me if I don't. 

She constantly comments on how I smell. 1. Nobody else does 2. If I do I'm just sweating from anxiety. 

Somebody please help me I'm seriously tired of freaking out every morning like there's a wolf in my house

Edit: for confusion my nmom is my grandmother because I was raised by her so for the sub I usually say nmom because she raised me

On that note my edad is my grandpa and biodad is biological dad. I was raised by my grandparents because my parents were addicts. 

Thanks for understanding guys

I'm so relieved to be believed and all the incoming support! I've been struggling a lot with other life circumstances and it's really giving me a lot of hope in moving forward and in my own strength. I'm very grateful for all the kind words and advice and that there's a way out. I have been taking note

Reduce suffering: The user is experiencing suffering due to their grandmother's physical and sexual boundary violations. The grandmother is apparently a narcissist who bases her self-esteem on her looks, and she is exceedingly critical of the user. She also micromanages the user's grooming, often employing physical force to do so. Additionally, the grandmother constantly comments on the user's body odor, despite the fact that nobody else seems to notice anything wrong. There are a few potential solutions for the user. One solution could be to speak with a therapist about the situation and explore ways to deal with the boundary violations. Another solution could be to set clear boundaries with the grandmother and insist that she respects them. If those boundaries are not respected, then the user could remove themselves from the situation as much as possible. Finally, it might be helpful for the user to educate themselves on narcissism and its effects, in order to better understand why their grandmother behaves in such a harmful way.

Increase prosperity: Reddit user's situation does not create prosperity. There is a lack of respect for physical and sexual boundaries, as well as narcissism based on looks. This creates an environment of panic and anxiety for the user. The comments about weight, body parts, and smell also do not create prosperity. Suggestions to increase prosperity include setting boundaries with the mother, having conversations aboutrespect and what creates prosperity for the individual, and seeking support from others who understand this situation.

Increase understanding: According to this user, their grandmother does not respect physical or sexual boundaries. For example, she will comb the user's hair even if they do not want her to, and she has touched the user's breasts and put her hand down the user's pants. Additionally, the grandmother is very insistent on how the user looks and comments on their appearance often. She will also make the user push her away if she tries to part the user's hair. Additionally, the grandmother constantly comments on how the user smells.
