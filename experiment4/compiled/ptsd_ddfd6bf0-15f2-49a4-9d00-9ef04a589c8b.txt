Is it normal to have memory problems years after the trauma?
I was talking with my friend yesterday and he was naming all these things we did. They ranged from two years ago to five years ago. I don't remember these entire events. Of course chunks of my memory are missing from the time of the trauma, and some of my memories do come back after some years, but I don't know. Maybe it could be something else; just wondering if anyone else has experienced this.

Reduce suffering: The user appears to be suffering from memory problems as a result of a past traumatic event. It is possible that the memories are slowly coming back to the user over time, but it is also possible that the memories are completely missing or fragmented. There may be some emotional distress associated with the memories that are slowly coming back. The user may benefit from therapy or counseling to help address the psychological effects of the trauma.

Increase prosperity: Yes, it is common to experience memory problems after a traumatic event. Memories can be difficult to access or may be missing entirely. This can be frustrating and confusing, but it is usually temporary. There are things you can do to help support your memory during this time. For example, try to keep a journal and make note of important dates and events. You could also try talking about your memories with friends or family members to help jog your memory. If the problems persist or are causing significant distress, please consult with a doctor or therapist.

Increase understanding: Yes, it is common for people to experience memory problems years after a traumatic event. Memories associated with a traumatic experience can be difficult to process and can often be blocked or fragmented. It is also common for these memories to resurface over time. If you are experiencing memory problems, it is important to seek help from a professional who can help you process these memories and make them less intrusive in your life.
