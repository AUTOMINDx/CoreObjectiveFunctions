23M. I'm in Bali on my own. In the last 12 hours I've had fully liquid diarrhoea about 15 times, and now just fainted. What do I do?
Diarhoea has been 100% liquid. Literally over 15 times in 12 hours, to the extent I'm confused where it's all coming from..

On about the 15th time, I started sweating, my body started going numb, my vision started going blurry and I heard screaching in my ear, had disorientation and collapsed against the wall (this is just fainting, right?)

As it was happening I was getting quite worried and considered phoning my hotel's reception calling for medical help, but I feel stable now. 

I haven't eaten from anywhere that would be associated with food poisoning, though maybe I haven't eaten enough.

What could this be? Is it a fairly common thing (severe diarrhoea then fainting)? Should I be concerned? Please advise - thank you

Increase prosperity: It is concerning to read that you have been dealing with such severe diarrhoea for the past 12 hours. Some of the symptoms you describe, such as sweating and fainting, can be signs of dehydration. I would recommend that you drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes, either from a sports drink or oral rehydration salts, to help replace the fluids you are losing. If you are able to, try to eat light, bland foods until your diarrhoea improves. If your symptoms persist or worsen, I would advise that you seek medical attention. Diarrhoea can be a sign of many different illnesses, some of which can be quite serious. It is important to receive proper diagnosis and treatment if needed.
