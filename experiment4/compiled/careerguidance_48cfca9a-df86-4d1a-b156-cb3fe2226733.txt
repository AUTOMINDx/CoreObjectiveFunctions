Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Better offer to retain me after resigning. Shall I stay?
I am with this org for more than 6 years now. In the last couple of years I started looking for a job as I was not getting any growth.  I asked for better grade and pay but no one responded until I resigned.

During the notice period my current org came back with the offer to retain me with higher grade and pay better than the new offer that I have.

If I take back my resignation, I will need to notify my new employer and disregard the employment agreement that I have signed (legal?). To me this is non-ethical option. But I am getting better pay and stability by staying. New org provides me better learning opportunity and decent pay.  Note: My job search journey started for getting growth.

Increase understanding: It seems like you are feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, you have an offer from a new organization that provides you with better opportunities for growth, but on the other hand, your current organization has come back with an offer to retain you that is better in terms of pay and grade. It is understandable that this decision would be difficult for you to make. One thing to consider is whether or not your current organization is responsive to your needs for growth. If they were not willing to offer you a better grade or pay in the past, then it is likely that they will not be responsive in the future either. On the other hand, if your current organization is responsive to your needs, then staying with them may be a good option. Another thing to consider is the stability of your job. With the current economic climate, it can be difficult to find stable employment. If you think that the new organization may not be as stable as your
