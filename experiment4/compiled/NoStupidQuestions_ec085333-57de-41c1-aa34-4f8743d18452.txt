What is the appeal of going to a strip club?
I get that there’s hot topless women there, but you go and get hard with the boys and then go home? I don’t understand the appeal of getting yourself all hot and bothered and then not having sex. So you just pay someone to give you blue balls before you drive home with your mates? I know the dancers will have sex with you at some places, but it’s certainly not expected or common place. What is the appeal? Is it just to get material for the mental fap bank?

Reduce suffering: This person seems to be confused by the appeal of strip clubs. They understand that there are hot, topless women there, but they do not understand why someone would go to a club and get excited only to go home without sex. This person recommends that the user investigate the appeal further or try going to a club where sex is expected and common.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity. One way is to go to a strip club. At a strip club, you can see hot, topless women. This can be appealing because it may make you feel happy and healthy. However, it is important to note that at most strip clubs, sex is not common or expected.

It can also help you relieve stress and increase your happiness and health.

Increase understanding: The appeal of going to a strip club may vary from person to person, but most people go for the same reason — to see naked women. Strip clubs have a long history, dating back to the 18th century when Parisian men would go to brothels to see nude dancers. These establishments gradually evolved into places where people could drink and socialize as well as watch strippers. Today, there are different types of strip clubs, including gentlemen's clubs, bikini bars, and full nudity clubs. While the work can be challenging, strippers generally enjoy their jobs. They typically make good money and can make tips of up to $100 per dance. In addition, they often receive free drinks and sometimes even food from the club. Strip clubs typically have strict rules that dancers must follow, such as no touching customers. It is also not true that all strippers will have sex with you if you ask them; in fact, many dancers refuse such requests. LAre lap dances significantly different in cost at different clubs?
