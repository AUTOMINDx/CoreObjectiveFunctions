What is the appeal of going to a strip club?
I get that there’s hot topless women there, but you go and get hard with the boys and then go home? I don’t understand the appeal of getting yourself all hot and bothered and then not having sex. So you just pay someone to give you blue balls before you drive home with your mates? I know the dancers will have sex with you at some places, but it’s certainly not expected or common place. What is the appeal? Is it just to get material for the mental fap bank?

Reduce suffering: This person seems to be confused by the appeal of strip clubs. They understand that there are hot, topless women there, but they do not understand why someone would go to a club and get excited only to go home without sex. This person recommends that the user investigate the appeal further or try going to a club where sex is expected and common.

Increase prosperity: It is understandable that someone who does not understand the appeal of going to a strip club would find it difficult to understand why someone would go there. There are many reasons why people might go to a strip club, but one of the most common reasons is because they find it enjoyable. There are many things at a strip club that can be enjoyed, such as looking at the dancers, talking to them, and enjoying their company. Some people also enjoy the sexual activity that takes place at strip clubs. While not everyone engages in sexual activity with the dancers, it is an option for those who are interested.

Increase understanding: There can be a few different reasons why someone might go to a strip club. For some, it may be simply to enjoy the view of attractive people undressing. For others, it could be to get material for their mental fap bank. However, many people also go to strip clubs to have sex with the dancers. Dancers are often willing to have sex with customers for money, and this can be a very enjoyable experience for those who participate.
