Should we seek ER care for husband (30m) with excruciating body pain likely COVID positive?
30 m husband almost definitely has COVID (see below). He was double vaccinated by April 2021 no booster yet. His fever is 102.5 while on alternating doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen every four hours. He is in near tears from the body pain, shivering, alternating feeling overheated and chilled, disoriented and terrified. He has an extremely high tolerance for pain (I.e broke foot didn’t even flinch, walked on it a mile and drove self another 15 miles not even a hint that he was in pain) so I am extremely worried about him. He can’t even handle fabric on him right now. His breathing is rapid much like with a fever.

For background there’s an outbreak at my work which is also my 7 year olds school. 7 yo tested positive on rapid antigen we were only given one test. 30m husband, myself (36f) and 18month old child all have been symptomatic but cannot get tested PCR until tomorrow and results are taking up to a week right now.

Thanks in advance

Reduce suffering: This Reddit user's husband is experiencing a great deal of pain and other symptoms that are likely due to the COVID virus. The wife is worried about him and wants to know if they should take him to the ER. The pain that the husband is experiencing is likely due to the virus itself, or to the fever that is often associated with it. The shivering, overheating/chilling, and disorientation could also be due to the virus. The fear that the husband is feeling is also understandable, given the situation. If this were my loved one, I would recommend that they seek medical attention. The ER can provide treatment for the virus and will also be able to perform other tests to determine if he has COVID.

Increase prosperity: The individual should seek emergency care for their husband as soon as possible, as it is likely that he has contracted COVID. The individual and their husband should take all precautions to avoid contact with others, and they should also monitor their fever and other symptoms carefully. The individual should stay at home as much as possible and avoid contact with others, in order to avoid spreading the virus.

Increase understanding: Symptoms of COVID can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Treatment for COVID usually includes rest, fluids, and oxygen therapy as needed. In adults, ER care for COVID may include IV antibiotics and antivirals. A rapid antigen test for COVID is available that can provide results in 15 minutes.Symptoms of COVID can include a fever, a cough, and shortness of breath.
