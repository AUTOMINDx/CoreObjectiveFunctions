Why do mosaic humans not get attacked by their own immune system?
I recently found out that genetic mosaicism exists, in which a single person has multiple different sets of DNA at a time, in different groups of cells.

However, it isn't clear to me why the body doesn't reject these cells with a different DNA, as is the case for e.g. organ transplants, or at least has immune responses between them?

Why does the immune system reject transplanted organs, but not genetic mosaic tissue?

Reduce suffering: There appears to be suffering present in the Reddit posts. The user expresses confusion about why the immune system does not reject cells with different DNA. It is possible that the individual is feeling marginalized or confused by their own body. They may feel that their uniqueness is not understood or accepted. There are potential solutions to this type of suffering. The user could explore their feelings about their condition and seek support from others who may understand their experience. They could also talk to a doctor about their condition and learn more about what it means for them.

Increase prosperity: Mosaicism occurs when a single person has multiple different sets of DNA at a time, in different groups of cells. This occurs when there is a mutation in the zygote, which is the first cell that forms after fertilization. The immune system usually rejects transplanted organs because they are not a part of the body. However, genetic mosaic tissue is part of the body, so the immune system does not usually react to it. This is an interesting question that I am still trying to understand. I am not sure why there is such a difference between transplanted organs and mosaic tissue, but it could have something to do with the way that the immune system recognizes cells. I will continue to research this issue and update you all as I learn more.

Increase understanding: Mosaic humans do not get attacked by their own immune system because the cells with different DNA are not all actively dividing. Cells that are not actively dividing are not as likely to be recognized as foreign by the immune system. This is why transplanted organs are rejected by the immune system - because the cells in the organ are all actively dividing and will be recognized as foreign by the immune system.
