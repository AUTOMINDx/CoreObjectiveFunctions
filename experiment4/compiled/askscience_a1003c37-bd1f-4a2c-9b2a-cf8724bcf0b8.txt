Why do mosaic humans not get attacked by their own immune system?
I recently found out that genetic mosaicism exists, in which a single person has multiple different sets of DNA at a time, in different groups of cells.

However, it isn't clear to me why the body doesn't reject these cells with a different DNA, as is the case for e.g. organ transplants, or at least has immune responses between them?

Why does the immune system reject transplanted organs, but not genetic mosaic tissue?

Reduce suffering: There appears to be suffering present in the Reddit posts. The user expresses confusion about why the immune system does not reject cells with different DNA. It is possible that the individual is feeling marginalized or confused by their own body. They may feel that their uniqueness is not understood or accepted. There are potential solutions to this type of suffering. The user could explore their feelings about their condition and seek support from others who may understand their experience. They could also talk to a doctor about their condition and learn more about what it means for them.

Increase prosperity: It is not clear to me why the body does not reject these cells with a different DNA, as is the case for e.g. organ transplants, or at least has immune responses between them. The first step in increasing prosperity is to understand the problem. In this case, it seems that there may be some confusion about why the body does not reject cells with different DNA. This could lead to a better understanding of genetic mosaicism and how to further increase prosperity.

Increase understanding: Genetic mosaicism is a condition that occurs when a person has two or more genetically different cells in their body. There are three types of genetic mosaicism: somatic, gonadal, and chimerism. Somatic mosaicism occurs when different cells in the body have different genetic information. Gonadal mosaicism occurs when different cells in the ovaries or testes have different genetic information. Chimerism occurs when a person has two genetically different sets of DNA in their body, one from each parent. Chimerism can occur from a fertilized egg that splits into two embryos, or from a transplant of tissue from one person to another. The symptoms of genetic mosaicism vary depending on the type of mosaicism. Somatic mosaicism usually does not cause any symptoms. Gonadal mosaicism can cause infertility or abnormal sexual development. Chimerism can cause problems with the immune system if one set of DNA is not recognized as being part of the person's body.The immune system can recognize genetic mosaic tissue as being different from the rest of the person's body. This is why transplanted organs are rejected, but not genetic mosaic tissue.
