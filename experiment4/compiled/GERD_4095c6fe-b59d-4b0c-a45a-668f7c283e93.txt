Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Endoscopy and Colonoscopy came back completely fine. Scared and so confused about what to do next.
This is what the doctor sent it an email. 
“I really think that you have a musculoskeletal etiology to your pain and there is no clear testing to prove this. We have done a lot of testing to exclude big and bad things in the gi tract. I don’t think you need any additional testing from a GI standpoint.” 

So confused about what that means. I’ve had ongoing consistent horrible pain from my stomach for 5 years now. No matter what I eat or what I do it’s a consistent pain and now I get this message. Any ideas on how to heal a musculoskeletal etiology or what it even is? Thanks for all the help guys

Reduce suffering: The user is in pain and confused. They may have a musculoskeletal etiology, which the doctor has told them is the cause of their pain. The user may not know what this means, or how to go about healing it. They may need more guidance from a doctor on how to proceed.

Increase prosperity: It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of pain and confusion. A musculoskeletal etiology is a term used to describe an illness or condition that affects the muscles or skeleton. Unfortunately, it is unclear what might be causing your pain. Some potential causes could include injury, infection, or inflammation. There are many possible treatments for this condition, depending on its cause. If the source of the pain is not identified, it might be difficult to find an effective remedy. However, there are many options available, including medication, therapy, or surgery. You should speak with your doctor to discuss the best course of action for you.

Increase understanding: Based on the information provided, it seems that the individual has been experiencing stomach pain for five years, with no clear cause found. The doctor has suggested that the source of the pain may be musculoskeletal in nature, but does not offer any clear solutions. Some ideas on how to heal a musculoskeletal etiology could include seeing a physical therapist or chiropractor for treatment, or undertaking a regimen of stretching and strengthening exercises. It is important to remember that each person's body is unique, so it is best to speak with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment plan.
