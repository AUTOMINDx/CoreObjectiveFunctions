What does recovery for a narcissist look like? My therapists response
So today I asked my therapist what recovery looks like for me. At what point do I know that I am recovered?

He explained to me that pathological narcissism is all about using maladaptive methods to regulate self esteem. Recovery happens when your self esteem is being regulated adaptively, when you feel happy, fulfilled, and content in life, and no longer act on urges that cause harm to other people or yourself.

I asked him if my urges to manipulate or hurt people will go away once I’m recovered. He told me that the urges will be much less frequent, and that I won’t feel a strong need to act on them.

I asked him if once I’m recovered, if my brain will be the same as someone who doesn’t have narcissism. He told me that everyone has some degree of narcissism, it’s just that when it leads us to maladaptive behaviours, that’s when it becomes a problem. He told me that a recovered narcissist that has good behavioural regulation, is more healthy than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.

Everybody has urges that are not adaptive. Narcissists and non-narcissists. What matters is that we are not falling victim to these urges.

We can recover. We can change. I have faith in all of us.

Reduce suffering: The user seems to be in recovery from narcissism. They are asking their therapist about what this involves. The therapist explains that pathological narcissism is about using maladaptive methods to regulate self esteem. Recovery happens when the self esteem is regulated adaptively, when the person feels happy, fulfilled, and content in life. The therapist also says that once the person is recovered, their brain will be similar to someone who does not have narcissism.

Increase prosperity: Recovery from narcissism can be a long and difficult process, but it is possible. Pathological narcissism is often a response to low self esteem, so recovering involves regulating self esteem in a more adaptive way. This can be done by developing satisfying and meaningful relationships, achieving personal successes, and finding purpose in life. Narcissists will still have urges that are not adaptive, but these will be much less frequent than before and they will be less likely to act on them. A recovered narcissist is overall healthier than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.

Increase understanding: Pathological narcissism is about using maladaptive methods to regulate self esteem. Recovery happens when your self esteem is being regulated adaptively, when you feel happy, fulfilled, and content in life. The urges to manipulate or hurt people will be much less frequent and you won’t feel a strong need to act on them once you are recovered. A recovered narcissist that has good behavioural regulation is more healthy than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.
