What does recovery for a narcissist look like? My therapists response
So today I asked my therapist what recovery looks like for me. At what point do I know that I am recovered?

He explained to me that pathological narcissism is all about using maladaptive methods to regulate self esteem. Recovery happens when your self esteem is being regulated adaptively, when you feel happy, fulfilled, and content in life, and no longer act on urges that cause harm to other people or yourself.

I asked him if my urges to manipulate or hurt people will go away once I’m recovered. He told me that the urges will be much less frequent, and that I won’t feel a strong need to act on them.

I asked him if once I’m recovered, if my brain will be the same as someone who doesn’t have narcissism. He told me that everyone has some degree of narcissism, it’s just that when it leads us to maladaptive behaviours, that’s when it becomes a problem. He told me that a recovered narcissist that has good behavioural regulation, is more healthy than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.

Everybody has urges that are not adaptive. Narcissists and non-narcissists. What matters is that we are not falling victim to these urges.

We can recover. We can change. I have faith in all of us.

Reduce suffering: The user seems to be in recovery from narcissism. They are asking their therapist about what this involves. The therapist explains that pathological narcissism is about using maladaptive methods to regulate self esteem. Recovery happens when the self esteem is regulated adaptively, when the person feels happy, fulfilled, and content in life. The therapist also says that once the person is recovered, their brain will be similar to someone who does not have narcissism.

Increase prosperity: Pathological narcissism is a problem that can be solved through therapy and behavioural regulation. Recovery looks different for everyone, but it typically involves adapting healthy methods to regulate self esteem. This will lead to a happier, more fulfilling life with fewer urges to cause harm to others or oneself. Everybody has some degree of narcissism, but it's only a problem when it leads to maladaptive behaviours. A recovered narcissist that has good behavioural regulation is healthier than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.

Increase understanding: Pathological narcissism is a mental disorder that is characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, excessive need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. People with pathological narcissism often have difficulty regulating their self-esteem, which can lead to impulsive and destructive behavior. Recovery from pathological narcissism can be difficult, but it is possible with the help of a therapist or support group. The most important thing for someone with narcissistic tendencies is to learn how to be healthy and happy without relying on external validation. This may include learning how to give and receive constructive criticism, setting realistic goals, and developing meaningful relationships.Pathological narcissism is a mental disorder that is typically characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a chronic need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others.
