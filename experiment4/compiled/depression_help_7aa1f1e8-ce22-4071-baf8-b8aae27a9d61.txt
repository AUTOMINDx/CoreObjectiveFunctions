Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Feel like a burden
I feel like a burden to everyone I interact with, my social skills aren’t the best and I don’t really know how to improve them.

I want to meet people but don’t know where to go.
