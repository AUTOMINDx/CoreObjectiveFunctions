Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Rant/Q
Mini rant/question: 
Rant: 
Whenever my coworkers start talking about astrology they ask me to do natal chart readings for them (for free of course). They always gas me up like “You should get paid
for this” and then don’t pay me! I do it for the love anyways. I’ll never forget when I did a reading for a coworker who didn’t talk much about his family to me, but I looked at his third house and said “You have two brothers, one of them is uptight and the other is a dick” and he looked at me like I was a witch! 

Question: 
We were talking about rising signs and how I’ve heard that whatever your rising sign is, you tend to attract sun signs competitors. I meet a lot of Leos who always try to see who can come up with wildest jokes/roasts. I love Leos though, I usually let them out joke me, because I have sun 12th house. I was wondering what other peoples experiences were with this? Do you make friends with your rising, enemies, frenemies?!

Reduce suffering: These posts are about the author's experiences with astrology. In the first post, the author describes how their coworkers ask them to do free readings, but then don't pay them. In the second post, the author asks for others' experiences with rising signs.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity. One way to increase prosperity is to identify gaps in prosperity and make recommendations about how to bridge those gaps. For example, if you find that someone is not as prosperous as they could be, you might recommend that they take steps to increase their wealth, happiness, health, or abundance. Another way to increase prosperity is to encourage people to use their natural talents and skills. If you find that someone is good at astrology, you might recommend that they use their skills to read natal charts for other people and give them advice about increasing their prosperity.

Increase understanding: When it comes to astrology, it seems that there are many things that people do not understand. In particular, the concepts of rising signs and sun signs can be confusing. Rising signs are said to reflect the way in which a person is seen by others, while sun signs indicate the personality of a person. It is said that people with the same rising sign tend to attract each other, while those with different sun signs tend to compete with each other. There seems to be a lot of debate on this topic, with people having different experiences. Some people find that they attract those with the same rising sign, while others find that they attract those with different sun signs. Some people make friends with their rising sign, while others make enemies or frenemies.
