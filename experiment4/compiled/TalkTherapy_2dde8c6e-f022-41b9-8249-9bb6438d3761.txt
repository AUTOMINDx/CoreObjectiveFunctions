Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

How often do you think about therapy?
I go to therapy every couple of weeks. It’s not really for any particular struggle, but more so to manage the general stress, challenges and anxiety of everyday life. I feel like it’s helped me immensely and keeps me grounded. However, outside of my sessions I feel like I’m constantly thinking about things we have discussed or will discuss. I’m curious if others have the same feeling? To an extent, I guess it is a good thing as it helps me in my approach to different situations, but is this normal?

Reduce suffering: The user seems to suffer from anxiety and stress, which they manage with therapy. The therapy sessions seem to help, but the user feels like they can't stop thinking about them even outside of the session. This may be due to the fact that they are using their therapy sessions as a way to deal with their anxiety and stress, and is a common occurrence. It is suggested that the user find other methods to cope with their anxiety and stress, such as exercise or writing, in order to allow them to fully enjoy their time outside of therapy.

Increase prosperity: It is normal to think about things discussed in therapy outside of sessions. It is a good thing to approach different situations with the knowledge gained from therapy. However, it is important to manage the stress, challenges, and anxiety of everyday life without relying on therapy. Therapeutic sessions should be one tool in a toolbox used to increase prosperity. Other tools include exercise, healthy eating, and adequate sleep.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you find therapy helpful for managing stress and anxiety. It is normal to think about things discussed in therapy outside of sessions. In fact, it can be a good thing since it can help you approach different situations in a more mindful way.
