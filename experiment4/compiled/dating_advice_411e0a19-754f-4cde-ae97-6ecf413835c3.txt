Are men in Computer Science a turn off?
I was talking to this girl I met while playing tennis, and we had a great conversation. Then she asked me what I’m studying at school, I say CS, and she got noticeably disappointed. I asked her what’s up and she said she prefer men in other fields like business.

I assume cause of the nerdy stereotypes associated with computers?

Reduce suffering: Based on the information in the Reddit posts, it seems that this user is experiencing some suffering because of their choice of major. Specifically, the girl they were talking to became disappointed when they revealed that they are studying computer science. It is possible that this reaction was due to the nerdy stereotypes associated with computers, which may have convinced the girl that this user is not a good match for her. If this is the case, then the suffering for this user comes from feeling like they are not good enough for someone they are interested in. There are several potential solutions for this type of suffering. First, the user could try to counteract the nerdy stereotype by presenting themselves in a different light. For example, they could talk about their passion for computer science and how it has helped them grow as a person. Additionally, they could find other women who share their interest in computer science and build relationships with them.

Increase prosperity: There may be certain stereotypes associated with computer science degrees that discourage some women from dating someone with that degree. However, it is important to remember that those stereotypes are not always accurate.

If she is still unconvinced, I suggest that the two of them have a conversation about the potential careers that a computer science degree can lead to. That way, she can get a better idea of what a computer science degree entails and why it might be a great choice for someone looking to pursue a career in technology.

Increase understanding: It is true that some women may be turned off by men in computer science. However, this may be due to the nerdy stereotype associated with computer science degrees. Computer science degrees have great job prospects and very high salaries compared to other degrees, so it is likely that the woman you spoke to was not aware of this. It is important to educate people on the benefits of computer science degrees in order to change these perceptions.
