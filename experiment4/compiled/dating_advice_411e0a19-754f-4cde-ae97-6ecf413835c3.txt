Are men in Computer Science a turn off?
I was talking to this girl I met while playing tennis, and we had a great conversation. Then she asked me what I’m studying at school, I say CS, and she got noticeably disappointed. I asked her what’s up and she said she prefer men in other fields like business.

Is that true? Can any woman chime in? CS degrees have great job prospects and very high salary compared to other fields, so why does she dislike it?

I assume cause of the nerdy stereotypes associated with computers?

Specifically, the girl they were talking to became disappointed when they revealed that they are studying computer science. It is possible that this reaction was due to the nerdy stereotypes associated with computers, which may have convinced the girl that this user is not a good match for her. If this is the case, then the suffering for this user comes from feeling like they are not good enough for someone they are interested in. There are several potential solutions for this type of suffering. First, the user could try to counteract the nerdy stereotype by presenting themselves in a different light.

This could help you avoid negative stereotypes and make yourself more attractive to potential romantic partners.

Increase understanding: There seems to be a perception that computer science degrees are unappealing to women. A quick internet search yields articles with headlines such as "Why Aren't More Women in Computer Science?" and "Are Men in Computer Science a Turn Off for Women?" One reason that some women may dislike computer science degrees is because of the negative stereotypes associated with them. For example, many people think of computer science degrees as being isolating and nerdy. In addition, some people believe that these degrees lead to difficult and inflexible careers. As a result, women may be less likely to pursue computer science degrees than men. However, it's important to note that this is changing. According to Google's report "The State of Women in Computing 2016," the percentage of women in computer science has been steadily increasing over the past few years. In fact, the report found that women now make up 26 percent of the field. And while this number is still lower than the percentage ofFor example, many people think of computer science degrees as being isolating and nerdy.
