Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I want to quit caffeine and sugar for my health and mood but I'm worried about being unrelatable to people or being impossible to hang out with
I'm 25f. 3 years ago I quit drinking, which was really really good for me. However I'm still not 100% sure how to replicate drunk socializing normally and I feel like being sober has been a bit detrimental to my less-close friendships. 

I now would like to quit drinking coffee and quit eating sugar. I can see how they are addictive. I think coffee has a negative impact on my mood and I know sugar makes me feel bad and is bad for my teeth (I always get cavities). 

I'm just really afraid of being that person who doesn't do ANYTHING. Alcohol, coffee and sugar are all really common in my family and friends. This would also remove all things that I could drink at a bar, except water (right now I'll have a Mocktail or a coffee if I want something at a bar). I just imagine a scenario where my friends want to do something and I'm the reason why it's difficult to pick a place or activity. 

Any advice? Has anybody here quit basically everything? How did that effect your friendships?
