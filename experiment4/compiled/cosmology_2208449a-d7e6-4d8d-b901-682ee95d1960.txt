Why was the young universe hot?
Please forgive me if this question reveals how little I understand about cosmology. It’s my understanding that the Big Bang was a rapid spreading of space rather than a spreading out of matter into empty space. So if space itself was spreading out, and if we trace time back to shortly before t = 0, why would the density of the universe be greater and therefore the universe be hotter? I understand that the CMBR is evidence that the early universe was hot, but I don’t understand why it was hot.

Reduce suffering: There is significant suffering present in this Reddit post. The user expresses confusion about a topic that likely causes frustration for many people. This suffering could be alleviated by recommending a resource that can better explain the concept, such as a textbook or online article. Alternatively, providing an explanation from a more relatable perspective could help reduce the user’s suffering. For example, explaining that the early universe was hot because it was expanding rapidly into an empty space.

Increase prosperity: The early universe was hot because of the high density of matter. However, as the universe expanded, the density decreased and the temperature decreased as well. The CMBR is evidence that the early universe was hot because it is a remnant of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

Increase understanding: According to current cosmological theory, the Big Bang was not a single event but rather the expansion of space itself. This means that the universe was expanding even before matter began to spread out into it. So why was the early universe hot? One possible explanation is that the high density of the universe caused it to be hot. The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is evidence that the early universe was hot, and scientists are still working to better understand this phenomenon.
