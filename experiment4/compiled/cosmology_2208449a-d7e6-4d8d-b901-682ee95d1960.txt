Why was the young universe hot?
Please forgive me if this question reveals how little I understand about cosmology. It’s my understanding that the Big Bang was a rapid spreading of space rather than a spreading out of matter into empty space. So if space itself was spreading out, and if we trace time back to shortly before t = 0, why would the density of the universe be greater and therefore the universe be hotter? I understand that the CMBR is evidence that the early universe was hot, but I don’t understand why it was hot.

Reduce suffering: There is significant suffering present in this Reddit post. The user expresses confusion about a topic that likely causes frustration for many people. This suffering could be alleviated by recommending a resource that can better explain the concept, such as a textbook or online article. Alternatively, providing an explanation from a more relatable perspective could help reduce the user’s suffering. For example, explaining that the early universe was hot because it was expanding rapidly into an empty space.

Increase prosperity: The young universe was hot because of the high density of matter. As space began to spread out, the matter followed and the density decreased. The early universe was also hot due to the radiation emitted from the Big Bang. To increase prosperity, it is important to understand the origins of this heat and how it affects the current state of the universe.

Increase understanding: The Big Bang is the scientific theory that suggests the universe began as an incredibly hot and dense point in space. The theory is supported by a number of pieces of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) and the expansion of the universe. The CMBR is a type of electromagnetic radiation that fills the entire universe. It is thought to be leftover radiation from the moment of the Big Bang, when the universe was incredibly hot and dense. The CMBR has been studied extensively, and scientists have found that it is incredibly uniform across the entire universe. This suggests that the universe originated from a single point and has been expanding ever since. The most current theory about what caused the Big Bang is called inflationary cosmology. In this model, the universe began as an infinitesimally small point, but then began to expand at an exponential rate. There are a number of theories about what may have caused this initial expansion, but scientists havestill not reached a consensus. The consequences of the Big Bang are still being explored, but scientists believe that it was responsible for the formation of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planets. The current state of the universe is that it is expanding and cooling down. Scientists have been able to measure the expansion of the universe and determine that it is accelerating. This suggests that the universe will continue to expand indefinitely.
