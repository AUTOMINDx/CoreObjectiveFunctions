Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Should I continue on intervening with a company after finding out their salary isn’t anywhere near COL?
So I was looking for a new engineering gig next year. I dislike like my current role with a passion. I threw a ton of applications to the wind and just sat back. 

The first place that responded was in San Diego. Never been there tbh but, heard it’s hell expensive. I did the first interview after a recruiter called me out of the blue. After passing and getting a second final set of interviews I went home and did a Google search of the salary. 

It’s about 90k issue is that I make about that much where I’m at now (middle cost of living area). 

The next set of interviews are technical questions. 

Should I go through with this interview for practice? They’d have to pay me the COL percent difference for me to take the job for me to even consider it so I know that I’m not gonna take this job.  

But will that look bad for a young engineer? I’m one year of college and not trying to burn bridges this quickly in the industry.

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user experiences a great deal of suffering due to the high cost of living in San Diego. They are making a similar salary to their current position, but the cost of living in San Diego is much higher. This creates a decision paralysis for the user, as they do not want to take a job that does not match their current salary but also do not want to burn bridges in their career.

Increase prosperity: It is important to increase prosperity for all individuals by ensuring that they are paid a salary that is reflective of the cost of living in their area. In some cases, this may require intervention on the part of the individual. If you are offered a job in a location where the cost of living is higher than your current area, it is important to negotiate a salary that is reflective of the increased cost of living. Doing so will ensure that you are able to maintain your current standard of living in the new area.

Increase understanding: The Reddit user asks if they should continue to intervening with a company after finding out that their salary is not anywhere near COL. COL refers to the cost of living. It is important to consider the cost of living when looking for a new job because it can affect your quality of life. If you are considering taking a job that is in a different location, it is important to do your research. Look into the cost of living in that area and see how it compares to the salary that the company is offering. It is also important to consider what this decision could mean for your career. Will taking this job look bad on your resume? Will it burn bridges with potential future employers? These are all things to think about before making a decision. Talk to professionals in your industry, or people who have already been in your position, to get their advice.
