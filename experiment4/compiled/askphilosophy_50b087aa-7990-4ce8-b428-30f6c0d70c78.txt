What is the reception of Sean Carroll in academic philosophy?
Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist who made a name for himself through advocacy of "naturalism" (i.e. physicalism, I think) through public lectures and a few high-profile debates since the "wave" of the 2000s that also included people like Dawkins and Harris. Apparently, he has "successfully" (for some measure) debated Craig, whom I consider an academic philosopher, and also Raymond Moody, who does have a PhD in philosophy but, for those in the know, is probably more familiar for his work as a doctor and researcher of near-death experiences.

I have a hard time understanding how he could score any points in a philosophical debate on an academic level, though if success is measured by convincing a lay audience, then I might imagine that he could sway a few minds. To me, he frankly seems to be sort of a whack; he claims that a particle physics has demonstrated that there is no "soul particle", and if there was, then particle accelerators should be able to detect it, that the soul would have to be "energy" that would be converted to heat energy and dissipate upon death, and other such strawmen that I think serious academic-level proponents of dualism or idealism have already worked out and around in the past 200 years. Now, I'm not saying that physicalism being wrong is a conclusion (even though that is my personal opinion), but he seems to enter the battlefield awfully ill-equipped (or just makes facetious claims about "soul particles" because of sheer spite against accepting dualism even conceptually).

Is there any reception of this guy in academic philosophy? Does anyone consider his challenges (which are, arguably, not his alone, but standard fare) to be a problem for dualism or idealism?   


edit: Oh lord, so many downvotes! We're having a civilized discussion here, I'm surprised how many nerves this must have struck.

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user appears to be struggling with the reception of Sean Carroll in academic philosophy. They express that Carroll is not well-respected by academics in the field, and speculate that this may be because he is not very well-educated in philosophy. They recommend that those interested in the matter read around on the topic before making up their own mind.

Increase prosperity: In order to increase prosperity, it is important to have a clear goal in mind and to be open to new ideas. Sean Carroll is a physicist and cosmologist who has made a name for himself through his advocacy of naturalism. While some may consider him ill-equipped to debate on an academic level, he may be successful in swaying the opinions of a lay audience. It is important to be well-informed about the opposing argument before entering into any debate. In order to increase prosperity, it is important to be willing to learn and grow.

Increase understanding: There has been mixed reception to Sean Carroll's work within academic philosophy. Some commentators, like Carroll himself, view him as working in the naturalist tradition of philosophy of science. Others argue that he employs a broadly metaphysical framework in his work and that, as a result, his views are not naturalist at all. A central point of contention is Carroll's embrace of dualism â€“ the view that there are two substances or types of reality, mental and physical. Some argue that this amounts to idealism, the view that only mental entities exist. Others maintain that Carroll preserves materialism by arguing that physical entities are composed of mental properties. There is also disagreement about the role of idealism in Carroll's thinking. Some see it as playing a central role while others argue that it is only a minor part of his overall view.Some commentators, like Carroll himself, view him as working in the naturalist tradition of philosophy of science.
