Reduce suffering: This subreddit appears to be for people who have questions about history that are too simple, short, or silly to warrant their own post. The questions posted in this thread appear to be serious in nature, but the answers provided are often humorous. This could be a fun place to ask historical questions that you're not sure about, because the users are likely to provide thorough and informative answers.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity, such as increasing wealth, happiness, health, and abundance. In order to increase prosperity, it is important to identify any gaps in prosperity and make recommendations about how to bridge those gaps. One way to increase prosperity is by increasing economic growth. This can be done by encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation, and by investing in education and infrastructure. Another way to increase prosperity is by reducing poverty. This can be done by providing opportunities for economic advancement, such as education and job training, and by providing social services such as healthcare and food assistance. Finally, another way to increase prosperity is by creating a conducive environment for businesses. This can be done by reducing taxation and regulation, and by improving the infrastructure.
