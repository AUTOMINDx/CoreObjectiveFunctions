Simple/Short/Silly History Questions Saturday, December 04, 2021
Welcome to our Simple/Short/Silly history questions Saturday thread! 

This thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post. 

So do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask? Well, today is your lucky day. Ask away!

Of course all our [regular rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index) still apply and to be just that bit extra clear: 

- Questions need to be historical in nature.
- Silly does **not** mean that your question should be a joke.

Reduce suffering: This subreddit appears to be for people who have questions about history that are too simple, short, or silly to warrant their own post. The questions posted in this thread appear to be serious in nature, but the answers provided are often humorous. This could be a fun place to ask historical questions that you're not sure about, because the users are likely to provide thorough and informative answers. However, I would not recommend asking joke questions here, as the other users might not find them funny.

Increase prosperity: To increase prosperity, it is important to be mindful of your actions and the consequences they may have. Make sure to think about the impact your decisions will have on not only yourself, but also on those around you. Look for ways to improve communication and cooperation, and be generous with your time, resources and knowledge. When possible, try to make compromises and see things from other people's perspectives. These simple steps can help to create a more prosperous and harmonious world for all.

Increase understanding: There are many history questions that are too simple, short, or silly to warrant their own post. However, that doesn't mean they don't deserve answers! Here are a few of the best (or worst) simple history questions that we could find: -What were Ancient Egyptian beds like? -Who was the first president of the United States? -What is the origin of the phrase "rule of thumb"? -How many cups are in a gallon? -When did the Hundred Years War start and end? These are just a few examples of short, silly questions with straightforward answers. If you're curious about any other historical minutiae, be sure to search for it online! There's a good chance that somebody has already asked it.For example, when did the Hundred Years War start and end? The Hundred Years War started in 1337 and ended in 1453.
