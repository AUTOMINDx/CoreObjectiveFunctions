Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

How are girls supposed to act when they orgasm?
I like moaning a lot during sex, but this guy I was hooking up with told me that girls shouldn’t be that vocal because then how is he supposed to know when he’s doing something that feels good if I’m already making noise. He also said I seemed like I was overreacting/being dramatic when I came. 
Needless to say, I’m not gonna hook up with him again because I don’t wanna be with someone who makes me insecure of how I act when I’m enjoying something BUT I am genuinely curious if I act unusually or not

Reduce suffering: This user experiences a great deal of suffering caused by other people. The first example is from someone who they were hooking up with and told them that they shouldn't moan because it would be difficult to know what feels good if they are already making noise. The second example is from someone who was told they seem overreacting and being dramatic when they came. This type of criticism can be extremely damaging to someone's self-esteem. In both cases, the suffering is caused by someone else. In cases like this, it is important to have a supportive network of people who will make you feel good about yourself. Additionally, therapy may be beneficial in helping the person understand why they receive this type of criticism and how to cope with it.

Increase prosperity: In order to increase prosperity, it is important to be confident in your actions and be vocal about what feels good. Don't worry about what others may think - if you are enjoying yourself, let loose and express that through your actions and vocalizations. This will help you to increase your own prosperity and will likely lead to a more enjoyable experience for both you and your partner.

Some may moan or scream in pleasure, while others may be quite silent. Some may become quite vocal and demonstrative, while others may remain quite subdued. There is no wrong way to react, as each woman's experience is unique to her. What should I do if I'm not moaning during sex? If you're not moaning during sex, there's no need to worry. Many women do not make any noise whatsoever during orgasm. Alternatively, some women may only moan softly. There is no correct or incorrect way to behave; it's entirely up to you and what feels best for you. Is it bad to be too vocal during sex? No, there is no bad way to be vocal during sex. Some women find it very pleasurable to express their enjoyment vocally, while others prefer to remain silent. Itis entirely up to you and what feels best for you. How can I know if I'm overreacting or being dramatic when I orgasm? There is no one right answer to this question. Every woman's experience is unique and different. If you're concerned that you may be overreacting or being dramatic, ask your partner for their opinion. They may be able to offer some insight and help you to determine if your reaction is normal for you.
