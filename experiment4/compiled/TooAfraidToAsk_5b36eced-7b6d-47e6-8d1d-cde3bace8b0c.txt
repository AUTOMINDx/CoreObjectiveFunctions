How are girls supposed to act when they orgasm?
I like moaning a lot during sex, but this guy I was hooking up with told me that girls shouldn’t be that vocal because then how is he supposed to know when he’s doing something that feels good if I’m already making noise. He also said I seemed like I was overreacting/being dramatic when I came. 
Needless to say, I’m not gonna hook up with him again because I don’t wanna be with someone who makes me insecure of how I act when I’m enjoying something BUT I am genuinely curious if I act unusually or not

Reduce suffering: This user experiences a great deal of suffering caused by other people. The first example is from someone who they were hooking up with and told them that they shouldn't moan because it would be difficult to know what feels good if they are already making noise. The second example is from someone who was told they seem overreacting and being dramatic when they came. This type of criticism can be extremely damaging to someone's self-esteem. In both cases, the suffering is caused by someone else. In cases like this, it is important to have a supportive network of people who will make you feel good about yourself. Additionally, therapy may be beneficial in helping the person understand why they receive this type of criticism and how to cope with it.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to achieve prosperity, and everyone may have a different definition of what it means to them. In this case, the poster seems to be concerned about whether they are acting in a way that is pleasing to their partner during sex. It’s important to remember that everyone is different, and what may work for one person may not work for another. If you are concerned about how you are behaving during sex, it may be helpful to talk to your partner about what they enjoy, and ask for feedback. There is no shame in wanting to please your partner and make sure that both of you are enjoying yourselves.

Increase understanding: There can be a lot of pressure on individuals to behave in a certain way during sex, and this Reddit user is curious about how they should act when they orgasm. Some people may enjoy moaning loudly during sex, while others may find it distracting or disruptive. It can be helpful to listen to feedback from partners during sex so that you can continue to give them what they want and make them feel good. This Reddit user's partner told them that they seemed like they were overreacting when they came, which made them feel insecure. If you have any concerns about your sexual behaviour, it is best to talk to your partner about it directly.
