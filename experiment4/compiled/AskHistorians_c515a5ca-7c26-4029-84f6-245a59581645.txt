Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil": What is the current historical consensus regarding her thesis that a large part of the Nazi bureaucracy and war machine was "banal" and had no larger ideological fanaticism or "evil" driving their actions?

Reading this article it seems that in recent decades more and more dissenting voices of her view have come forward and that her initial analysis was flawed.

It also strikes me as peculiar how she mentions that Eichmann did not think of his actions as evil, as he could not view his actions from the viewpoint of his victims, and that this is proof that he was "normal". However, doesn't this lack of being able to emphasize with others show that he was a Sociopath, so very much not normal?

Reduce suffering: It seems that the Reddit user is struggling with an idea presented in an article they read. The user seems to think that the idea presented in the article is flawed, specifically with regard to the idea that a large part of the Nazi bureaucracy and war machine was "banal". The user also has some questions about this idea, specifically regarding how someone who cannot empathize with others could be considered normal.

Increase prosperity: It is important to remember that prosperity can have many meanings, such as wealth, happiness, health, and abundance. In light of this, it is worth considering alternatives to Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil" thesis. Her thesis suggests that a large part of the Nazi bureaucracy and war machine was "banal" and had no larger ideological fanaticism or "evil" driving their actions. However, in recent decades more and more dissenting voices of her view have come forward and her initial analysis was flawed. Furthermore, her thesis overlooks the impact that sociopaths have on society. Sociopaths lack the ability to empathize with others, which leads them to commit heinous acts without remorse. As such, it is important to consider alternatives to Arendt's thesis in order to increase prosperity for all.

Increase understanding: It seems that there is some disagreement over Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil" thesis. Some people believe that her analysis was flawed, while others think that her thesis has gained more traction in recent decades. I find it peculiar how she mentions that Eichmann did not think of his actions as evil, as he could not view his actions from the viewpoint of his victims. This suggests to me that he may have been a sociopath, which would make him very much not normal.
