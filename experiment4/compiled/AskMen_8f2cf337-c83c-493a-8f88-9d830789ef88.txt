The proper technique is to cup the bottom of your balls, push up, hold for a second, and do it for a second time just in case. He's got no piss in his pants for the last 7+ years with this black magic. Make sure to do it AT THE BOTTOM part of your balls, which is at the base closest to your butthole. If you’re just lifting your balls up, it won’t do anything. Take care of your wand brothers. Cheers!
