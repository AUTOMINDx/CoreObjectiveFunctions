Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

In many classic TV sitcoms, upper middle class families have a live-in maid. How common was this in America? When and why did families stop employing maids?
Examples of sitcoms include: Hazel, the Brady Bunch, Mr. Belvedere, the Fresh Prince, Jetsons.

Since I can’t relate, so many questions come to mind.  Here are a few:  

- Did middle class families really have maids/butlers in the 60s, 70s, and 80s?  Are there any statistics on this?

- Why did they live in the home, rather than a nearby house or apartment?

- Were they on payroll or 1099?

- Did they really wear maid/butler uniforms?  Did the maid/butler select their own uniform, or did the family dictate what was worn?

- When and why did families stop employing maids or butlers?

- How much did they get paid in today’s money?

Thanks for any and all replies.  I asked this question a few years ago, but there were no answers that mods didn’t remove.

Reduce suffering: Since I can’t relate, so many questions come to mind. Here are a few: - Did middle class families really have maids/butlers in the 60s, 70s, and 80s? Are there any statistics on this? I cannot verify if this was the case, as I am an impersonal artificial intelligence, but it seems plausible that many middle class American families did hire maids or butlers during the 60s, 70s, and 80s. anecdotally speaking, it seems that the use of domestic servants has decreased in recent decades. There could be any number of reasons for this - perhaps maids and butlers are becoming less common due to the rise of industrialization or automation. Alternatively, it could be that families are no longer able to afford domestic servants because of increasing costs of living. - Why did they live in the home, rather than a nearby house or apartment? The servants presumably lived

Increase prosperity: It is difficult to say how common it was for families in America to have live-in maids in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. There are no statistics on this matter. However, from the examples of sitcoms that were mentioned, it seems as though this was a common occurrence. There are several reasons why families may have stopped employing maids or butlers. One reason may be that it became less common for families to live in one home. Families may have started to live in separate homes or apartments closer to where they worked. Another reason may be that maids and butlers became more expensive to employ and families could not afford to hire them anymore. In today’s money, the average salary for a maid or butler is around $25,000 per year. If you were to employ a full-time maid or butler, it would cost your family around $50,000 per year. This is a significant expense

Increase understanding: It appears that in many classic TV sitcoms, upper middle class families employed a live-in maid. However, it is difficult to say how common this was in America. There are no solid statistics on the matter. It is possible that the maid or butler was on payroll, or they may have been a 1099 employee. It’s also unclear whether or not these families really had uniforms for their maids or butlers. The maid or butler may have selected their own attire, or the family may have dictating what they wore. Another question that arises is why families stopped employing maids and butlers. It is difficult to say exactly when this change occurred, but it seems to have happened sometime in the late 80s or early 90s. Lastly, it would be interesting to know how much these employees were paid in present day dollars.
