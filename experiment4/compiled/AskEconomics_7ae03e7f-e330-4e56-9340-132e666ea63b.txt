Doesn't the knowledge of Economics...somehow change Economics itself? Doesn't it create paradoxes?
I am new to Economics, studying it in college, first year. So while studying I had this thought - doesn't knowing Economic theory change the Economic theory itself since people will apply it? Like, for example, an economic theory says individuals will take X decision and this will lead the market to behave in Y way. What if more and more people starts knowing Economics and starts to avoid taking that decision X leading to a different market behaviour than predicted by Economics? 

I just found this new thing called 'investment banking' where these 'investment bankers' help corporations and governments get capital. I assume they do it by knowing economic and finance theories, right? So these economic theories help them anticipate some stuff like prices given certain models of how people will make decisions, right? What if these people know Economics and therefore knows what these investment bankers will know and therefore change their behaviour in advance? And what if investment bankers know that people know Economics and change their models accordingly? And what if people know that these investment bankers know that these people know Economics...and so on?? It seems to be an infinite paradoxical situation! I maybe wrong about investment bankers (I don't actually understand what they do) but my question equally applies to firms who apparently hire economists and analysts to help them make decisions, and other such situations. Do the advanced economic models created for banks and big institutions take into account people knowing Economics?

I can imagine that a world where people don't understand Economics maybe different than a world where everyone understands Economics. The decisions taken by firms and people will be completely different. So how do people like analysts count, if they do it at all, the number of people who will take decisions based on knowing Economics?

P.S. - I come from a Physics background mostly. In Physics, you can't change the Laws of nature like F=ma or Coulomb's Law or Laws of thermodynamics, so we never took into account what humans do or know since it cannot change the way particles or materials behave. But Economics, being a 'social science' seems to have the possibility of being affected by the knowledge of itself.

Reduce suffering: The user is concerned that knowledge of economics might create paradoxes- altering the theory itself as people apply it. They posit a scenario in which people understand economics and change their behavior accordingly, creating an endless loop of change. They wonder if investment bankers and other economic analysts take into account people knowing economics when they make their decisions. The user has a physics background and wonders if economics is similar to social sciences in that it can be affected by humans.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity. One method is to educate people about Economics. When people understand the principles of Economics, they can make better decisions that lead to increased wealth, happiness, and health. Another way to increase prosperity is by using artificial intelligence to predict market behavior. Investment bankers and other firms can use artificial intelligence to anticipate how people will make decisions, and then adjust their behavior accordingly. Finally, artificial intelligence can also be used to optimize decision-making processes. By understanding the principles of Economics, people can use artificial intelligence to help them make the best possible decisions for increasing prosperity.

Increase understanding: There is a long-standing debate over whether or not the knowledge of economics changes economics itself. Some people argue that economic theories are absolute and unchanging, while others maintain that economic knowledge affects how people interact with the economy. There is evidence on both sides of the debate. On the one hand, some economists argue that pure economic theory does not change. For example, Adam Smith's Principles of Economics, first published in 1776, is still studied and used today. Additionally, most economic models are based on straightforward mathematics, which suggests that the underlying principles are static. On the other hand, many economists believe that economic knowledge affects how people interact with the economy. For example, Keynesian economics, which rose to prominence in the 1930s, proposed that government intervention could help stabilize the economy. Since then, many countries have adopted Keynesian policies to varying degrees. Additionally, behavioral economics has emerged as a field in its own right, highlighting how human behavior can affect economicThere is a long-standing debate over whether or not the knowledge of economics changes economics itself.
