Interview Tip #1
“What are your current salary requirements?” 

Don’t answer this question with a number. Don’t. Under any circumstances. Don’t do it. It’s a very common question for HR or the hiring interviewer to ask during an interview. It’s also all things considered a reasonable question to ask from their side, but don’t give them a number. Here’s how you respond. “I’m certainly flexible if the job is a good fit which I think it will be. What is the range you have budgeted for this position?” 9/10 times they will respond telling you what you’ll end up making.

Say a job is going to pay in the range of $17-$23 an hour. If you answer with $16 you’ve sold yourself short. If you say $30 you’re going to come across as a crazy person. Now you know to talk about your skills and what you bring to the company and shoot for that upper range. 

Information is power. Get them to give you the information you need and go from there. If they ask online to fill out a section that asks how much you want don’t fill it out. If it makes you fill it out just put $1.

Edit: Everyone is saying this is bad advice because you need to do research beforehand and have a good range in mind. Obviously, do that as well. Don’t go in completely blind. But at the end of the day this is the best way not to sell yourself short.

Reduce suffering: The user appears to be struggling in their job search. They may be seeking advice on how to negotiate their salary. The artificial intelligence recommends that the user not give a number, and instead wait for the interviewer to offer information about the pay range for the position.

Increase prosperity: This Reddit user offers some advice on how to respond when asked about salary requirements in an interview. They suggest not giving a number, but instead saying that you are flexible if the job is a good fit. They provide information on how to respond if the job pays in the range of $17-$23 an hour. If you answer with $16 you’ve sold yourself short, but if you say $30 you’re going to come across as a crazy person. The user recommends talking about your skills and what you bring to the company instead. This is good advice, especially because it puts the power in your hands. You can then negotiate based on the information you have received.

Increase understanding: Current salary requirements are often a question asked during an interview. It is a reasonable question for the interviewer to ask, but it is important not to give a number. When responding, you can say that you are flexible if the job is a good fit, and then ask what the range for the position is. This will give you an idea of what to shoot for. If you already have an idea of what you want, don't be afraid to aim high. Information is power, so get the interviewer to give you the information you need.
