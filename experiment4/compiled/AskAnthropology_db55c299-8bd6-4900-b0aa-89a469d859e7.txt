How does this sub feel about attributing modern political philosophies to pre-modern/historic societies?
Just a student wondering how to reconcile attempts to compare past societies with current political philosophies. 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that in order to garner legitimacy, proponents of certain philosophies attempt to tie the maxims of their movements with seemingly natural human societal processes. For example, using trade and private/personal property in pre-modern/historic societies (Rome, Egypt, Songhai, Tuareg, Malawi are among some names I've personally heard mentioned) to validate capitalism, or inversely, communal ownership of the means of production in agricultural/pastoral/hunter-gatherer economies to validate socialism. It would probably become more relevant the closer one got to the present, but I'm not convinced.

Just hearing alot of attempts among my as equally unprofessional peers to justify beliefs by claiming X or Y society is \[*insert political philosophy*\], therefore, I'm right because look how well they did and we should do more of that etc.

Reduce suffering: This Reddit user seems to be questioning the legitimacy of certain political philosophies because they are trying to tie them to pre-modern/historic societies. It seems that this user is troubled by the fact that people are using these societies as justification for their beliefs, without looking at the actual evidence. It is possible that the user is concerned about the validity of these philosophies, or that they are concerned about the way in which these ideologies are being presented. In either case, it would be helpful for this user to look at the actual evidence and make their own conclusions.

Increase prosperity: There seems to be a trend among certain groups of people to use examples of pre-modern/historic societies to justify their political beliefs. However, it is not clear that these comparisons are valid. In order to increase prosperity, it may be helpful to look at the actual evidence and arguments for these philosophies, rather than using historical societies as support.

Increase understanding: It seems that in order to garner legitimacy, proponents of certain philosophies attempt to tie the maxims of their movements with seemingly natural human societal processes. For example, using trade and private/personal property in pre-modern/historic societies (Rome, Egypt, Songhai, Tuareg, Malawi are among some names I've personally heard mentioned) to validate capitalism, or inversely, communal ownership of the means of production in agricultural/pastoral/hunter-gatherer economies to validate socialism. Proponents of these philosophies believe that by understanding how these societies operated, they can better understand the validity of their philosophies. However, it is important to remember that these societies were not perfect, and that there are many complexities which cannot be captured by comparing them to modern societies.
