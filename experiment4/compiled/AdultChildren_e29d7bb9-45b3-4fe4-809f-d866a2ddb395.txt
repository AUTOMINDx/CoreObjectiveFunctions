My dad finally agreed not to drink at Christmas
Have been NC with my dad since last February. This man gaslights me and is so absorbed in his own denial it's impossible to talk to him about his issues. But I just received email (the only way he is allowed to contact me) that he won't drink on christmas if I agree to come. 

I'm feeling torn. I didn't expect him to come around this fast, and I also hate the concept of only being able to see him on his terms (ex: if he decides to drink on christmas next year so I wouldn't see him). I doubt he believes he has any sort of problem, he just wants to see me. 

I am very torn on what to do. He also said it's fine if I'm not ready. I just wish I had a different dad so I didn't have to worry about this. What do you guys think

Reduce suffering: The user is experiencing conflict and anxiety as a result of their strained relationship with their father. The father has agreed not to drink alcohol on Christmas if the son agrees to visit, but there is doubt about whether or not the father actually believes he has a problem. The son wishes he had a different father so that he wouldn't have to worry about this conflict. The user could try to talk to their father about the situation and why they are feeling conflicted. If the father is not willing or able to acknowledge the issue, then setting boundaries for how and when they interact with each other may be helpful. The son could also find support from friends or family members who can listen and offer advice.

Increase prosperity: Based on the information provided, it seems that the individual is hesitant about whether or not to visit their father for Christmas. There are many considerations to take into account when making this decision, including the father's past behavior and the potential for positive change. If the individual decides to visit their father for Christmas, it is important to set boundaries and establish expectations ahead of time. It is also crucial to have a support system in place in case things go wrong. If the individual does not feel safe or comfortable visiting their father, they can always opt to stay away. The most important thing is that the individual feels good about their decision and is willing to stand up for themselves.

Increase understanding: There is no one "right" way to deal with a parent who drinks, as each situation is unique. However, there are some general tips that may be useful. First, it is important to remember that you cannot change your parent's behavior, and attempting to do so will only lead to frustration on your part. It is also important to maintain healthy boundaries with an alcoholic parent. Establishing and enforcing boundaries can be difficult, but it is important to remember that you are not responsible for your parent's drinking and you cannot fix their problems. If you are able to, it may be helpful to talk to other family members or friends about what you are going through, as they may be able to offer support. Finally, if you feel unsafe or like your parent's drinking is causing harm to yourself or others, it may be necessary to seek professional help. If you are dealing with a gaslighting parent, the key thing to remember is that their behavior is not your faultIf your parent is engaging in gaslighting behavior, they may be trying to manipulate you into thinking that their behavior is normal or that you are the one who is at fault. This can be extremely confusing and emotionally draining, but it is important to remember that their behavior is not your fault. You do not deserve to be manipulated and for someone to try and control how you feel is wrong. Family members and friends can be a great support system during this time, and seeking professional help may also be beneficial.
