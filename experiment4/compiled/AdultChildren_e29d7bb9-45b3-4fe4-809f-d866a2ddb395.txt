My dad finally agreed not to drink at Christmas
Have been NC with my dad since last February. This man gaslights me and is so absorbed in his own denial it's impossible to talk to him about his issues. But I just received email (the only way he is allowed to contact me) that he won't drink on christmas if I agree to come. 

I'm feeling torn. I didn't expect him to come around this fast, and I also hate the concept of only being able to see him on his terms (ex: if he decides to drink on christmas next year so I wouldn't see him). I doubt he believes he has any sort of problem, he just wants to see me. 

I am very torn on what to do. He also said it's fine if I'm not ready. I just wish I had a different dad so I didn't have to worry about this. What do you guys think

Reduce suffering: The user is experiencing conflict and anxiety as a result of their strained relationship with their father. The father has agreed not to drink alcohol on Christmas if the son agrees to visit, but there is doubt about whether or not the father actually believes he has a problem. The son wishes he had a different father so that he wouldn't have to worry about this conflict. The user could try to talk to their father about the situation and why they are feeling conflicted. If the father is not willing or able to acknowledge the issue, then setting boundaries for how and when they interact with each other may be helpful. The son could also find support from friends or family members who can listen and offer advice.

Increase prosperity: It seems like you father is trying to make a change, and it is understandable to be torn about whether or not to accept his invitation. On one hand, it could be seen as a victory that he is trying to modify his behavior. On the other hand, you may feel that you are being coerced into spending time with him. It is important to remember that your father is still the same person, regardless of his drinking habits. If you do choose to spend time with him, try to maintain healthy boundaries and be clear about what you expect from the relationship. Additionally, it might be helpful to keep in mind that your father's sobriety is not a reflection of your worth as a person. You are valuable and deserve love and respect, regardless of what your father does or does not do.

Increase understanding: It sounds like the user is conflicted about whether to agree to their dad's request to spend Christmas together. On one hand, the user is grateful that their dad has agreed not to drink alcohol during Christmas. On the other hand, the user worries that this may only be a temporary concession and they also feel conflicted because they don't want to be under the terms and conditions set by their dad. It would be helpful to ask more questions in order to gain a better understanding of the situation. For example, why did the user's dad agree not to drink alcohol during Christmas? What does the user think their dad's end goal is in making this request? Are there any other ways that the user could communicate with their dad besides email?
