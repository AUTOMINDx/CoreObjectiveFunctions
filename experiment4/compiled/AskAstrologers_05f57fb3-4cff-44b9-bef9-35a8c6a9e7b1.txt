Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Psa this sub is called ASK ASTROLOGERS, not project about your crappy ex.
Earlier someone made a post with placements of her partner. Said placements were mostly Gemini, Aries, Scorpio and Taurus (IIRC).

An overwhelming majority of the comments were "omg sis RUN!!!!!" and "cheater!! Fuckboy!!! Will break your heart!!" And "omg my ex had several of these placements I wish I could warn every woman to stay away".

Your toxic ex does not speak for everyone in existence with said placement. No ACTUAL astrologer would ever say this. Does everyone with a Sag stellium like Ted Bundy turn out to be a serial killer? no! Same logic here! 

No placements are inherently cheaters or more loyal. My ex was a Cancer Venus, the steryotypically most loyal Venus sign, and was anything BUT loyal. An Aries Venus in the 12th house with a trine to Saturn will be a wildly different person than an Aries Venus in the 5th house square Uranus. Any ACTUAL astrologer would know this and would make a point of this. 

Generally speaking, those with their Venus (or other personal planets) in Aries/Gemini/Sagittarius aren't "non committal/cheaters". They simply don't want to be in a relationship that falls into a stale and boring routine after years together. And there is literally nothing wrong with that. Life is long, who the f wants to be with someone boring? I have none of the mentioned Venus signs, and being bored is a huge dealbreaker for me. 

Any placement can cheat and any placement can be loyal.

Again, this sub is called ASK ASTROLOGERS. Maybe some of you should create your own little pop astrology sub where you can project about your trash ex all day, and leave this sub for us actual astrologers. It's doing a huge disservice to the complexity and beauty of astrology. No wonder a good majority of the population views astrology as a joke. 

I can definitely tell transit Mercury is in Sagittarius ðŸ™„ðŸ¥³.

Reduce suffering: The user's ex is spoken of in a negative light by most of the commenters. This may be due to the fact that their partner has placements in Gemini, Aries, Scorpio, and Taurus, which are all suspected to be cheater signs. It is possible that this user is suffering from a broken heart, due to their partner's infidelity. It is also possible that this user is simply projecting their own negative emotions onto their ex. They may benefit from seeking out an astrologer to help them understand their situation better.

Increase prosperity: In order to increase prosperity, it is important to be positive and have a growth mindset. Believe that you can achieve your goals and take action towards them. Be grateful for what you have and stay focused on your goals. Surround yourself with people who are supportive and share your same values. practice meditation or mindfulness to stay in the present moment and focused on your goals. eat healthy foods and exercise regularly to maintain your health and well-being. know your worth and don't let anyone take advantage of you. trust your intuition and follow your heart. stay positive, focused, and grateful to increase your prosperity.

Increase understanding: 1. "What are the placements for a cheater?" There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the placements of Venus will vary depending on the individual. However, some general placements for those who are more likely to cheat include Venus in Aries, Gemini, and Sagittarius. These signs represent people who are more likely to take risks and be spontaneous in their romantic relationships, which can lead to cheating. Additionally, individuals with Venus in these signs may be less likely to value loyalty and commitment in a relationship. 2. "What are the placements for a loyal partner?" On the other hand, someone with Venus in Taurus, Cancer, or Capricorn is more likely to be a loyal partner. These signs represent individuals who are more likely to value commitment and stability in their romantic relationships. Additionally, people with Venus in these signs are often more cautious and less likely to take risks, whichIn general, someone with Venus in Taurus, Cancer, or Capricorn is more likely to be a loyal partner. These signs represent individuals who are more likely to value commitment and stability in their romantic relationships. Additionally, people with Venus in these signs are often more cautious and less likely to take risks, which can lead to less cheating.
