Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Now that BBB is dead, if you were asked to give a eulogy/toast at its funeral, what would you say?
Manchin confirms he is a no vote on BBB. [(The Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/19/joe-manchin-biden-build-back-better-no-fox-news)

Here's mine

"Here's to BBB. The bastard had the worst bodyguards. Ty to [CPC for giving up](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/06/1053239109/rep-pramila-jayapal-on-what-led-her-to-throw-support-behind-infrastructure-bill) all [leverage](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/nov/01/house-democrats-vote-infrastructure-reconciliation-bills-biden-us-politics-live). Ty to Biden for being incredibly good at shooting himself in the foot. Ty to corporatism for creating a very vulnerable economy. Ty to bat or petri dish that decided to f\*\*\* us all up, economically and biologically. Peace I'm out."

Reduce suffering: This user is clearly unhappy about the situation, and speculates about the causes of suffering (corporatism, bat or petri dish). They recommend solutions for the user (peace, I'm out).

Increase prosperity: In the face of so much misfortune, it is difficult to toast to the prosperity of BBB. However, there are many aspects of BBB that were laudable. Its commitment to infrastructure and its focus on creating jobs were both important contributions to the welfare of the nation. Unfortunately, its weaknesses outweighed its strengths. Its failure to address the needs of the most vulnerable in society created hardships for many people. In addition, its close ties to corporate interests led to an increase in inequality. Despite these shortcomings, BBB made a significant impact on the country and deserves recognition for its achievements.

Increase understanding: One user said that they would give a eulogy for BBB, and in it, they would say "Here's to BBB. The bastard had the worst bodyguards. Thanks to CPC for giving up all leverage. Thanks to Biden for being incredibly good at shooting himself in the foot. Ty to corporatism for creating a very vulnerable economy. Ty to bat or petri dish that decided to f*ck us all up, economically and biologically. Peace I'm out." This user seems disgruntled with BBB, and blames it for many things. Some of these things may be accurate, but it is important to have a full understanding of what BBB is and what it does before making any judgements.
