Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I found out this year at the age of 43
I apologize for the length, but I found this place recently and wanted to share as your stories have helped me tremendously. 

I felt for years there was something wrong with me. I’d tell people my brain didn’t work properly, or that I should probably be diagnosed with a condition such as bipolar disorder.

&amp;nbsp;

I tried so many things to try to feel normal or good about myself. I became addicted to porn, video games, caffeine, alcohol, and at one time drugs. Nothing worked. Just temporarily made me feel better until they didn’t. I gave them all up and briefly felt better. Then the feelings returned. “But I’m not addicted anymore. Why do I still feel so bad?”

&amp;nbsp;

I felt suicidal multiple times. It got to the point where I had the pills and the booze in my hand and was all set to take them and end it. Something inside made me stop. I am not sure what.

&amp;nbsp;

I was a virgin until I turned 30. Not because I didn’t have the chance but because I never felt worthy enough of anyone’s love. Any time I got close to someone I would run away. In some cases literally run away.

&amp;nbsp;

I started and quit job after job. Always falling out with bosses or managers. Never being able to settle anywhere. Never saved any money or planned for the future because I didn’t want to live to old age.

&amp;nbsp;

I moved out of home aged 21, but financial situations due to quitting jobs got the better of me and so I moved back in with my parents and stayed there until I was 32.

&amp;nbsp;

I never passed my driving test so I was totally reliant on my dad to take me places. He hates driving and often drives drunk so that was fun.

&amp;nbsp;

Then I finally made it out. I got a degree on my own with no help. I travelled the world. I became an ESL teacher overseas. I met my future wife. I finally learned how to drive in my 40’s. 

&amp;nbsp;

We eventually had a daughter together about a year and a half ago. It was our daughter who made me seek therapy because I wanted to “fix” myself and make sure she didn’t go through the same things I did. 

&amp;nbsp;

Therapy revealed the “trauma”. That’s a word I am struggling to come to terms with, but it helps because now I know what I am and what I am not. 

&amp;nbsp;

No hugs. No I Love you. No interest in anything I was doing. No shared fond moments. No real encouragement. Alcohol. Angry. Shouting. Yelling. Tension. Drama. Always feeling on edge. Growing up wanting to be big enough so I could fight my father and hurt him. 

&amp;nbsp;

And now as a 43 year old I understand. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I mention this to my parents they pretend that it never happened.  It wasn’t that bad. “He loved you in his own way”. “We did the best we could.” Luckily I have a sister and she remembers everything too.

&amp;nbsp;

My therapist tells me that they may have tried their best, but their best wasn’t enough for me.
