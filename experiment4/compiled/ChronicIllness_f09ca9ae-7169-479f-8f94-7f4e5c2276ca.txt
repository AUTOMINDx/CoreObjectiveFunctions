Cleaning advice :)
What are your tips for low effort cleaning? Cleaning takes so many spoons when I'm constantly tired and my joints hurt so I was looking for ways to take some physical labor out of the tasks. I got a light weight cordless vaccum that has been a huge help but I'm still wearing myself out doing laundry or attempting to clean the bathroom. My main problem is bending down bc it hurts my joints and I get really dizzy (POTS). So picking up laundry from the floor sucks but cleaning my tub is impossible. I know its probably bad for the environment but I'm looking for some stronger cleaning solutions so I'm not on my knees scrubbing the bottom of my tub. something i could put on and let it sit and rinse away or at least do less vigorous scrubbing. I'm very interested in hearing how your cleaning has evolved while living with chronic illness. Any advice is welcome &lt;3

Reduce suffering: The user in this post seems to be suffering from chronic pain, which makes performing everyday tasks difficult. The user asks for advice on how to make cleaning easier, specifically mentioning that bending down to clean surfaces or pick up laundry is painful and difficult. The user also mentions having a condition called POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, which can cause dizziness and low blood pressure. One potential solution for the user might be to try a steam cleaner, as this would take some of the physical labor out of the task. Another solution could be to get a helper to assist with lighter tasks such as laundry, or to find a more ergonomic way to complete these tasks, like using a lightweight cordless vacuum cleaner.

Increase prosperity: One way to increase prosperity is by using less physical labor when cleaning. This can be done by using a cordless vacuum cleaner, which is lighter and easier to maneuver than a standard vacuum cleaner. Additionally, consider cleaning solutions that do not require vigorous scrubbing, such as a diluted bleach solution that can be left on and will rinse away. Alternatively, there are products that can be sprayed on and will loosen dirt and grime so that it can be easily rinsed away. These products can be especially helpful for those with chronic illness who find it difficult to bend down or are susceptible to dizziness.

Increase understanding: It can be difficult to clean when you are chronically ill. You are not alone in this struggle. Some suggestions for making cleaning easier include using a light weight cordless vaccum, taking breaks, and using stronger cleaning solutions. I hope that this advice is helpful to you.
