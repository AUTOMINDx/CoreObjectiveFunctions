Cleaning advice :)
What are your tips for low effort cleaning? Cleaning takes so many spoons when I'm constantly tired and my joints hurt so I was looking for ways to take some physical labor out of the tasks. I got a light weight cordless vaccum that has been a huge help but I'm still wearing myself out doing laundry or attempting to clean the bathroom. My main problem is bending down bc it hurts my joints and I get really dizzy (POTS). So picking up laundry from the floor sucks but cleaning my tub is impossible. I know its probably bad for the environment but I'm looking for some stronger cleaning solutions so I'm not on my knees scrubbing the bottom of my tub. something i could put on and let it sit and rinse away or at least do less vigorous scrubbing. I'm very interested in hearing how your cleaning has evolved while living with chronic illness. Any advice is welcome &lt;3

Increase prosperity: There are a few things that can be done in order to increase prosperity while living with chronic illness. One suggestion is to try and take some of the physical labor out of cleaning tasks, by using a light weight cordless vacuum for example. Another suggestion is to pick up laundry from the floor instead of bending down to do so, as this can be difficult and painful for those with chronic illness. Additionally, using stronger cleaning solutions can help make cleaning tasks easier and less vigorous.

Increase understanding: Low effort cleaning tips: 1. Make a plan: before you start cleaning, make a list of the areas you want to focus on and the tasks you need to complete. This will help keep you organized and focused. 2. Use the right tools: make sure you have the right tools for the job – this will save time and effort. For example, use a vacuum cleaner with a detachable hose to clean stairs and tight spaces, or an all-purpose cleaner to quickly tackle dirt and dust. 3. Multi-task: tackling several tasks at once can help speed up the cleaning process. For example, while the oven is heating up, wipe down surfaces in the kitchen. 4. Take your time: rushing through a cleaning job will only make it harder – take your time and work systematically. 5. Delegate: if you have family or friends around, ask them for help – it’s always easier to clean when there’s moreLow effort cleaning tips can differ based on the person and the level of cleaning they are willing to do. Usually, it is recommended that one makes a plan of what they want to clean, using the right tools for the job, multi-tasking, taking their time, and delegating if needed. For example, if someone wants to clean their bathroom, they should start by gathering their supplies such as a broom, mop, buckets, rags, toilet brush, and cleaner. Once everything is gathered, they can start by making a note of what needs to be done such as sweeping the floor, cleaning the shower/bathtub and sink, toilet scrubbing, and mirror/countertop wiping.
