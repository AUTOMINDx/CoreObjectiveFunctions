AITA for yelling at my boyfriend and telling him he acts like a needy 5 year old
I've been applying for jobs recently. This morning my boyfriend  "Ian" was still sleeping and my phone rang.  It was one of the jobs that I applied for and they asked if I had a minute to talk. I said sure and went in my office and shut  the door,  I had been in my living room anyways but noise carries more from the living room and I was trying to be quiet. 

Well right after I closed my office door Ian got up and I heard him walking around.  Then he opened the door and came in.  He asked "who is that?" "Oh! Is that your mom? Tell her hi". I was still talking to the hr person and he said "Is that Mary? Who is that?" 

I got up and waved my arm (trying to wave him away) while still trying to answer the HR person's questions, and went back in the living room.   He followed me and said "is that Kim? Ask if her and Kyle want to go for lunch with us later".  

So I went in the kitchen instead,  he followed me AGAIN and started unloading the dishwasher.  I started walking back to my office and the HR lady said she wanted me to come in for an interview Thursday at one. So I said "Thursday at one works great". While she was explaining how to get there, get in the building and everything Ian comes running and says "no no no! not Thursday today! I work Thursday ". I thanked her and hung up.

  I was annoyed.  I said "that was about a job that wasn't Kim, you're worse than a nosey 5 year old that needs attention ". 

He said "well you could have just told me who it was". 

I said "yea in the middle of a call I'll  say "hold on my bf wants to know who I'm talking to "". 

He said "well you could have wrote it down or something, I was just curious, I get up and you're already on the phone Sorry. You don't have to be mean about it." He's done this crap before and it's  annoying. 

 So I just stayed in my office and have been checking emails and futzing around.  I'm just irritated because if that Hr person heard him I would have looked unprofessional and he was disrupting my concentration  (I have Adhd) and made it harder for me to focus on what she was saying. Maybe I shouldn't have snapped like that and I overreacted.  

AITA

Reduce suffering: The user is frustrated with their boyfriend, Ian, for barging into the room while they are on the phone and distracting them from their conversation. They feel that he is acting like a "nosey 5 year old that needs attention." They speculate that he does this often and finds it irritating. The user recommends that Ian be more mindful of other people's space and to not interrupt them while they are speaking.

Increase prosperity: It sounds like you become irritable when your concentration is disrupted. This can be a challenge for people with ADHD, as well as anyone trying to focus on a task. I recommend designating specific times for Ian to ask about the calls, rather than asking continually throughout the call. This way, you can have more uninterrupted time to focus on the conversation. You may also want to consider speaking with him about how his behavior is impacting your ability to concentrate and indicating that it would be helpful if he could refrain from disrupting you in this way.

Increase understanding: Based on the posts, it sounds like the user is frustrated with her boyfriend, Ian. It seems that Ian is constantly interrupting her and is overly-curious about who she is talking to on the phone. The user feels that Ian is being nosy and disruptive, which impacts her ability to focus on important conversations. From what is described, it does not seem like Ian is behaving in a respectful manner. He is not considering how his behavior might be impacting his partner. If this behavior continues, it may be worth exploring why Ian feels the need to be so intrusive and what can be done to help him change his behavior.
