[Serious] Gynecologists of Reddit: Why is the average gynecologist reluctant to pursue an endometriosis diagnosis/dismissive of pain?
Age: 27, female, 5’1. Endometriosis. Symptoms were extremely painful debilitating cramps during the first day of my cycle along with vomiting, fever, and almost passing out. 

I am one of many patients who have suffered endometriosis for YEARS before finally having enough and needing to find a specialist who would take my pain seriously and get me my diagnosis. This is such a common theme with woman with endo and it’s really sad. Extreme period cramps are not normal and shouldn’t be overlooked. Since I was 15 (diagnosed endo at 27) I have expressed my pain many times and the only answer they gave me was birth control. Once birth control was barely helping my pain, they only suggested me taking it to where I no longer get a period or get it every 3 months. I chose the 3 month option but I eventually asked for higher pain meds, since I did not wish to fully stop my period and naproxen barely helped me, and got denied as if I was some junkie just looking for pills. I’ve asked about the possibility of endo many times and got dismissed. They didnt want to do any surgeries unless I was ready for kids, which is ridiculous because it can continue to grow and cause serious permanent damage if not removed. It wasn’t until this year I had to find a specialist to get taken seriously, and she scheduled a lap for me right away without hesitation. Endo was found and removed via excision and for the first time in my life during my period, no more pain. My life was significantly changed after this, I felt like it was a miracle honestly. But why couldn’t this have been done years ago? I am just disappointed and feel like I was gaslighted this whole time, and this is so extremely common amongst others with endo. Is it lack of training? Do they want to just move on to the next patient? I’m genuinely curious.

Edit: I was not expecting this much engagement with this post, but thank you so much everyone who took the time to share your stories and opinions!! It’s so interesting to see everyone’s different views and experiences. And thank you so much for the silver and other awards!! You all are amazing! For those still struggling btw, you are strong, and you got this. Never ever give up on finding the treatment/diagnosis you deserve, and I mean that for any condition, not just endo.

The user's experience is unfortunately common for those with endometriosis. The gynecologists should be better trained in how to diagnose and treat endometriosis.

Increase prosperity: Many patients with endometriosis suffer for years before receiving a diagnosis. This is due in part to gynecologists who are reluctant to pursue a diagnosis or dismissive of pain. This is not normal and should not be overlooked. Gynecologists should be better trained to identify and treat endometriosis. Patients should not hesitate to seek a second opinion if their gynecologist does not take their pain seriously.

Increase understanding: Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This can cause pain, especially during menstruation. Many women with endo report having years of pain before finally getting a diagnosis. There are many possible reasons for why gynecologists might be reluctant to pursue a diagnosis of endometriosis. One possibility is that they may not be aware of the latest research on endometriosis and how it can cause pain. Another possibility is that they may not be comfortable performing surgery to remove the endometrial tissue. Some gynecologists may also be dismissive of pain complaints from patients, thinking that the pain is not significant enough to warrant a diagnosis or treatment. If you are experiencing extreme pain during your period, it is important to speak up and let your gynecologist know. You deserve to have your concerns taken seriously and to receive an accurate diagnosis. There are many treatments available for endometriosis, including
