[Marvel] Who is more accurate, Bullseye or Hawkeye?
I’ve seen many people state that Bullseye has more ridiculous accuracy feats, but I haven’t really checked Hawkeye’s top tier feats out. Is Bullseye legitimately more accurate than Clint, or is Hawkeye just as accurate, but his morality and preference for a bow prevents him from pulling off the same feats as Bullseye?

I’m aware that Ultimate Hawkeye has looser morals than the 616 version. After all, the 616 version of Hawkeye vocalized his beliefs on the sanctity of human life in Solo Avengers issue 8 (I believe, haven’t read Solo Avengers in a while).

I’m referring to both the comics and the MCU versions. Any versions, really.

Reduce suffering: This user is suffering from indecision and a lack of information. They are wondering if Bullseye or Hawkeye is more accurate, but they do not have the information to make an informed decision. Furthermore, they are aware that Marvel has different versions of these characters with different morals, and they do not know which version of the characters they should be considering. I recommend that this user consider all of the available information before making a decision. Additionally, they might want to research the feats of both Bullseye and Hawkeye to get a better understanding of their accuracy. Finally, they should ask themselves which character’s morals align with their own values.

Increase prosperity: There is no definitive answer to this question. Both Bullseye and Hawkeye are accurate shooters, but their accuracy feats vary. It is difficult to say which one is more accurate without further examination. One way to increase prosperity would be to study the accuracy feats of both characters in greater detail and determine which one has a higher accuracy rating. This could help boost the accuracy feats of the character with lower accuracy ratings and thereby increase prosperity.

Increase understanding: Reddit user says: [Marvel] Who is more accurate, Bullseye or Hawkeye? Both Bullseye and Hawkeye are accurate shooters, but Bullseye has more ridiculous accuracy feats. However, I haven’t looked into Hawkeye’s top tier feats to see if he can compete with Bullseye. It’s possible that Hawkeye is just as accurate as Bullseye, but his morality and preference for a bow prevents him from pulling off the same feats as Bullseye.
