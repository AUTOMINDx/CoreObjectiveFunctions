Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I started an elimination diet 2 weeks ago, and my day-to-day anxiety has decreased by 90%
Please note that I am not a doctor, mental health professional or nutritionist. I am just someone who has suffered from a lot of anxiety over the last 5 years, and have had the most symptom-free 2 weeks in years since I started this elimination diet.

What I eliminated: 

* packaged junk food (cookies, potato chips, crackers, etc)
* grains (all breads, pastas, flour)
* anything with added sugar (with an exception for honey which I add to my morning coffee)
* diet cola (this was a big one for me since I was consuming about 2 liters per day of the stuff)
* most dairy (but will make an exception for salad dressings, or occasional parmesan cheese)

What I now eat:

* 1 cup of coffee in the morning, with soy milk and honey
* salads
* chicken, some red meat in moderation
* sweet potatoes
* cous cous, lentils
* nuts
* fruit
* vegetables
* eggs
* drinking lots of water instead of my diet cola habit

What I suspect may have been happening before was that my bad diet was screwing up my blood sugar levels and/or blood pressure as a result I was getting a lot of weird physical symptoms (occasional light-headedness, chest pains, migraines, vertigo, etc) which was then triggering my anxiety which was then triggering more health symptoms and it was a vicious cycle. Or perhaps I had a gluten sensitivity and that was the problem.

That, or my diet cola addiction was putting so much caffeine and/or chemicals into my system and that was causing my phsyical symptoms which was triggering anxiety and on it went. 

I also have an itchy/dandruffy scalp and rosacea problem, and that has not gone away, but I am hoping I may see some improvement after a couple months on this new lifestyle/diet.

Anyway, I am posting this here in hopes that it may help someone else. Like I mentioned earlier, I am not a medical professional and am aware there are many non-diet reasons people suffer with anxiety, but I really think this may help others out there like me. Take care.

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user reports a significant decrease in anxiety after starting an elimination diet. The user suspects that the bad diet was causing physical symptoms, which were triggering the anxiety. The user recommends the diet to others who suffer from anxiety.

Increase prosperity: If you are struggling with anxiety, I suggest eliminating processed foods, grains, added sugars, and diet cola from your diet. Replace these foods with healthy alternatives such as salads, chicken, sweet potatoes, cous cous, lentils, nuts, fruit, and vegetables. If you have a gluten sensitivity, I recommend eliminating gluten from your diet. If you have an itchy/dandruffy scalp or rosacea problem, I suggest consulting a doctor to see if there is a non-diet related cause.

Increase understanding: There are a variety of elimination diets that can be helpful for people with anxiety. The most common is the gluten-free diet, which can help relieve symptoms in people who have a gluten sensitivity. Other elimination diets that can be helpful for anxiety include the dairy-free diet and the sugar-free diet. The benefits of an elimination diet are that they can help identify foods that trigger your anxiety symptoms. This is important because once you know what foods cause your symptoms, you can work to avoid them. An elimination diet can also help you to eat more nutrient-rich foods and to improve your overall health. What to eat on an elimination diet varies depending on which diet you are following, but generally speaking, it is best to focus on whole, unprocessed foods. Some good options include fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and healthy fats. It is important to avoid processed foods and sugary snacks, as these can contribute to inflammation and gut health problemsSure! Some specific foods that are known to trigger anxiety symptoms include caffeine, alcohol, artificial sweeteners, processed foods, and sugary snacks. Additionally, foods that are high in histamines, such as aged cheese, fermented foods, and processed meats, can also trigger symptoms in people with a histamine intolerance.
