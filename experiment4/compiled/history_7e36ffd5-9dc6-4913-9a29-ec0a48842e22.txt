Knights and Squires in the Last Duel
Hello there. I recently read the book The Last Duel (haven't seen the movie yet) and it raised a question about knighthood/nobility in the 14th-15th centuries.

In the book, Jean Carrouges is said to be a Squire until the age of around 50, before being Knighted after the campaign in Scotland. But his father was a Knight. Le Gris was a Squire until the duel I think, where he was knighted so they would be on equal terms. But they both held lands, manors, political offices/military commands etc. 

I had previously been under the impression that a Squire was essentially an "apprentice knight" but after doing some light reading on the subject I am not so sure. I was wondering, is Squire a title? As in the lowest "rung" if Nobility, or some kind of functionary office? Is it hereditary? What makes you eligible to become a knight if you are a Squire? Is military service, regardless of birth, the prerequisite for a Knighthood? Basically, how does the rank of knight, squire, relate to noble birth/common birth etc.

I know that answers obviously change with what century/place you're talking about, so I suppose I am specifically asking in the 14th-15th centuries (1350-1450 say?) around about "Western Europe" (England, France, Italy, HRE, etc) But if anyone has some extra tidbits to add about other areas (Bohemia, Hungary/Croatia, Poland) that would be interesting as well.

Reduce suffering: This user is evidently interested in the process of becoming a knight in the Middle Ages. They ask about the difference between squires and knights, and wonder if there is a specific formula for ascending from one rank to the other. There was no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the process of becoming a knight varied from place to place and time to time. In general, however, one could become a knight either by birthright or by demonstrating achievements in battle or some other area of life. There was no specific formula, but military service was often seen as the key qualification for knighthood.

Increase prosperity: The system of knighthood in the 14th-15th centuries was complex, with many layers of titles and responsibilities. A squire was not simply an "apprentice knight", but held a position of some importance in society. He was not necessarily of noble birth, but could be knighted for military service or other accomplishments. There were no specific qualifications to become a knight, but it was generally seen as a high honor. There were many benefits to being a knight, including wealth and land holdings. However, there were also responsibilities, such as military service and governance of lands. The rank of knight was seen as a marker of high status and prosperity.

Increase understanding: Reddit user's question about knights and squires in the 14th-15th centuries raises several interesting points. In order to increase understanding of this topic, some gaps in knowledge need to be filled. First, it is important to understand the difference between a knight and a squire. A knight is a man who has been awarded a knighthood, usually for military service or heroism. A squire is an apprentice knight, someone who is training to become a knight. Second, it is unclear what constitutes eligibility to become a knight. Some say that military service is the only prerequisite, while others claim that birth into a noble family is necessary. In practice, it seems that either of these factors could be important, depending on the situation. Finally, it should be noted that the rank of knight and squire can vary from place to place and from century to century. Therefore, any generalizations about this topic should be taken with a grain of salt
