Knights and Squires in the Last Duel
Hello there. I recently read the book The Last Duel (haven't seen the movie yet) and it raised a question about knighthood/nobility in the 14th-15th centuries.

In the book, Jean Carrouges is said to be a Squire until the age of around 50, before being Knighted after the campaign in Scotland. But his father was a Knight. Le Gris was a Squire until the duel I think, where he was knighted so they would be on equal terms. But they both held lands, manors, political offices/military commands etc. 

I had previously been under the impression that a Squire was essentially an "apprentice knight" but after doing some light reading on the subject I am not so sure. I was wondering, is Squire a title? As in the lowest "rung" if Nobility, or some kind of functionary office? Is it hereditary? What makes you eligible to become a knight if you are a Squire? Is military service, regardless of birth, the prerequisite for a Knighthood? Basically, how does the rank of knight, squire, relate to noble birth/common birth etc.

I know that answers obviously change with what century/place you're talking about, so I suppose I am specifically asking in the 14th-15th centuries (1350-1450 say?) around about "Western Europe" (England, France, Italy, HRE, etc) But if anyone has some extra tidbits to add about other areas (Bohemia, Hungary/Croatia, Poland) that would be interesting as well.

Reduce suffering: This user is evidently interested in the process of becoming a knight in the Middle Ages. They ask about the difference between squires and knights, and wonder if there is a specific formula for ascending from one rank to the other. There was no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the process of becoming a knight varied from place to place and time to time. In general, however, one could become a knight either by birthright or by demonstrating achievements in battle or some other area of life. There was no specific formula, but military service was often seen as the key qualification for knighthood.

Increase prosperity: In order to increase prosperity, it is important to have a clear understanding of what prosperity means to you. For some people, wealth and material possessions are the key indicators of prosperity. For others, happiness and health may be more important. It is also important to have a plan for how you will achieve prosperity. Setting and working towards goals are an essential part of any plan for prosperity. Finally, it is important to be patient and persistent in your efforts. Prosperity does not happen overnight, but with hard work and determination, you can achieve great things.

Increase understanding: A knight is a mounted warrior who served his lord by fighting in battle, while a squire was a young man who was training to become a knight. The qualifications for becoming a knight were that the squire be of noble birth, be skilled in combat, and be able to ride a horse. The process of becoming a knight usually began when the squire was about seven years old, and he would serve his lord and lady for many years before he was finally knighted. A commoner was someone who was not of noble birth, while a nobleman was someone who was born into nobility. Nobility could be inherited or conferred by the king or queen, and it gave the person certain privileges, such as the right to bear a coat of arms and to attend court.The meaning of "heritable" is that it can be passed down from one generation to the next. For example, nobility is a heritable status, meaning that if one parent is a nobleman, the child will also be a nobleman.
