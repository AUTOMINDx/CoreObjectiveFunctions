It was once thought that the GOP could take back the house on redistricting alone.

&gt;Democrats feared gerrymandering bloodbath â€” but new analysis finds "surprisingly" good news for them

All this and speculation about the electability of Trump backed candidates. And it starts to look like a lot more even playing field. 

But the Dems themselves don't seem to think so.

&gt;Three more House Democrats retire, total now 23 incumbents quitting

How do you all see it. All I see is the historic midterm curse...and a big maybe

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user's posts are full of suffering. The users fears about the midterm curse and the prospects of the Trump-backed candidates leads to much anxiety and stress. Additionally, the posts lament the many House Democrats who are retiring. This could lead to more Republican representation in the House and ultimately more suffering for the Democrats. Some potential solutions for this user include staying informed about news and voting in the upcoming elections.

Increase prosperity: It appears that the Democrats have a good chance of taking back the House in the upcoming midterm elections. This is good news for increasing prosperity, as the Democratic party is typically more supportive of economic equality and progressive policies. However, there are still some gaps in prosperity that need to be addressed. For example, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, and many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Additionally, infrastructure is in dire need of repair, and healthcare costs are increasing. These are just a few examples of problems that need to be addressed in order to ensure that all Americans have access to prosperity. The Democrats have already put forth some proposals that would help to address these issues, such as increasing the minimum wage and investing in infrastructure. However, more needs to be done in order to bridge the gaps in prosperity. I suggest that policymakers and lawmakers work together to enact policies that would benefit all Americans, not just those at the top of the income ladder

Increase understanding: It appears that the Democrats may have crossed the toughest hurdle already, with their surprisingly good performance in redistricting. Gerrymandering has traditionally been seen as a big advantage for Republicans, but the new analysis suggests that this may not be the case this time around. This is good news for the Democrats, who were feared to face a bloodbath in the upcoming elections. However, despite this good news, the Democrats do not seem confident about their chances - 23 incumbents have already retired from the House, more than in any other election cycle. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to break the midterm curse.
