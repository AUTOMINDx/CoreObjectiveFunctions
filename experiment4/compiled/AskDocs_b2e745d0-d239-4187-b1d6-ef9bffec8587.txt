Red spot on grandson's face.
My grandson (boy) is 16 months old.  He lives a few states away.  I visited him the week of November 11.  I noticed a red spot on his face about the size of a pencil eraser.   My daughter just sent me a picture.   It's larger and rough.   Again, he is 16 months old, weighs 19 pounds and is 30 inches long.   He does not take any medication.  There are no other spots anywhere on his body,  he does not rub it or act like it bothers him in any way.   Anyone know what this is?

Reduce suffering: The redditor's grandson has a red spot on his face. The spot is larger and rougher than an eraser-sized spot and there are no other spots on his body. The redditor does not know what the spot is and asks for input from other users. The red spot could be caused by a number of things, such as allergies, a rash, or acne. If the grandson is taking no medication and there are no other symptoms, then it is likely that the spot is benign. However, if the grandson is exhibiting any other symptoms, such as itchiness or discomfort, then it is best to have him examined by a doctor.

Increase prosperity: It is possible that your grandson has a benign lesion called a cherry angioma. These are small, red spots on the skin that are caused by an accumulation of blood vessels. They are harmless and usually disappear over time. However, it is important to have them checked by a doctor to make sure.

Increase understanding: Based on the information in the post, it is difficult to determine what the reddish spot on the grandson's face may be. It is possible that it could be a type of rash, but without further information it is hard to say for certain. If the spot has been growing in size or if the grandson experiences any pain or irritation from it, then it would be best to have him seen by a doctor.
