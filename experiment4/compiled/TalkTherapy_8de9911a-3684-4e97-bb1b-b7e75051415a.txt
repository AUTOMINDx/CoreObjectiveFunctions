Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Anyone else miss their therapist so much it hurts?
I'm crying in between sessions because I miss them so much.  All I want is to be in that therapy room receiving their attention, support and care. To be able to be myself and emotionally vulnerable with them. It hurts that I only get to see them a few times a month.

It doesn't help that I have no support system in my life. They are the only person I talk to outside of work.

I don't have therapy again for 11 days and it feels unbearable. I hate how dramatic I sound but it is what it is.

Does anyone else feel this? How do you cope?
