Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I live in an area that was hit bad by the tornado (Kentucky). I’ve been without electricity since December 10. My utility company sent me this message yesterday and I’m not exactly sure what all of this means:
From utility company: 

“Your service is an old direct buried service (not in conduit) that was installed years ago. It was damaged by the tornado. You will need to contact an electrician and have it replaced to code (with conduit) before we can restore power to your home. I believe the guys attempted to make contact this morning and could not reach anyone to speak to or they would have explained it to you at that time (that is coming in second hand from the field). You can call in the morning and speak to an engineer or go ahead and procure an electrician and they will know what to do.”


Is this going to cost an arm and a leg? Will I likely be displaced for longer?
Or is this relatively easy? Why wouldn’t the utility company do this/put me in conduit? What is conduit?!

Any feedback would be great. I’m calling an electrician shortly. 

Extra info: I am on my own transformer. This is in Bowling Green, KY.

** UPDATE ** thank you all for the helpful &amp; kind  comments. An electrician came by earlier today &amp; I should have electricity in the next 48 hours. Fingers crossed. Thank you

Reduce suffering: The user describes experiencing significant suffering as a result of damage to their electric service caused by a tornado. There is a sense of confusion and isolation, exacerbated by the user not understanding what the utility company is telling them. The user reports that they are going to have to hire an electrician, but is anxious about the potential cost and how long the work will take. Some potential causes of the suffering are lack of knowledge and confusion, financial stress, and worry about the future. Potential solutions include providing more information to the user, community resources such as financial or job assistance, and scheduling a timeframe for the work so that the user has some certainty.

Increase prosperity: It seems that this individual's community was hit hard by a tornado, and as a result, the individual's electricity has been out since December 10. The individual reports that the utility company has told them they need to replace their service, as it is an old direct buried service that was not installed in conduit. The individual asks for feedback about what this means and whether it will be costly or displacing. It is difficult to say for certain without knowing more about the situation, but it seems likely that this replacement will be costly and displacing. It is important to remember that when disasters like this occur, communities often come together to help those who are affected. In this case, it may be helpful to reach out to friends, family, or your community for support during this time.

Increase understanding: From the utility company's message, it sounds like your service is an old direct buried service (not in conduit) that was damaged by the tornado. The damage will need to be fixed by an electrician to code (with conduit) before the utility company can restore power to your home. It sounds like the guys attempted to make contact this morning and were not able to reach anyone, so they left a message. You can call in the morning and speak to an engineer, or go ahead and procure an electrician and they will know what to do. It's unclear if having the service fixed will be expensive or if it will take longer than expected. Displacement is also a possibility, but it sounds like there is some hope you will have power within 48 hours. It's always helpful to get clarifying information from experts, so please feel free to ask any questions you have about this situation in the comments below!
