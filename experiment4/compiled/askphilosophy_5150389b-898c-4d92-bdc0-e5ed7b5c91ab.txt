Is there a school of thought discussing the anxiety of being seen?
Relative newbie to anything philosophy. 

I’ve been wondering about the fear of being seen by others ever since I learned a bit about the fear of envy. I think a facet of it would encompass the fear of envy and measures people take to avoid it, but I wonder if there’s some broader discussions of forms of malicious gaze that also address being seen as something that may not be based on envy. 

I’m curious how a “fear of being seen” impacts self perception and perception of others individually and broadly. 

Are there philosophers who examine this?

Reduce suffering: The user is experiencing anxiety due to the fear of being seen. This fear may be based on envy, as the user suggests, or on a fear of being judged or seen in a negative light.

Increase prosperity: There are many schools of thought discussing the anxiety of being seen. Some philosophers examine this fear of being seen and its impact on self-perception and the perception of others. This can have a broad impact on prosperity. If you are fearful of being seen, you may take measures to avoid envy, such as hiding your wealth or downplaying your accomplishments. This can limit your prosperity. You may also feel self-conscious and uncomfortable in social situations. This can lead to decreased happiness and decreased abundance.
