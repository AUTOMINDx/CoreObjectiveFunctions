What is the average day like for an engineer?
This question is mainly for mechanical engineers, but any other engineers are free to answer as well if they‚Äôd like to.

When I imagine engineering I think of; 50% sitting down and doing hardcore calculus, 30% tinkering around in CAD programs, and the other 20% doing meetings etc. Is this way of thinking accurate? (I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs probably not).

And one more question. I know that most engineers nowadays use CAD programs to simulate and design stuff. How much of your projects/designs are just simply up to your creativity?, and how much of the design is based off of the math and stuff beforehand?

Any feedback would be appreciated.üëç

Reduce suffering: This Reddit user may be feeling overwhelmed by the demands of the engineering profession. The first paragraph suggests that the user feels that they are not living up to others' perceptions of what an engineer should be like. This may be due to a lack of confidence in their abilities, or it may be due to actual stressful demands of the job. The second paragraph asks for feedback on the accuracy of the user's preconceived notions about engineering, and this might be a way to gain some understanding of what parts of the job are more challenging. The last paragraph asks for feedback on the level of creativity involved in engineering. This might be another way of gauging how comfortable the user feels with their current skillset.

Increase prosperity: To increase prosperity, I recommend spending more time on creative tasks and less time on mathematics. This will allow you to be more productive and satisfied with your work. Additionally, using CAD programs to simulate and design projects can be helpful in increasing prosperity.

Increase understanding: The different types of engineering include civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and chemical engineering. A typical day for a mechanical engineer might include designing new products, researching materials, and working with computer-aided design (CAD) software. The average salary for a mechanical engineer is about $85,000 per year. The math used in engineering is primarily calculus and linear algebra. CAD software helps engineers visualize how a product will look and how it will function, which can help reduce errors and speed up the design process.A typical day for a mechanical engineer might include designing new products, researching materials, and working with computer-aided design (CAD) software.
