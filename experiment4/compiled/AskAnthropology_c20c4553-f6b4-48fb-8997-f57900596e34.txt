Struggling with what career path to take
Hello everyone, I’m 21M and I’ve always been interested in social issues and especially languages cultures geography and ethnicities from around the world I know a great deal about my home country just from my own curiosity I tend to research a lot on these types of topics, I first did business in university for two years then left it but now I am an electric apprentice currently working around Europe its good job and after four years it’ll pay very well, I also studied for a month this year of social science but had to drop out due to travelling it was a night time course but the hours didn’t work with it which was a huge shame as it would of been great for me but what I’m trying to say is I’m stuck between pursuing my hobby as a career or doing a trade which I don’t mind it’s not like I hate it It’s interesting I have good fun with co workers but I feel like by not pursing the one thing I’m so interested in I’m gonna regret it in years to come I really don’t know what to do I also feel like if I was to do an Anthropology degree it would take 4 years and feel like I’ll be old finishing at 26 I know it’s stupid ! The degree sounds so interesting too.

I also want to know as I’ve seen a lot on Reddit people saying it’s a “useless degree with no jobs after it”? Is this true or not ? I don’t know what career I would even like after it I feel like it may have lots of options if someone could explain to me what typical careers are after it please let me know I just want to know more about it incase I do decide to go for it next year thank you very much to anyone who replies !

Reduce suffering: The user is suffering from indecision about their career path. They are interested in social issues, languages, cultures, and ethnicities, but they are worried that they will regret not pursuing this interest as a career. They also wonder if an Anthropology degree would be a wise investment. Reddit users have told them that an Anthropology degree is a "useless degree with no jobs after it." The user is seeking more information to help them make a decision. I recommend that the user speak with a career counselor to get more specific advice about their options. I also advise the user to do more research on the career prospects for Anthropology graduates.

Increase prosperity: You seem unsure of what career to pursue. I recommend you consider your interests and skills and find a career that matches those. It is important to be passionate about your work in order to be successful. You should also think about what you want to accomplish in life and find a career that will help you reach your goals. You should also research the job market and find a career that has good prospects.

Increase understanding: There are many different careers that relate to social issues. A few examples include social worker, human resources coordinator, fundraiser, and community organizer. Social workers help people who are dealing with difficult situations, such as poverty, abuse, or mental illness. They provide counseling and support, and work to find resources for their clients. Human resources coordinators help companies hire and fire employees, and develop policies related to employee benefits and compensation. Fundraisers raise money for charities and other organizations. They may work for a particular charity or for a company that raises money on behalf of several charities. Community organizers work to improve the quality of life in their community. They may advocate for change at the local level or work to provide services that people in the community need. There are also many careers that relate to languages, cultures, geography, and ethnicities.
