Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Is everyone else just exhausted by covid/ afraid there will be no end in sight?
Let me preface this by saying I’m 100% vaccinated and I’m getting the booster very soon so I’m not just posting this stir anything up.

Im visiting family a few states over from mine and recently found out that a few of my close friends have tested positive. I’m vaccinated so it didn’t really worry me but my mom is freaking out (her parents/my grandparents are pretty old and I would say vulnerable) and I’m not trying to be cold or anything because obviously I love my grandparents but at this point it’s making me feel like this shit is never going to end. I’m going to go get tested and if I test positive I’m just going to have to quarantine. But now I’m thinking every major holiday there’s just going to be a crazy amount of cases all the time. I’m just exhausted from this and I always feel like when things start getting better everything just blows up again.

Have you guys gotten a point where you’re feeling like there’s no end in sight? How should I handle this situation.
