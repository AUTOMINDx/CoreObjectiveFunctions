Is everyone else just exhausted by covid/ afraid there will be no end in sight?
Let me preface this by saying I’m 100% vaccinated and I’m getting the booster very soon so I’m not just posting this stir anything up.

Im visiting family a few states over from mine and recently found out that a few of my close friends have tested positive. I’m vaccinated so it didn’t really worry me but my mom is freaking out (her parents/my grandparents are pretty old and I would say vulnerable) and I’m not trying to be cold or anything because obviously I love my grandparents but at this point it’s making me feel like this shit is never going to end. I’m going to go get tested and if I test positive I’m just going to have to quarantine. But now I’m thinking every major holiday there’s just going to be a crazy amount of cases all the time. I’m just exhausted from this and I always feel like when things start getting better everything just blows up again.

Have you guys gotten a point where you’re feeling like there’s no end in sight? How should I handle this situation.

Increase understanding: The internet search query, "Covid and end in sight" yields a variety of articles with conflicting information. Some say that the end is in sight and we are on the brink of a cure. Others state that there is no end in sight for Covid-19 and it is only going to get worse. What does this mean for those who are vaccinated? Will they still contract the virus? According to the World Health Organization, "vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and reduce the severity of disease." However, there is still some risk of contracting the virus if you are vaccinated. In a study done by The Lancet, it was shown that "the vaccine was highly efficacious against severe pandemic illness (93% efficacy), moderate pandemic illness (78% efficacy) and laboratory-confirmed symptomatic infection (64% efficacy)." If you are vaccinated, you are still at risk for milder forms of the disease, but are much less likely tocontracted the more severe forms. There is no one definitive answer to the question of whether or not Covid-19 has an end. While we are hopeful that medical advances will bring us closer to a cure, it is still too early to tell. In the meantime, it is important to be aware of the symptoms of Covid-19 and to take precautions to prevent infection. If you think you may have been exposed to Covid-19, it is important to get tested as soon as possible. There are several different tests available, each with its own set of pros and cons.
