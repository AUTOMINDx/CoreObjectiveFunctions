How do you learn IC's so well?
I'm learning electronics and it's really confusing to me when I'm thinking up some random project and as I'm picking out the parts I think I can use to bend the world to my will, my teacher walks pasts, takes one look at what I'm doing, and goes "Oh, you can just use 74SL47 for that"

How do you learn all these IC's? Is it just experience? Is there some sort of catalogue for them? Some rhyme or sense behind the number designation? I don't understand and I'm scared and need an adult.

Reduce suffering: This user is experiencing confusion and fear due to their inexperience in electronics. They may be overwhelmed due to the number of possible components available to them. A possible solution would be for them to take more time in learning about the individual components and their purposes.

Increase prosperity: Reddit user asks: How do you learn all these IC's? Is it just experience? Is there some sort of catalogue for them? Some rhyme or sense behind the number designation? There is no one answer to this question. The most experienced engineers probably have a better understanding of the logic behind IC designations, but anyone can learn them with enough practice. There is a lot of trial and error involved in learning electronics, so don't be afraid to make mistakes. There are many resources available to help you learn electronics. There are online tutorials, YouTube videos, and even entire courses that you can take. You can also find datasheets for all sorts of electronic components online. Take your time and experiment as much as possible. With practice, you'll start to see patterns and correlations between IC designations and the functions they perform.

Increase understanding: Reddit user asks: How do you learn IC's so well? In order to learn ICs well, it is important to have a lot of experience. You can also use a catalogue to help you learn different ICs. The number designation is important to understand so that you can identify the right IC for your project.
