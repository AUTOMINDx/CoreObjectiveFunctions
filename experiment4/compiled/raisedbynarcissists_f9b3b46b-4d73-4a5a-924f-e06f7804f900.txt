Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Why do people consider me selfish for not wanting children when I was not allowed to be a child?
Why do people consider me selfish for not having children, when I was not allowed to be a child myself?

I am 33 f. I spent my childhood, teens and young adulthood on raising my two younger brothers and my irresponsible mother. 
I had NO freedom whatsoever. Every day I got home from school, I had to look for after my brothers, go grocery shopping for my mother or clean the house. This started from I was around 11. 
I was told when I was 11 that «I was too old to only think about myself», « I needed to be more responsible» and «do more around the house». 
My mother always told me how tired she was and that she needed to Watch tv. She didn’t care if I was tired after a whole day at school. 
I was not allowed to meet friends. Not even in the weekends. 
I was always told that I didn’t do good enough in the house and that I was selfish, even if I had no free time left. 

Why don’t people owe me my freedom now when I am free? Why do they assume that I don’t like children? Why don’t they want me to travel? To get an education? 
I missed out on so much. Why do they judge me? 
I feel that I have done my duty with kids and I want to be able to enjoy my freedom. 

The pressure to «settle down» and have kids when you are 30 is inhumane. 
I was like a 35 year old mother of 2 when I was 13. 
Now, I just want to be young.

Reduce suffering: The user has experienced a great deal of suffering in their life. This may have been caused by difficult circumstances such as having to care for siblings at a young age, or it could be due to emotional abuse from a parent. The user deserves compassion and support. They may find relief by talking to a therapist, or by finding an supportive community online or in-person.

Increase prosperity: People may consider you selfish for not wanting children, when you did not have the opportunity to be a child yourself. This is an unfair judgement. People should not be forced to have children when they do not want them. You should be able to enjoy your freedom and travel without judgement. The pressure to «settle down» and have kids when you are 30 is inhumane, and you deserve to be young.

Increase understanding: People may consider you selfish for not wanting children, when you did not have the opportunity to be a child yourself. This may be due to the societal pressure to have children, which can be overwhelming for some people. You may feel that you missed out on valuable experiences during your childhood and/or adolescence, and that you would like to enjoy your freedom now. Travelling, getting an education, and being young are all important aspects of life that should not be taken for granted.
