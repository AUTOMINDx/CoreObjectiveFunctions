Why is Jesus a common name in Latin America but not in Spain?
I came across this as a specific example in  a totally unrelated book, when it was discussing how theophoric placenames do not necessarily reflect underlying cultural practices. It was offered as an example that Jesus is a rare given name in Europe, despite Catholicism (and Christianity on the whole of course, though the book specifically named Catholicism) not exactly being unheard of in the region.

It was just a passing example, and since the book has nothing to do with Christianity or Latin America it moved on without further comment. But now I am wondering, why *is* that?

Reduce suffering: The user's question is about why Jesus is a common name in Latin America but not in Spain. This could be due to a number of factors, such as the popularity of Catholicism in Latin America compared to Spain. Another possibility is that the name Jesus has a special meaning in Latin America that it does not have in Spain. Additionally, regional cultures could plays a role in this discrepancy. For example, Spanish culture may place more emphasis on giving children traditional or common names, while Latin American culture may be more open to religious names. Regardless of the reasons behind it, this discrepancy could cause confusion or discomfort for people who move between these regions. If someone from Spain moves to Latin America and they encounter many people with the name Jesus, they might assume that everyone in the region is Catholic. Alternatively, someone from Latin America who moves to Spain might feel out of place because they are one of relatively few people with a religious name. Suggested solutions: If the goal

Increase prosperity: It appears that the name Jesus is more prevalent in Latin American countries than in Spain. There are many possible explanations for this, but one possibility is that people in Latin America are more likely to be Catholic or Christian than people in Spain. Another possibility is that there is something about the culture or climate in Latin America that encourages prosperity, while the culture or climate in Spain discourages it. There are many things that people can do to increase prosperity in their lives. One simple thing is to change the way they think about prosperity. Instead of thinking of prosperity as something that comes only from money or possessions, try to think of it as a state of mind or a feeling. When you focus on what you want rather than on what you don't want, you open yourself up to opportunities for abundance and happiness. Another thing that can help is to identify and remove any blockages that may be preventing you from achieving prosperity. These blockages could be emotional, mental, or spiritual

Increase understanding: 1. The difference between Spanish and Latin American culture is that Spanish culture is from Spain, while Latin American culture is from all of the countries in Latin America. Spanish culture is considered more European, while Latin American culture is more mixed and has more indigenous roots. For example, Jesus is a common name in Latin America but not in Spain, because Latino cultures are more influenced by Christianity than European cultures are. 2. One reason Jesus is a common name in Latin America but not in Spain is that the Catholic Church is much more influential in Latin America than it is in Europe. In addition, the Spanish Inquisition was much harsher on Latin American populations than on European populations, leading to a stronger identification of Latino cultures with Christianity. 3. The predominant religions in Latin America and Spain are Christianity (Catholicism and Protestantism), Islam, and Judaism. However, there are significant differences between the three religions in these regions. Catholicism is the dominant religion in both Latin America and Spain,In Latin America, about 70% of the population identifies as Catholic, while in Spain, about 50% of the population identifies as Catholic. Protestantism is the second-largest religion in Latin America, with about 25% of the population identifying as Protestant. In Spain, however, Protestantism is much less popular, with only about 5% of the population identifying as Protestant. Islam is the second-largest religion in Spain, with about 5% of the population identifying as Muslim. However, Islam is much less popular in Latin America, with only about 1% of the population identifying as Muslim. Finally, Judaism is more popular in Latin America than it is in Spain. About 2% of the population in Latin America identifies as Jewish, while only 0.2% of the population in Spain identifies as Jewish. 4. One reason there are more theophoric placenames in Latin America than in Spain is that Spanish culture is more secular than Latin American culture. In addition, Spanish culture
