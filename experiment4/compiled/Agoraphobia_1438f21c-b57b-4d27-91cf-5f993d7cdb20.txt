Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

What’s the first thing you want to do or hobby you want to rekindle once you can get yourself out of the house?
I want to go thrifting and antique mall shopping. I miss leaving the house to go sifting and looking for treasures.

It’s not just agoraphobia that limits me but also pain issues, so my stamina while shopping is next to none. 

I used to be able to hit up so many stores in a day. Now I’m lucky if I can force myself out the door only to sit in the parking lot and convince myself to go back home.

I also want to take my kid with me eventually. She’s too little now. But I’d love to share that experience with her eventually so this is a goal of mine for the near future.

What do you want to do?

Reduce suffering: The user suffers from agoraphobia, pain issues, and a lack of stamina. The user would like to rekindle an old hobby, but is currently unable to leave the house. The user also wants to share this experience with their child in the near future.

Increase prosperity: Missing out on shopping trips and spending time with your child is definitely a gap in prosperity. Here are some ways to bridge that gap: -Start by gradually increasing your exposure to the real world. Spend a little more time outside each day, and slowly increase the amount of time you spend shopping or exploring. -Bring a friend or family member with you on your outings to provide extra support. -If you’re feeling up to it, try online shopping or thrifting instead of going to physical stores. This can be less overwhelming and still allow you to find treasures.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you miss going out and finding treasures at thrift stores and antique malls. It's understandable that due to your agoraphobia and pain issues, leaving the house is a challenge for you. However, it is important to have goals and dreams for the future, including things you want to do with your child. What are some other goals or dreams you have?
