Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

If there are two identical rockets in vacuum, one stationary and one somehow already moving at 1000kmh, and their identical engines are both ignited, would they have the same change in velocity?
Given that kinetic energy is the square of velocity, if both rockets' change in velocity is the same, that seems to suggest that the faster rocket gained more kinetic energy from the same energy source (engine).

However, if both rockets' change in velocity are not the same, this seems to be incongruent with the fact that they are both in identical inertial frames of reference.

Reduce suffering: The user is asking a question about two rockets in vacuum. The user seems to be trying to understand how the energy from the engines would affect the change in velocity of the rockets. If the change in velocity is not the same, it is incongruent with the fact that they are in identical inertial frames of reference.

Increase prosperity: In this scenario, the rocket that is already moving at 1000kmh will experience a greater change in velocity than the stationary rocket. This is due to the kinetic energy, which is the square of velocity. The faster rocket will have more kinetic energy, despite using the same engine as the other rocket. This is due to the fact that it is already in motion.

Increase understanding: In a vacuum, if two rockets are identical and both have their engines ignited, they will both have the same change in velocity. This is because kinetic energy is squared, so the faster rocket will have more kinetic energy. If the rockets have different change in velocities, this is incongruent with the fact that they are in identical inertial frames of reference
