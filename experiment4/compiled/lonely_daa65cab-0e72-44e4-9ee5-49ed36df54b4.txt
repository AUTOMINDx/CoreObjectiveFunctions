i got a bf but
im still not part of society. I don’t really have much history in this world. I basically laid depressed in my room for years, no life. no human connections whatsoever… it’s hard to make friends when you don’t have a history. 

i talk with my boyfriend and he reminds me of this. I didn’t go to any friends’ parties when i was younger, never had sex before him or any relationships, never experienced the normal young adult/college stuff, forget about the teen experience…. 

don’t have a loving family. the friends ive tried to make along the way turned out to see me as fifth wheel or just plain didn’t like me, talked bad about me.


i feel completely alien to this world. 
and I just want to not exist. i feel an ache in my chest that sometimes is apparent and i know it is my mind making it physically known that i am not well, i am not happy. i am tired and sleep doesn’t bring me energy.

Reduce suffering: This user is experiencing a great deal of suffering. This may be due to a lack of social interaction, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. The user may also feel like they don't belong in the world, leading to a sense of alienation. These feelings can be very distressing and may cause significant psychological distress. Possible solutions include seeking counseling or therapy, or joining social groups or clubs that focus on activities the user enjoys.

Increase prosperity: It is difficult to make friends and connections when you don’t have a history. It is important to find activities that you enjoy, and to find people that share those same interests. Joining clubs or groups related to your hobbies or favorite activities is a great way to meet new people. You can also look online for forums or social media groups that are related to your interests. If you don’t feel like you fit in with traditional friends, there are plenty of other people out there who share your interests. Don’t be afraid to reach out and connect with them. Additionally, it is important to build relationships with family and close friends. These are the people that will be there for you when you need them most. Talk to them about your concerns and feelings, and let them know what you need from them. Feeling connected to others is an important part of increasing prosperity.

Increase understanding: It can be difficult to make friends when you don't have a history, and it can be especially difficult to make friends if you don't have a loving family. It's possible that the friends you've tried to make turned out to see you as a fifth wheel or that they just plain didn't like you. If you feel completely alien to this world, and if you have an ache in your chest that is apparent, it is possible that you are not well.
