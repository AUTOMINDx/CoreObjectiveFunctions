Reduce suffering: The user is experiencing pain and suffering due to the attitudes of their friends. The friends are sending TikToks about the user's chronic illness, which is making the user feel uncomfortable. The users seems to be hurt by the jokes that their friends make about their illness. They have confronted one of their friends about it, and the friend has shrugged it off. The user does not know what to do. The root cause of this suffering is likely the attitudes of the friends. Their joking around likely comes from a place of ignorance rather than malice. However, this ignorance still causes harm to the user. The recommended solution in this situation would be education. The friends need to be taught about how their jokes are harmful and why they should avoid making them.

Increase prosperity: If this situation is troubling to you, there are actions you can take to increase your prosperity. First, talk to your friends about why this content makes you uncomfortable. Let them know that it hurts your feelings when they share disability-related TikToks with you. If they are open to dialogue, they may be more mindful of what they share in the future. Additionally, you could unfollow any accounts that regularly post content that makes you feel bad. This will help you focus on content that makes you feel happy and prosperous. Finally, remember that your friends likely don’t mean to hurt your feelings - they may just not be aware of how their content affects you. Try to be understanding and forgiving, and continue to work on building a community of support around you.

Increase understanding: If you're uncomfortable with friends sending you TikToks about your chronic illness, there are a few things you can do. You can talk to your friends about why the videos make you uncomfortable and see if they can stop sending them. You can also unfollow or block the friends who are sending you TikToks that make you feel uncomfortable. If you find that the jokes and humor your friends are sending are mocking your chronic illness, it's important to talk to them about why this is hurtful and offensive. You may need to set some boundaries with these friends and explain that you're not comfortable with jokes that mock your health condition. If they continue to send these kinds of videos, it may be best to distance yourself from these friends.One example of an instance where someone might feel uncomfortable with friends sending them TikToks about their chronic illness is when those videos are making fun of the person's health condition. For example, if a friend sends you a video that laughs at your inability to walk or breathe, this might be too much for some people to handle. In cases like this, it's important to talk to your friends about why the videos make you uncomfortable. If they don't stop sending the videos after you talk to them, you might need to unfollow or block them.
