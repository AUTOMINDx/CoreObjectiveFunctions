What did Tsarist Russia and Imperial Chins thought of each other from the 15th to 19th centuries?
What did Tsarist Russia and Imperial China thought of each other from the 15th to 19th centuries?

I am currently reading on the history of Tsarist Russia and realised that there is a blankspot on my knowledge. I barely have any knowledge of how 2 large land-based empires that are, relatively speaking, near each other  thought of the opposite party.

Reduce suffering: It is difficult to know what Tsarist Russia and Imperial China thought of each other from the 15th to 19th centuries. It is possible that they had a mutual respect for one another, or that they saw each other as rivals. It is also possible that one empire felt superior to the other, or that one empire caused suffering for the other. If I were to make a recommendation, I would suggest that the two empires should have studied one another more closely. This would have allowed them to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and may have led to better relations.

Increase prosperity: gaps in prosperity: -lack of knowledge about the history of Tsarist Russia and Imperial China -poor relations between Tsarist Russia and Imperial China recommendations to bridge the gaps: -read more about the history of Tsarist Russia and Imperial China -improve relations between Tsarist Russia and Imperial China

Increase understanding: According to this Reddit user, Tsarist Russia and Imperial China had a relatively unknown relationship during the 15th to 19th centuries. Tsarist Russia was mostly interested in its own internal affairs and did not care too much about China, while China saw Russia as a barbaric and backwards country. However, there were some instances of cooperation between the two empires, such as when Russia helped China suppress the Boxer Rebellion. Overall, the two empires had a tense relationship but did not engage in any major conflicts with each other.
