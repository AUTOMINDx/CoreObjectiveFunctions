Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

What did Tsarist Russia and Imperial Chins thought of each other from the 15th to 19th centuries?
What did Tsarist Russia and Imperial China thought of each other from the 15th to 19th centuries?

I am currently reading on the history of Tsarist Russia and realised that there is a blankspot on my knowledge. I barely have any knowledge of how 2 large land-based empires that are, relatively speaking, near each other  thought of the opposite party.

Reduce suffering: It is difficult to know what Tsarist Russia and Imperial China thought of each other from the 15th to 19th centuries. It is possible that they had a mutual respect for one another, or that they saw each other as rivals. It is also possible that one empire felt superior to the other, or that one empire caused suffering for the other. If I were to make a recommendation, I would suggest that the two empires should have studied one another more closely. This would have allowed them to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and may have led to better relations.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity, depending on the definition of prosperity used. For wealth, one way to increase revenue is to increase trade with other countries. For happiness, one way to increase satisfaction is to provide social services such as healthcare and education. For health, one way to improve well-being is by increasing access to clean water and sanitation. For abundance, one way to encourage growth is by improving infrastructure such as roads and bridges. And for thriving, one way to support progress is by increasing access to technology.

Increase understanding: 1) Tsarist Russia had a complicated relationship with Imperial China. They generally thought of China as a backward, uncivilized country. However, they also saw China as a potential ally against the British and other European powers. 2) Imperial China had a much more positive view of Tsarist Russia. They saw Russia as a strong, powerful nation that could help them protect their sovereignty and independence. 3) The relations between Tsarist Russia and Imperial China were generally peaceful during the 15th to 19th centuries. There were some skirmishes and tensions over territory, but overall the two countries got along well. 4) Tsarist Russia and Imperial China viewed each other with a mixture of respect and suspicion. Both countries were wary of each other's intentions, and were constantly sizing each other up. 5) The main cause of tension between Tsarist Russia and Imperial China was the question of who would control Manchuria and Mongolia. These were both strategically importantThe two countries fought several wars over control of these regions.
