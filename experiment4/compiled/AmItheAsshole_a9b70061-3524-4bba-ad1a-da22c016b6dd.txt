AITA for being "ungrateful" of the cake my boyfriend made me?
I(33f) have been dating a man, “Alex”(34m) for almost 3 years. Alex has a 13 year old daughter from a previous marriage that he has full custody of. 

When we met Alex was doing very well, he made 6 figures and he had a decent house in a fine neighborhood. I had a slightly lower paying job.  Almost a year and a half ago, his job had to cut some employees and he was one of them. He had to take on a job and he earned much less than he had before. 

I moved into their house 5 months ago. Since I moved in I have helped a lot with the bills, usually half or more of them. 

Yesterday was my birthday. I wanted to celebrate at a nice restaurant near us, however it was closed. There was another one a little closer to us, although it was more expensive. I suggested going there for my birthday to Alex, and he said that he couldn't afford to pay for dinner there and if we went we would need to split the bill. I was a little upset but he said he would make something himself. 

The cake I wanted was, admittedly, somewhat expensive. I pointed it out to him, and he said again that he didn't think he could afford it with Christmas coming up and we'd have to go half. I told him I wasn't paying for a cake for my own birthday, and he said he'd see what he could do. 

Well, yesterday came. He made dinner, and it was quite good, better than most meals we eat, although not as good as what it would be at a restaurant. However, when he brought the cake out it was just something he had made himself. 

He said he was sorry he couldn't afford the nicer cake but he had made this one and his daughter had helped. 

I pretended to enjoy it but after I told him that I was hoping for a slightly nicer cake. He said he had tried his best and he couldn't spend the money he had set aside for bills on a cake. 

I guess his daughter heard because now he's also saying that I made her upset after she helped make it. 

He keeps saying I should apologize to her and say that I really liked it. 

AITA?

Reduce suffering: The user appears to be experiencing significant financial hardship. The cause may be job loss, as the user's partner has lost his job. The user has moved in with the partner and his daughter, and is evidently helping to pay bills. The user seems to resent this, as indicated by their comment that they "wanted to celebrate at a nice restaurant near us, however it was closed." They are also bitter about the quality of the cake their partner made, which he apologizes for. It is possible that the user's resentment stems from a feeling of being taken for granted. They may feel that their contributions are not appreciated. It might be helpful for the user to express their feelings to their partner directly. This could lead to a discussion about the financial situation and potential solutions.

Increase prosperity: It seems like you feel unappreciated by your boyfriend, who is also the father of your stepdaughter. You have been dating for nearly three years and have lived together for the past five months. During that time, you have contributed significantly to the family finances. You suggest going out to eat on your birthday, but when it comes time to pay, your boyfriend says he can't afford it. He makes a cake instead. You should be open and honest with your boyfriend about your feelings. Let him know that you feel taken for granted and that his recent job loss has made things difficult for both of you. Suggest ways that he can make up for this, such as cooking a nicer dinner more often or taking you out for a special occasion. If he is unwilling or unable to do these things, then you may need to reconsider the nature of your relationship.

Increase understanding: From what is said in this post, it seems that the OP's partner has had a decrease in income in the past year and a half. The OP moved into their house five months ago and has been helping with the bills since then. The OP also says that they wanted to celebrate their birthday at a restaurant, but when they found out the restaurant was closed, they suggested going to another, more expensive restaurant. The partner said that he couldn't afford to pay for dinner there and that if they went, they would need to split the bill. The OP was upset by this but decided to go along with it. Yesterday, the partner made dinner- it was good but not as good as going out to eat. They also brought a cake out- which was just something he had made himself. The OP says that they pretended to enjoy the cake but that after eating it, they told their partner that they were hoping for a nicer cake. Their partner told them that they should apologize to
