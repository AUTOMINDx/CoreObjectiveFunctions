Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Nephew hitting my son
My husband’s brother’s son is 2.5 years old and my son is 3, about a 7 month difference. My nephew, let’s call him J is constantly hitting my son, pinching him, throwing toys at him and stealing toys away. All my sister in law does is say “no” in the nicest way possible or “let’s not do that”. Immediately after, he does the same thing again. No times outs, no actual consequences, nothing. We see them pretty frequently because we live close by and our family gets together pretty often. My mother in law doesn’t see this as a problem and says “he’s just frustrated”. My mother in law frequently takes sides with her kids but that’s another story. Anyways, I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to be the one disciplining someone’s kid but I am not okay with my son constantly being bullied. Also, just want to say that I’m not blaming my nephew at all. But I don’t think it’s okay that he continues doing this and his parents keep allowing this behavior. What should I do?

Reduce suffering: The user experiences suffering due to their nephew's aggressive behavior toward their son. The nephew may be frustrated and acting out, but his parents do not seem to be stopping the behavior or providing any real consequences. The user may feel helpless in this situation and unsure of what to do. They may want to stand up to their brother and sister-in-law about the issue, but that could create tension within the family. They could also try talking to their mother-in-law about how they feel and see if she can help get the parents to discipline their child.

Increase prosperity: If you are feeling uncomfortable with the way your nephew is treating your son, it is important to step in and do something about it. Your mother-in-law may not see this as a problem, but it is important that you set boundaries for your son's sake. You could start by having a discussion with your brother-in-law about how you would like him to handle his son's behavior. If necessary, you could also take J aside and talk to him about how he should treat others. It is important that he knows that this type of behavior is not acceptable. By establishing boundaries and teaching your nephew how to behave properly, you will help increase prosperity for both your family and his.

Increase understanding: If your son is being bullied by his nephew, there are a few things that you can do to help him feel safe and get the situation under control. First, it's important to talk to your son about what's going on and help him understand that the bullying is not his fault. Next, make sure that your son knows that he can come to you for help anytime he needs it. You may also want to consider talking to the parents of your nephew and let them know what's going on. This can help them address the issue with their child and hopefully get him to stop bullying your son. If the bullying continues, you may want to consider seeking professional help.What do you want to know specifically?
