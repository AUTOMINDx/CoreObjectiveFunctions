Contributions to science outside of traditional papers in journals?
I read once that Dawkins was an example of contributions to science that came from a scientist just skipping journals and publishing themselves. Is this an accurate characterization? If so, what are other examples of contributions to scientific consensus that came from sources other than peer-reviewed papers published in scientific journals? If this entire concept isn't really applicable, then let me know about that instead! Thank you!

Reduce suffering: It is difficult to provide an accurate characterization of the suffering present in this Reddit post, as it is not clear what specific difficulties the user is experiencing. However, it seems that the user may be feeling uncertain or unsupported in their scientific pursuits, as they ask for examples of successful contributions to science that did not come from traditional peer-reviewed papers. It is possible that the user is experiencing feelings of insecurity or doubt in their abilities, and that seeking validation from others may help to alleviate these feelings. Additionally, the user could explore resources such as online forums or support groups specifically for scientists, in order to get more feedback and encouragement in their work.

Increase prosperity: According to an article by Richard Dawkins, skipping the process of publishing in scientific journals and going directly to the public can be an effective way to share contributions to science. This was done by Dawkins himself when he wrote his book, The Selfish Gene. He also cites Nikola Tesla as an example of a scientist who did not rely on the traditional publishing process, instead publishing his work in popular magazines. There are many other examples of scientists who have shared their contributions to scientific consensus in various ways outside of the traditional peer-reviewed process.

Increase understanding: There are many ways to contribute to scientific consensus besides publishing papers in scientific journals. One example is when scientists like Richard Dawkins write books that explain their research in a way that is accessible to the general public. This can help spread knowledge about new discoveries and help people better understand complex topics.
