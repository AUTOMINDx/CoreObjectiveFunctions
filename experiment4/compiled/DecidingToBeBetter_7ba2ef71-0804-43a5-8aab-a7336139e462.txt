Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

I stopped myself from self harming today.
No one was at home. I felt like punching the metal locker till the skin on my knuckles came off. I even took off the ring that they gave me for good luck so that it wouldn't be damaged. They had asked me not to take it off, ever. Well I did, to punch the locker. Wearing it had left an imprint on my finger. But then my cat saw me hovering intentionally in the corner. She walked up to me and meowed. I was unable to get out of bed till then and she wanted affection. So I gave it to her. Put the ring back on. I thought, my friend would be really worried if he noticed my knuckles had gotten even more damaged the next time we met. I told myself, how does self harming help in any way? Instead, do something that helps you, like taking the anti depressant on time. Go. So I spent some more time with the cat until the others came home and there was no risk of me trying something stupid. This is a win to me. Maybe I'll call up my friend in a bit and ask him to talk about something random for 5 minutes as a distraction. I can't share this to anyone, I could to him, but he'd worry. He's been asking me to write down my troubles as a coping mechanism, since I like writing. So here we are, reddit stranger. Here's my short story of deciding to be better.

Edit: I brushed way earlier than I usually do. Today is definitely a win.

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user is suffering from depression and may be self harming. The user's cat is a source of comfort and helps the user resist harming themselves. The user may benefit from therapy and/or medication.

Increase prosperity: This post shows how a small victory can lead to a larger victory. The user was about to harm themselves, but their cat intervened and gave them the affection they needed. The user then decided to do something that would help themselves, like taking their medication on time. This led to them spending more time with their cat and Brushing their teeth earlier than usual. These are all small wins that add up to increased prosperity. There are still gaps in this individual's prosperity, such as the lack of social support. The user could reach out to friends or family members for support when they feel struggling.

Increase understanding: The Reddit user describes an incident where they stopped themselves from self harming, but felt like punching a metal locker. They explain that they took off their ring for good luck, but then their cat saw them and walked up to them. The user explains that they were unable to get out of bed until the cat wanted affection, so they gave it to her. They then say that they thought about how self harming doesn't help and instead do something that helps like taking the anti depressant on time. They go on to say that they called up their friend and talked to him for 5 minutes. The user ends their post by saying that it was a win to them.
