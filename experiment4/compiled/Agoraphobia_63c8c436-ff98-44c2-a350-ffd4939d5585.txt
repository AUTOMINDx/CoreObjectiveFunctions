Was gonna bail but I pushed myself to go to my relatives house. Nervous rnâ€¦
There right now and feeling quite nervous but tryna relax. Have the dry mouth symptom and shakes but telling myself it will be okay as it always does when I settle in on an exposure.

Edit: went well and we didnâ€™t have to stay too long anyway. So tired now though. Felt some type of weird guilt when catching up on life because I had to pretend like Iâ€™m not an agoraphobic whoâ€™s done nothing social this year ðŸ˜«. Iâ€™m like kind of embarrassed for myself in that aspect.

Edit 2: today I went to another house for a different family gathering. Did not have much anxiety at all! I even fell asleep for a little bit there.

Reduce suffering: This person is likely suffering from social anxiety disorder. They may feel guilty and embarrassed because they are unable to participate in normal social activities like other people their age. Some potential solutions for this person include cognitive-behavioral therapy or medication.

Increase prosperity: It sounds like you have made progress in your journey to overcoming your agoraphobia. Bravo! It is important to take small steps and celebrate each victory. Remember, Rome was not built in a day. There will be set backs, but donâ€™t let them discourage you. Be proud of yourself for pushing yourself and for facing your fears. There are still some gaps in your prosperity that need to be addressed. First, it is important to build up your self-confidence. This will help you to face future challenges with more courage. Second, it is important to find social activities that you enjoy and that fit your lifestyle. This will make it easier for you to engage in social activities without feeling anxious or nervous. Finally, it is important to have a support system, whether that is friends, family, or a therapist. These people can offer encouragement and practical advice when needed.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you are feeling anxious about going to your relatives' house. It is common to feel nervous when starting an exposure. It is important to remember that it will be okay and that the anxiety will likely decrease as you settle in. It sounds like you had a positive experience at the first gathering, and even fell asleep. This is a good sign! It may take some time to adjust to socializing again, but don't be discouraged. Try to focus on your progress so far. You went to another family gathering today and felt less anxious. This is also a good sign! Be proud of yourself for pushing yourself and continuing to socialize. Remember that Rome wasn't built in a day, and you are making progress every time you face your fears.
