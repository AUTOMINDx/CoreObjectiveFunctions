Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Men, what’s something you feel that men experience that you feel like society dismisses or downplays?
For me, it’s body issues. I’ve always felt anxious being out in public because there’s a part of me that feels like everyone is looking at me and judging me. I’ll take my dog for his walk and get anxious whenever someone in a car drives by because I feel like they’re looking at me and judging me for my weight and over all appearance. 

I remember about a month ago Jonah Hill made a post on instagram asking everyone to basically back off on the comments on his body, and on Twitter there were a bunch of women making it all about them and their body issues and how it hurts women more and one woman actually referred to Jonah’s situation as an ‘anomaly’. My blood was just about boiling. Yes it’s true that body issues/shaming has historically hurt women more than men but this is hardly an ‘anomaly’…

Reduce suffering: The user experiences anxiety around their body and appearance. They feel that society dismisses or downplays the issue. The root cause may be insecurity or self-consciousness. A possible solution may be therapy or counseling to help the user address their underlying issues.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity. Some suggestions include: 1. Exercise and eat a healthy diet. This will help you feel good about your body and increase your sense of self-confidence. 2. Spend time with positive people who make you feel good about yourself. 3. Set realistic goals and work towards them. This will give you a sense of accomplishment and increase your feelings of self-worth. 4. Take care of yourself both physically and emotionally. This will help you feel happy and fulfilled.

Increase understanding: There is a growing concern around the body image of men. Men are often shamed for their bodies, and feel a great deal of anxiety around their appearance. This can have a significant impact on their mental health and overall wellbeing. Some of the key factors that contribute to this body image anxiety in men include the widespread use of Photoshop in advertising, the focus on muscularity in the media, and the lack of male role models who are comfortable with their own bodies. These cultural messages send the message that men must be thin and muscular to be attractive, and this can lead to a lot of self-doubt and insecurity. Many men also feel pressure to be strong and fearless, which can create additional stress around body image. This can manifest itself in eating disorders, steroid use, and other unhealthy behaviours. It is important for men to have positive body image role models to look up to. It is also crucial for society as a whole to send more positive messagesOne example of a negative message that men often receive about their bodies is the focus on muscularity in the media. There is a pervasive narrative that men must have rippling muscles in order to be considered attractive or successful. This can be very damaging for men who don't have the naturally muscular build, as it can lead to feelings of insecurity and self-doubt. Additionally, the use of Photoshop in advertising can be extremely harmful for male body image. Many ads feature impossibly perfect models who have been airbrushed to perfection. This can create an unrealistic standard for men to strive for, which often leads to disappointment and dissatisfaction with their own bodies.
