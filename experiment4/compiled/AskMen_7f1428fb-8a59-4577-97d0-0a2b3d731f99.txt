Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Men, what’s something you feel that men experience that you feel like society dismisses or downplays?
For me, it’s body issues. I’ve always felt anxious being out in public because there’s a part of me that feels like everyone is looking at me and judging me. I’ll take my dog for his walk and get anxious whenever someone in a car drives by because I feel like they’re looking at me and judging me for my weight and over all appearance. 

I remember about a month ago Jonah Hill made a post on instagram asking everyone to basically back off on the comments on his body, and on Twitter there were a bunch of women making it all about them and their body issues and how it hurts women more and one woman actually referred to Jonah’s situation as an ‘anomaly’. My blood was just about boiling. Yes it’s true that body issues/shaming has historically hurt women more than men but this is hardly an ‘anomaly’…

Reduce suffering: The user experiences anxiety around their body and appearance. They feel that society dismisses or downplays the issue. The root cause may be insecurity or self-consciousness. A possible solution may be therapy or counseling to help the user address their underlying issues.

Increase prosperity: The Reddit user's experience of anxiety around body image is a common one. Many people feel judged and anxious about their appearance. This can be a particular issue for men, who may feel that they are not supposed to have body image issues. One way to increase prosperity is to create an environment where people feel safe to express themselves without judgement. This could involve challenging the way society dismisses or downplays the experience of men with body image issues. It could also mean creating more forums for open discussion about these issues, so that people can share their experiences and learn from each other.

Increase understanding: I remember reading an article a while back about how, even though body image issues have always been a problem for women, it's recently become an issue for men as well. I think it's important to have a discussion about this, because it seems like society is still dismissing or downplaying the experiences of men who struggle with these issues. It's true that body image issues have always been a problem for women, but I think it's important to remember that this is also an issue for men. I find it frustrating that society is still dismissing or downplaying the experiences of men who struggle with these issues.
