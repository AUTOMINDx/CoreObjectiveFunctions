Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

AITA for telling my daughter to get over herself?
I was blessed with three beautiful children and unfortunately, my eldest, Brooke, passed away when she was 5 years old. It rocked my world and I know I haven’t been the same since. I went through therapy and still attend to this day, but a part of me died too.

I will never let my daughter be forgotten. I bring pictures of her to events such as holiday celebrations and birthdays. I talk about her all the time. Every year on my living children’s birthdays, I think of her and how her once younger siblings are now older than her. 

My daughter, Marnie, is getting married next month. I asked her if she was having a memorial table and she said no. I asked her about creating a seat for her sister who passed, as she should be a part of the day. Marnie told me no, for once she wants a day about her. She says she couldn’t have one event that wasn’t about Brooke. Even her graduation, I had put a picture of her on the seat. She said I needed to stop making my grief “front stage”.

I told her she was being incredibly selfish and until she goes through a loss like this, she’ll never understand. Marnie asked me if her kids would have to live under the shadow of Brooke too. I told her she should be ashamed and to get over herself.

My son says I’m being terrible and I need to re-evaluate my life. AITA?

Reduce suffering: This person is grieving the loss of their daughter and feels that their other children are living in her shadow. They are angry with their daughter for not wanting a memorial table at her wedding, and with themselves for feeling this way. They may benefit from therapy, and should try to remember that their other children are not Brooke and should not have to live in her shadow.

Increase prosperity: It sounds like you are grieving the loss of your daughter, which is completely understandable. However, it is important that you try to find ways to celebrate her life and keep her memory alive. Your son is right - you need to re-evaluate your life. You should focus on finding ways to enjoy life and find happiness again. This may be difficult, but it is certainly possible. There are many things that can help people through the grieving process, such as therapy or support groups. You should also consider writing about your experiences or painting/drawing about them. These are all excellent ways to work through your grief and keep Brooke's memory alive.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you are very grieving for your daughter who passed away. It is understandable that you want to keep her memory alive and talk about her all the time. It is also understandable that your daughter would want a day that is about her and not her sister who passed away. Memorial tables or seats are a way to do both. You can talk about your daughter who passed away and have a place for her at the event. Your daughter is right that she should be able to have a day that is only about her. It is possible to have both things happen at the same time.
