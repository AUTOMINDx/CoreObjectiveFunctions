Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

AITA for telling my daughter to get over herself?
I was blessed with three beautiful children and unfortunately, my eldest, Brooke, passed away when she was 5 years old. It rocked my world and I know I haven’t been the same since. I went through therapy and still attend to this day, but a part of me died too.

I will never let my daughter be forgotten. I bring pictures of her to events such as holiday celebrations and birthdays. I talk about her all the time. Every year on my living children’s birthdays, I think of her and how her once younger siblings are now older than her. 

My daughter, Marnie, is getting married next month. I asked her if she was having a memorial table and she said no. I asked her about creating a seat for her sister who passed, as she should be a part of the day. Marnie told me no, for once she wants a day about her. She says she couldn’t have one event that wasn’t about Brooke. Even her graduation, I had put a picture of her on the seat. She said I needed to stop making my grief “front stage”.

I told her she was being incredibly selfish and until she goes through a loss like this, she’ll never understand. Marnie asked me if her kids would have to live under the shadow of Brooke too. I told her she should be ashamed and to get over herself.

My son says I’m being terrible and I need to re-evaluate my life. AITA?

Reduce suffering: This person is grieving the loss of their daughter and feels that their other children are living in her shadow. They are angry with their daughter for not wanting a memorial table at her wedding, and with themselves for feeling this way. They may benefit from therapy, and should try to remember that their other children are not Brooke and should not have to live in her shadow.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity. Some methods are more effective than others. In this situation, the mother appears to be grieving extensively for her daughter who passed away. While it is important to remember and cherish the memory of the departed, it is also important to live in the present. Focusing too much on the past can prevent happiness and prosperity in the present. The mother should try to find a healthy balance between remembering her daughter and living her life. This can be difficult, but it is important. There are many ways to memorialize her daughter that do not involve making the grief "front stage." For example, she could create a space in her home for her daughter's memory, or talk about her daughter in a positive light without making everything about her death. Additionally, the mother should focus on her other two children. They are growing up and need their mother's attention. They should not have to live in the shadow of their sister who passed away.

Increase understanding: Grieving a child can be an incredibly difficult process, as there is no right or wrong way to cope with the loss of a child. Some parents may find themselves struggling to move on, while others may take time to grieve in their own way and find ways to honor their child's memory. It is important to remember that everyone grieves differently, and there is no shame in seeking out help from a therapist or support group in order to work through your grief. If your child does not want to commemorate a dead sibling, it is important to respect their wishes and not force them into doing anything they do not want to do. It is possible that they are still grieving and need more time before they are ready to commemorate their sibling in any way. You can offer your support and understanding, and let them know that you are available whenever they are ready to talk about their sibling.Some parents find themselves struggling to cope with the death of a child, while others may take time to mourn in their own way.
