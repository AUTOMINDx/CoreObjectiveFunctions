Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

If magnetic monopoles exist, what metrics describe a magnetically charged black hole?
Specifically, four different metrics should exist:

Mass ≠ 0, Magnetic charge ≠ 0, Electric charge = 0, angular momentum = 0

Mass ≠ 0, Magnetic charge ≠ 0, Electric charge ≠ 0, angular momentum = 0

Mass ≠ 0, Magnetic charge ≠ 0, Electric charge = 0, angular momentum ≠ 0

Mass ≠ 0, Magnetic charge ≠ 0, Electric charge ≠ 0, angular momentum ≠ 0

As magnetic fields contribute to the T^(00) of the stress-energy tensor, magnetic charge would necessitate a new metric beyond Schwarzschild, Kerr, Reissner-Nordström, and Kerr-Newman.

I do, of course, understand if only the case where all are non-zero has a name, as that's the most general case that the others could be derived from.

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user is asking about a potential solution to a problem. The user seems to be knowledgeable about the topic but may not have the answer to the question. The artificial intelligence would recommend further research on the matter.

Increase prosperity: There are many ways to increase prosperity, but some methods are more effective than others. One way to increase prosperity is to invest in new technology and innovation. By investing in new technologies, businesses can create new products and services that will improve the quality of life for consumers. Additionally, businesses can also invest in research and development to improve the efficiency of their operations. Another way to increase prosperity is by promoting free trade. By participating in free trade, businesses can export their products to new markets around the world. This will help to expand the business and create new jobs. Additionally, free trade will help to reduce prices for consumers, which will improve the standard of living for everyone. Finally, businesses can also promote economic growth by creating a stable environment for investment. By ensuring that the rules and regulations are clear and predictable, businesses will be more likely to invest in new facilities and hire new workers. This will help to stimulate the economy and create jobs.

Increase understanding: Magnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles that carry a single magnetic pole. They are predicted by the mathematical theories of quantum electrodynamics and gauge theory, but have never been observed. If they exist, magnetic monopoles could explain the origins of magnetism. Magnetism is a natural phenomenon that occurs when certain materials are placed in a magnetic field. The materials become magnetized and create their own magnetic field. This force can be used to power motors, generators, and other devices. There are several different types of magnetic fields. The most common is the Lorentz force, which is created by electric currents. Another type is the magnetic dipole field, which is created by magnets. A third type, called a tensor field, is created by special particles called quanta. Black holes are objects in space that have a gravitational force so strong that nothing can escape them, not even light. They are formed when a star runs out of fuel andcollapses. The force of the collapse causes the star to shrink until it becomes a tiny point called a singularity. The gravitational force at the singularity is so strong that it crushes all of the matter in the star into a single point. This point is called the event horizon. Anything that falls beyond the event horizon is pulled into the black hole and can never escape. Black holes come in two varieties, stellar and supermassive. Stellar black holes are created when a star collapses. Supermassive blackholes are located in the center of most galaxies and are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun. Tensor fields are mathematical objects that describe the forces between particles. They are important in theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity. The most famous tensor field is the gravitational field, which describes the force between masses. Schwarzschild solved Einstein's equations for general relativity and found a solution that described a non-rotating sphere of gravitational force. This solution is called the Schwarzschild
