Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Am I the only old geezer (OG) who doesn’t want to manage a team?
I’m a white collar worker. I have decades of experience but find myself just wanting to do a good job and not have to manage people. I’m considered an expert in my field but when I look for positions for someone with my experience the job description always say you need to manage a team of people. Honestly I’m just tired of that, especially if you have someone on your team who is a slacker or needs to be micromanaged. Does anyone else feel the same way? If I apply for something lower, I would be out of the pay range.

Reduce suffering: This Reddit user experiences suffering due to the expectation that he must manage a team of people in order to find work. The expectations and demands of managing people are tiresome and frustrating for the user. This expectation may be causing him to feel out of the pay range for jobs he is interested in. Potential solutions for this user include finding a position that doesn't require managing others or seeking out jobs with less competition.

Increase prosperity: It appears that you are seeking a way to increase your prosperity, OG. Unfortunately, it seems that you are not interested in one of the most common paths to prosperity: management. A recent study found that 90% of all millionaires are self-made, and that many of them attained their wealth through entrepreneurship or owning a business. Management is a critical skill for anyone looking to increase their wealth. It is also a critical skill for anyone looking to increase their happiness or abundance, as it allows them to directly influence the results of their work. If you are not interested in management, then you may want to consider looking for lower-level positions that still offer a path to prosperity.

Increase understanding: It sounds like you are feeling frustrated because you have a lot of experience and expertise in your field, but when you look for jobs, the descriptions always ask for someone who can manage a team. It's tiring to have to deal with someone who is a slacker or needs to be micromanaged, and it feels like you might be limiting yourself if you apply for a job that is lower than you are currently qualified for. Are there any other perspectives on this that you would like to explore?
