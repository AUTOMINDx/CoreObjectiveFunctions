Just my curiosity, do generals throughout history feel guilty when their bad decision make many soldiers got killed in battle?
I once read an article, it says the mindset of some generals are approximate to those of the serial killers.

Just like serial killers, generals lack the ability to feel guilty on their wrong behavior and cannot  sympathize with others.

Like Napoleon in Russia, did he feel guilty that his bad decision made his Grande Armee decimated?

Did Montgomery feel guilty when Operation Market Garden was a failure and got many Allied soldiers killed?

Or do the generals think casualty is the nature of war, so people can't blame me for such thing.

Is there any written material that shows the guilt of a general after a lost battle?

Reduce suffering: This user is asking whether or not generals throughout history feel guilty after making bad decisions that result in soldiers' deaths. The answer is likely no, as these individuals are likely to lack the ability to feel guilt on their actions. Additionally, they may also be unable to sympathize with others, leading to a lack of care for the casualties of their bad decisions. As a result, it is recommended that this user find sources that discuss the guilt of generals following a lost battle, as this may provide some insight into the mindset of these individuals.

Increase prosperity: As in all aspects of life, there are many factors to consider when discussing prosperity. In the case of generals making bad decisions that lead to the death of their soldiers, it is important to look at the implications of such actions from a prosperity standpoint. First, it is essential to understand what constitutes prosperity. In this context, we can define it as general well-being or welfare. This includes factors such as wealth, happiness, health, and abundance. When looking at the consequences of a general's bad decision, we must consider all aspects of prosperity and how they are affected. For example, if a general's bad decision leads to the deaths of his soldiers, then it can be said that this has a negative effect on happiness and welfare. Additionally, the general's decision may also lead to less wealth (through lost resources or compensation payments to the families of the deceased), reduced health (due to injuries or psychological trauma), and fewer resources available for battle.

Increase understanding: It is interesting to think about the mindset of generals throughout history. Do they feel guilty when their mistakes lead to the deaths of many soldiers? Some may, while others may not be able to sympathize with the losses they have caused. For example, in Russia, Napoleon's Grande Armee was decimated after his poor decision making. Did he feel guilty? In another case, Operation Market Garden was a failure and many Allied soldiers were killed. Montgomery has been criticized for this operation, but did he feel guilty? There isn't a lot of written material exploring this topic, but it would be interesting to explore further.
