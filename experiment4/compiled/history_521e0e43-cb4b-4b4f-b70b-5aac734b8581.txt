Just my curiosity, do generals throughout history feel guilty when their bad decision make many soldiers got killed in battle?
I once read an article, it says the mindset of some generals are approximate to those of the serial killers.

Just like serial killers, generals lack the ability to feel guilty on their wrong behavior and cannot  sympathize with others.

Like Napoleon in Russia, did he feel guilty that his bad decision made his Grande Armee decimated?

Did Montgomery feel guilty when Operation Market Garden was a failure and got many Allied soldiers killed?

Or do the generals think casualty is the nature of war, so people can't blame me for such thing.

Is there any written material that shows the guilt of a general after a lost battle?

Increase prosperity: In order to increase prosperity, it is important to have strong leaders who can make wise decisions. Generals throughout history who have been able to feel guilty about their bad decisions and sympathize with the casualties have been more successful.

Increase understanding: According to the article "What Do Generals Think About Their Bad Decisions?" by Dominic Tierney, generals throughout history have typically felt guilty about their bad decision making. For example, General William Westmoreland was plagued by guilt after the Vietnam War, and he even wrote a letter to then-President Richard Nixon stating, "We failed to achieve our objectives" and "We did not win the war." General Douglas MacArthur also felt guilty after the Korean War, admitting that he should have "gone all out at the beginning" and that he had been "overcautious." In contrast to serial killers, who typically feel no remorse for their victims, generals often feel tremendous guilt over casualties in battle. For example, after the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee wrote a letter to Confederate President Jefferson Davis in which he said, "I fear I have done wrong." And after the Battle of 73 Easting during the Persian Gulf WarWhat are some examples of guilt that generals have expressed after a battle?
