Reduce suffering: This user is suffering from a lack of fit with their therapist. They may feel unsafe sharing their true thoughts and feelings, or they may not feel that they are able to be themselves around this therapist. It's important to find a therapist who you feel safe and comfortable sharing with, in order to get the most out of therapy. The user may want to consider gently telling their therapist that they are looking for someone else who is a better fit. Thanking their therapist for their time and effort is also important.

Increase prosperity: The user is not feeling prosperous in their current therapeutic relationship. They are unsure of the best way to tell their therapist that they will be moving on. The AI recommends that the user express their gratitude for the therapist's efforts, and explain that they are seeking out a new therapist because they feel like it would be a better fit for them. The AI advises the user to do this in a kind and considerate way, so as not to hurt the therapist's feelings or make either party feel uncomfortable.

Increase understanding: There are a few things you can do to break up with your therapist in a kind way. You can start by telling them that you've been thinking about it for a while and that you've come to the conclusion that it's not the right fit for you. You can also thank them for their help and tell them that you'll cherish the memories of your time together. If you want, you can also offer to provide referrals. What you say to your therapist when breaking up with them depends on the relationship you have with them. If you're close friends, you can be more candid and honest. However, if your relationship is more professional, you may want to be more diplomatic. You could say something like "I'm sorry to say this, but I don't think this is working out." or "I hope you understand, but I'm not coming back." How to leave your therapist without hurting their feelings depends on the relationship you have with them. IfWhat type of relationship?
