Reading The Intelligent Investor in 2021
I'm currently reading the 4th edition of The Intelligent Investor. Although written some 40 years ago I've still had this book recommended  to me the most. But still, 40 years is a long time.

Are there any differences in terminology/theories/trends/statements  from today that I should be wary of while reading? 

Also, how should I read this book in order to get the most out of it? Comparing and contrasting graphs/charts of then and now? simply trying to memorize terminology? etc. Thanks in advance.
