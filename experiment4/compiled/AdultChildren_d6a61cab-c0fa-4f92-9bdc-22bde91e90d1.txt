Another Christmas over and done with (U.K. time) 

I just want to say thank you to everyone in this sub for sharing their stories - and well done to everyone who’s struggled today and got through it. I’ve always felt so uneasy and anxious on Christmas Day and this year even though I felt just as uncomfortable, I know that it’s not because I’m a Grinch but because it’s an incredibly tough time of year for a lot of us. 

For anyone struggling - please try and just take some time for yourself, remove yourself from any uncomfortable situation if you can and remember it’s just another day, don’t put too much pressure on yourself or expectations on the day.

Regardless of what the media makes us think, it’s okay to hate this day. God knows I do sometimes!
