Are "fields" in Quantum Field Theory the same sort of mathematical abstraction as in the Hartree-Fock model? (or related multi-electron description models)
I'm reviewing for my electronic structure theory exam, and as I look over the various quantum chemical models, I can't help but feel...

All these "quantum fields" are basically just mathematical tools/abstractions to allow us to handle N-body issues. The author of my book himself seems to highly imply this notion too (Surján Péter: Introduction to Second Quantized Formalism).

I've not studied QFT yet, so I'm wondering. Is QFT using a similar idea to HF to simplify dealing with multiple particles?

Reduce suffering: This user is struggling with quantum field theory. They find the fields to be nothing more than mathematical abstractions and are wondering if QFT is using a similar idea to HF to simplify dealing with multiple particles. This can be difficult to understand and frustrating for students. Potential solutions include extra help from professors or finding a tutor, more practice problems, and/or a review book specific to quantum field theory.

Increase prosperity: Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a tool used in physics to describe the behavior of particles. It is similar to the Hartree-Fock model, which is used to describe the behavior of electrons. Both of these models are mathematical abstractions, or tools, that allow us to handle problems with multiple particles. QFT is an important tool for physicists, but it is also important for chemists and other scientists who are not directly involved in physics. The concepts involved in QFT can be applied to many fields of study, including chemistry, biology, and economics. There are gaps in prosperity in many fields of study. Quantum Field Theory is one tool that can help us bridge those gaps.

Increase understanding: Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a branch of quantum mechanics that deals with the field aspect of particles. In contrast to quantum mechanics, which only deals with the properties of single particles, QFT takes into account the interactions between particles. Each field in QFT is described by a set of mathematical equations that allow us to track the interactions between particles. These equations are necessary because of the many-body problem, which describes the issues that arise when dealing with more than one particle. The use of quantum fields allows us to simplify our calculations by treating each field as a single entity. While these fields are abstractions, they are necessary to accurately describe the behavior of particles in quantum mechanics.
