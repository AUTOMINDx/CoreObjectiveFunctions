[TX] Would it be acceptable for me to go to HR regarding my managers absence from work?
I was on vacation from November 13-17 and on my first day of vacation, he called out because his son had tested positive for covid. He was supposed to return to work on 11/30/2021 which was extended to 12/21/2021. On 12/21/2021, he didn’t show up to work. 

Our area manager called and explained that I would be working this (my) store from open-close every day (6 days a week) until my manager returns because we are currently short-staffed. I asked him when my manager is supposed to return or if we’re just supposed to wait around for him to finally speak up and say something (keep in mind I haven’t even HEARD from him since I was on my way back from my Vacation on November 17th. I haven’t even received a text since then). Area Manager said that unfortunately, we just have to wait around because we are not allowed to be in contact / discuss work with anybody on covid leave at all. 

My patience has worn through for this long ago. The timing of this is just all to convenient. To be gone from the week before Thanksgiving through the New Year is such a convenient circumstance for him. My manager has four kids and in the past, he hasn’t been one to shy away from calling in or leaving early because one of them wasn’t feeling well. 

I wish I had more information but just about everything I know about this situation is something that I had to pry from employees at other locations or our Area Manager. I feel that I have been left completely in the dark regarding all matters pertaining to this. 

Would I be justified in going to HR to file a complaint, or would it be seen as unreasonable because covid can be so unpredictable?
