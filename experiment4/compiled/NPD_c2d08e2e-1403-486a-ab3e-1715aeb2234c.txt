Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

blade Runner
I feel like I’m a replicant. Since I don’t really seem to have a true sense of a core personality (other than like pure negativity and a downer of a position), often I catch myself emulating the traits of other people, to a tee. It’s like I catch them in myself. I’m sure in psychological terms it’s called mirrorring and is a part of being an underdeveloped person. To what extent is it normal, i.e. as is often said, you are the combination of the 5 persons you hang out with…yet I concurrently sense it being way more than that. 

When watching the modern Blade Runner, it just hit me like a ton of bricks how I’m basically exactly like a replicant, with all the similar attributes they have, envy of those who are “real” and authentic. I’m basically a chameleon and adjust my skin to my surroundings. Some skins just feel way more familiar than others. In truth an amalgam, ghastly, a spectre.

Reduce suffering: This user suffers from a sense of not being authentic or real. They feel that they copy the personality traits of others, and this leads to them feeling like a replicant or spectre. This may be due to problems with identity development, or to difficulties with socializing and relating to others. Recommended solutions include therapy or counseling, as well as exploring different social circles to find people who share more of the user's interests and values.

Increase prosperity: 1. Spend time with people who are positive and have a healthy outlook on life. 2. Avoid negative people, as they will only bring you down. 3. Set goals for yourself and work towards them. 4. Be grateful for what you have, even if it is not much. 5. Be proactive and take control of your life.

Increase understanding: 1. In psychology, mirroring is when a person copies the facial expressions, gestures, or body posture of another person. It is often seen in infants who are trying to learn how to behave in social situations. Mirroring can also be a sign of empathy and connection, as when two people share the same emotions or experiences. 2. Characteristics of a replicant are that they are often physically identical to the person they are imitation, they have a limited life span, and they usually have some sort of emotional response to their experiences. Replicants were first introduced in the movie Blade Runner, where they were synthetic humans created for slave labor. 3. To know if you are a chameleon, you need to answer two questions: first, do you change your appearance or behavior depending on who you are around? Second, do you feel like you're pretending to be someone else? If the answer to either question is yes, then you likely have some4. Being underdeveloped can manifest in a variety of ways, depending on the person. Common signs include having a low self-esteem, being shy and introverted, being unsure of oneself, and struggling with social interaction. Some people may also have trouble dealing with emotions, or they may be overly emotional.
