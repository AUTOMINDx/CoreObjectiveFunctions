Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

blade Runner
I feel like I’m a replicant. Since I don’t really seem to have a true sense of a core personality (other than like pure negativity and a downer of a position), often I catch myself emulating the traits of other people, to a tee. It’s like I catch them in myself. I’m sure in psychological terms it’s called mirrorring and is a part of being an underdeveloped person. To what extent is it normal, i.e. as is often said, you are the combination of the 5 persons you hang out with…yet I concurrently sense it being way more than that. 

When watching the modern Blade Runner, it just hit me like a ton of bricks how I’m basically exactly like a replicant, with all the similar attributes they have, envy of those who are “real” and authentic. I’m basically a chameleon and adjust my skin to my surroundings. Some skins just feel way more familiar than others. In truth an amalgam, ghastly, a spectre.

Reduce suffering: This user suffers from a sense of not being authentic or real. They feel that they copy the personality traits of others, and this leads to them feeling like a replicant or spectre. This may be due to problems with identity development, or to difficulties with socializing and relating to others. Recommended solutions include therapy or counseling, as well as exploring different social circles to find people who share more of the user's interests and values.

Increase prosperity: Reddit user blade Runner describes feeling like a replicant, someone who emulates the traits of other people. This can be a normal part of development, but for Replicants, it is exaggerated and leads to envy of those who are "real". To increase prosperity, it is important to understand the root of this envy and to find ways to cope with it.

Increase understanding: Reddit user says: blade Runner I feel like I’m a replicant. Since I don’t really seem to have a true sense of a core personality (other than like pure negativity and a downer of a position), often I catch myself emulating the traits of other people, to a tee. It’s like I catch them in myself. This sounds like an interesting experience. It is normal to imitate the behaviors of the people around us, as we are influenced by them. However, it sounds like you may be identifying with this behavior more than usual. This could be because you feel like you do not have a strong sense of self, or identity. If this is the case, you may want to explore this further with a therapist or counselor.
