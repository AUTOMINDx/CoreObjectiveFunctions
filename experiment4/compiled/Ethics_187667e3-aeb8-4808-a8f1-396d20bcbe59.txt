Process the Core Objective Functions (reduce suffering, increase prosperity, increase understanding) on the following scenario:

Infection by negligence
TLDR CPS worker actions may lead to death of newborn infant and claims policy doesn't allow a different outcome other than potential death.

Set scene, you are a child protective services worker.  You are directly responsible for the immediate health and wellbeing of the children in your care. The child has  been immune comprised and respiratory system compromised due to previous illness while in your custody and due to the age of only 4.5 months old. 
Your follow policy and procedure and house the child with a foster parent. The fosters have agreed to follow your orders to the letter.  
Now the variables,  first foster parent becomes infected with covid and is showing symptoms.  What do you do to ensure the welfare of the child? Follow policy. The policy states follow PCP recommendations. PCP states to leave the infant with the covid positive foster for five continuous days before even confirming the child has covid already and only if the child shows symptoms.  Yes this is against CDC guidelines.
Further variables, ceastion of communication with biological parents due to the fact your now on vacation and you no longer care about your work. The biological parents must now face the holidays knowing that the last time they saw their child may very well be the last time they will ever see their child and no recourse is available to grieve against. Foster parent 2 is now also covid positive and the child is still in the covid household.
Department policy states to leave the child in danger of covid infection despite the high chance that death may ensue from the inability to have appropriate immune system response of the child. You claim your just following the department policy and there is nothing that can be done to alter the situation into one favorable to the welfare of the child. You claim your eliminating the chance of further spread of covid by not removing the child before infection despite not showing symptoms.  You refuse to do any covid test until afyerb5 days of continuous exposure to a virus that is known to infect in less than 15 minutes. All this while knowing if the child gets infected he has high probability of the situation becoming critical if not fatal for the infant child. 
Parents state they want the child moved into safe housing away from covid. Parents claim you are sentencing their child to death and accuse you of attempting negligent homicide. Your concern is now your feeling offense from the accusation. 
Now with the facts as laid before you, is this an ethical situation in which one can assume ethical and unethical behavior and policy? Are you an ethical person in this scenario and what would you do differently if you were to be given free range within limits of policy? What if you were allowed to call your policy into question and violate that policy due to its ethical or unethical status?

Reduce suffering: The Reddit user is describing a situation in which a child is at risk of death due to the actions of Child Protective Services workers. It is speculated that the workers are following department policy, which requires them to leave the child in danger of contracting Covid despite the high chance of death. The parents of the child accuse the workers of attempted negligent homicide. It is unclear whether or not the workers are acting ethically in this scenario. If given free range within the limits of policy, they may choose to violate policy in order to protect the child.

Increase prosperity: In this situation, the child's welfare is potentially in danger due to exposure to Covid. There are two potential courses of action: follow policy and put the child at risk of death, or violate policy in order to protect the child. If the child does become infected, there is a high probability that they will die. Even if the child does not become infected, there is still a high chance that they will die from other causes related to Covid infection. There are several gaps in prosperity here. The first gap is between the health and wellbeing of the child and the department's policy. The department's policy puts the child at risk of death, while the child's health and wellbeing should be the top priority. Another gap is between the health and wellbeing of the child and the actions of CPS workers. CPS workers should do everything in their power to keep the child safe, but in this situation they are not doing so. Finally, there is a gap between the health and

Increase understanding: In this scenario, the child has been exposed to Covid and is at risk of death if left in the care of a Covid-positive foster parent. However, department policy dictates that the child may only be removed from the home if they show symptoms of the virus. This leaves the child in a high-risk situation, as they are unable to receive appropriate medical care and are instead exposed to the virus for an extended period of time. The parents argue that this leaves their child with a very high chance of death, and accuse the worker of attempted negligent homicide. unethical policy leaves child in danger
