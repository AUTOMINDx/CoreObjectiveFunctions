In order to increase prosperity, it is important to focus on your physical appearance. Men should make sure they are physically attractive to women, by working out and taking care of their hygiene. Women should focus on their looks as well, by dressing well and taking care of their skin and hair. Social media apps like TikTok can be harmful to your self-esteem and confidence, so it is important to be aware of the negative impact they can have. It is also important to remember that looks are not everything, and men can still be successful with women if they have a good personality and confidence.
