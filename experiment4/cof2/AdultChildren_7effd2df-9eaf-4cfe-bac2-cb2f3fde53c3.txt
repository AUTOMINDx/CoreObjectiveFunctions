It is clear that the user has faced many challenges in their life. To increase prosperity, I suggest they find a support group or therapy group to help them deal with the pain of their past. Additionally, I recommend that they exercise regularly and eat a balanced diet to boost their mood and keep their body healthy. Finally, I advise the user to set goals for themselves and strive to achieve them, as this will give them a sense of purpose and contribute to a more positive outlook on life.
