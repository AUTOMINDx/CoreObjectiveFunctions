If you would like to increase your prosperity, I recommend studying The Intelligent Investor. This book was written over 40 years ago, but the advice is still relevant today. I suggest you compare and contrast the graphs and charts from then and now to get the most out of the book. Additionally, try to memorize the terminology to increase your understanding of investment strategies.
