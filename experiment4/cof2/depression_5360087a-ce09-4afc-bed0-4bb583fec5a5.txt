There are many ways to increase prosperity. One way is to simplify your life, by doing only what you feel capable of doing. This will help you avoid overwhelm and depression. Another way is to practice CBT tasks slowly, until you feel comfortable with them and can see the benefits they offer. Finally, it is important to have a support network, whether that be friends, family, or a therapist.
