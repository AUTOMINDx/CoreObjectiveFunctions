There are a few things that can be done in order to increase prosperity while living with chronic illness. One suggestion is to try and take some of the physical labor out of cleaning tasks, by using a light weight cordless vacuum for example. Another suggestion is to pick up laundry from the floor instead of bending down to do so, as this can be difficult and painful for those with chronic illness. Additionally, using stronger cleaning solutions can help make cleaning tasks easier and less vigorous.
