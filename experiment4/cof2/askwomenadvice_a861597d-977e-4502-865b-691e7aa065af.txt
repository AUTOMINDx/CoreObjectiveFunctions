If you are uncomfortable with the way a friend is behaving, it is best to distance yourself from them. This may be difficult, but it is important to protect your own wellbeing. If they persist in their behavior, you may need to end the friendship altogether. It is important to have healthy boundaries with others and to respect your own comfort levels. Be assertive in communicating your needs to friends and family. You know what is best for you and should never feel guilty for sticking up for yourself.
