There are a few things that you can do to increase your prosperity in your career. First, consider looking for positions that do not require you to manage a team of people. Alternatively, look for roles where you can manage a team of people indirectly, or where the team is relatively small. You may also want to focus on developing your skills in management and leadership, so that you are better equipped to take on a management role if necessary. Finally, consider seeking out mentors and coaches who can help you grow and develop as a professional.
