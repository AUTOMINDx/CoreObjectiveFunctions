In order to increase prosperity, it is important to have a strong support network of close friends and family who will be there for you through thick and thin. If you are struggling with your identity, it is crucial to have people you can talk to about it who will not judge you. It is also important to be honest with yourself and acknowledge your feelings. Finally, keep in mind that there is no one right way to live your life, and do what makes you happy.
