If you are experiencing racist behavior, our advice is to remove yourself from the situation as calmly and safely as possible. It can be difficult to confront someone who is behaving in a racist way, but it is important to do so when possible. There are many resources available to help with this, including hotlines and support groups. Remember that you are not alone, and there are people who want to help. Additionally, we recommend that you keep a journal of your experiences, both to document what has happened and to help keep track of your progress in dealing with these situations. Finally, we advise you to reach out for professional help if the racism is proving too much to handle on your own.
