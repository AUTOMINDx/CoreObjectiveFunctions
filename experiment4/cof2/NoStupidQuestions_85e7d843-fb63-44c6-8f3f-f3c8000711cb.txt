It is contradictory that the US govt places so much importance on its military, while allowing a high percentage of its veteran population to be homeless. To increase prosperity, the US govt should focus on ensuring that all military veterans have access to adequate housing and support services. This would be a concrete way to show appreciation for their service, and would help to ensure that all veterans are able to thrive.
