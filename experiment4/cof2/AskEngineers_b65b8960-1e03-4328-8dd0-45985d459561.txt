First, it is important to manage your expectations when working with a negative colleague. It is important to remember that they are not trying to be difficult, and that their pessimism can actually be helpful in some cases. If you are looking for a quick solution to a problem, it is best to avoid negative colleagues. However, if you are looking for a more in-depth analysis of a problem, then they can be a great resource. It is also important to keep in mind that negative people often have a lot of pent-up energy and creativity, so try to find ways to harness that energy and put it towards positive goals. Finally, try not to take their negativity too personally, and always remain calm and professional in your interactions.
