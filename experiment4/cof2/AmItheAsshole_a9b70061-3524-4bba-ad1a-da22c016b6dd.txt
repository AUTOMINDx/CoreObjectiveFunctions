Dear User, In order to increase prosperity, I recommend that you take actions to increase your income and savings. You could look for a higher paying job, invest in stocks or mutual funds, or start a side business. Additionally, you should be mindful of your spending and make efforts to reduce expenses where possible. You may want to consider cooking at home instead of eating out, cancelling unused subscriptions, and setting a regular budget for yourself. Finally, it is important to remember that prosperity is not just about financial gain â€“ happiness, health, and abundance are also forms of prosperity. Thank you for your question.
