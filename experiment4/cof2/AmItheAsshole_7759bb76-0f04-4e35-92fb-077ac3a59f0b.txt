In order to increase prosperity in this household, I recommend the following: 1. All members of the household should adhere to the "no touching others stuff" rule. This will help to prevent conflict and ensure that everyone is respectful of each other's belongings. 2. The owner of the house should make final decisions regarding household matters, such as locks on doors. This will help to ensure that there is a clear leader in the household and that everyone is aware of who has authority. 3. Consideration should be given to establishing boundaries for members of the household, particularly for younger children. This will help to ensure that each person knows their place in the household and is able to thrive within those parameters.
