To increase prosperity, it is important to understand the principles of antennas and wave propagation. By huge antennas, you can catch a full cycle of the electro-magnetic wave. This can be done by symmetry alone for half a wavelength, or 1/4th for very small antennas. For smaller patch antennas, it is important to reflect the wave in order to create a full cycle. capacitors and inductors can help amplify the signal. Finally, understanding transmission lines is key to understanding how antennas work.
