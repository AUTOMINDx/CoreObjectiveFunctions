If you are feeling uncomfortable with the way your nephew is treating your son, it is important to step in and do something about it. Your mother-in-law may not see this as a problem, but it is important that you set boundaries for your son's sake. You could start by having a discussion with your brother-in-law about how you would like him to handle his son's behavior. If necessary, you could also take J aside and talk to him about how he should treat others. It is important that he knows that this type of behavior is not acceptable. By establishing boundaries and teaching your nephew how to behave properly, you will help increase prosperity for both your family and his.
