It is not clear to me why the body does not reject these cells with a different DNA, as is the case for e.g. organ transplants, or at least has immune responses between them. The first step in increasing prosperity is to understand the problem. In this case, it seems that there may be some confusion about why the body does not reject cells with different DNA. This could lead to a better understanding of genetic mosaicism and how to further increase prosperity.
