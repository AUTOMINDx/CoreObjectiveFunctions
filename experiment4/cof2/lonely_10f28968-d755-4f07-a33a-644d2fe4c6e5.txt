If you feel lonely and have no friends, here are some recommendations to increase your prosperity. First, try to find social events for people in your age group or hobby group. Alternatively, try online dating or meetup.com to find groups of people with similar interests. Second, stay positive and focus on the good things in your life. It can be helpful to keep a list of things you are grateful for. Finally, reach out to others for support. Talk to family and friends about how you're feeling, or talk to a therapist.
