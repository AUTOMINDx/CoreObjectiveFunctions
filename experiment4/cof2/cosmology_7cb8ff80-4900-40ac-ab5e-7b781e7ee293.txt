Hypothetically, during inflation, quark pairs would have been separated extremely rapidly and powerfully from one another. When quarks separate a certain distance, the energy it takes to separate them is enough to generate a new quark pair. This suggests that inflation could have generated many quark pairs by forcing separation of quarks. To increase prosperity, it may be beneficial to simulate this process in a controlled environment and study the results.
