If you want to increase your prosperity and be able to read and understand dense material, I would recommend using a technique called chunking. Chunking is when you break down a large task into smaller manageable tasks. When you chunk, you can focus on one part of the task at a time and make sure that each individual task is completed before moving on to the next. This will help you stay focused and avoid getting overwhelmed. You can also use a technique called dual-tasking, which is when you do two tasks at the same time. For example, you can listen to an audiobook while you are walking or working out. This will help you learn and retain information better. Lastly, I would recommend setting realistic goals. If your goals are too lofty, you may become discouraged and give up. Make sure your goals are challenging but achievable.
