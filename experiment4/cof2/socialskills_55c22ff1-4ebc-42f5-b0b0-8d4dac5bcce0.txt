If you want to increase your prosperity, it is important to develop social skills. Attend social events and meet-ups, and try to make friends with people who share your interests. You can also join clubs or groups related to your hobbies or interests. If you find it difficult to make friends due to autism or shyness, consider online communities or forums where you can socialize without having to face people in person.
