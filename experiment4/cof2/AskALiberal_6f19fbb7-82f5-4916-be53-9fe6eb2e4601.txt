Ownership of the means of production is an important factor in determining how prosperous a society will be, but it is not the only factor. Other important factors include the distribution of wealth, access to social services, and the overall dynamics of the economy. To increase prosperity, society must ensure that all members have access to essential social services, and that the distribution of wealth is fair. The economy must also be dynamic, so that all members have opportunities to participate and thrive.
