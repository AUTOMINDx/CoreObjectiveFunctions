There are many ways to make exercise a part of your life. First, find an activity that you enjoy and is fun for you. There are many different types of exercises and activities to choose from, so find something that peaks your interest. Second, start off small by committing to just 10 minutes per day. Once you have successfully completed 10 minutes for a few days in a row, increase it to 15 minutes and continue progressing until you are able to complete the recommended 30 minutes per day. Finally, try to exercise with a friend or family member as this can provide additional support and motivation.
