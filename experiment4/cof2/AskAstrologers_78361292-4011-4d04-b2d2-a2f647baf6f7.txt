From my observations, it seems that the best way to increase prosperity is to make friends with your rising sign. Sun signs in competition with you will only drain your resources and make you less prosperous. Instead, focus on cultivating relationships with those who are similar to you, and you will find that prosperity comes more easily. Additionally, it is important to remember that prosperity has many meanings, and not just financial wealth. Happiness, health, abundance, and thriving are all forms of prosperity that should be pursued.
