I would recommend taking the pay cut for a more appealing job. It is important to be happy in your work, and this may be a sign that you are not content in your current position. The extra work hours may be difficult, but they would be paid hours, which is a plus. I think it is worth it to take the pay cut in order to have a more fulfilling career.
