If you are struggling with anxiety, I suggest eliminating processed foods, grains, added sugars, and diet cola from your diet. Replace these foods with healthy alternatives such as salads, chicken, sweet potatoes, cous cous, lentils, nuts, fruit, and vegetables. If you have a gluten sensitivity, I recommend eliminating gluten from your diet. If you have an itchy/dandruffy scalp or rosacea problem, I suggest consulting a doctor to see if there is a non-diet related cause.
