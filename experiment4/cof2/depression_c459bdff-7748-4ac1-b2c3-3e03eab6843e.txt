There are many things that can be done to increase prosperity. One approach is to focus on Real Me and work to make her life better. This may involve providing support, such as counseling or mentorship, and helping her to build stronger relationships with others. Additionally, it may be helpful to provide her with opportunities for growth and enrichment, such as educational programs or vocational training. Another approach is to focus on Work Me and help her to become even more successful. This could involve coaching or training to improve her skills, supporting her professional development, and providing opportunities for recognition and reward. Ultimately, it is important for both Real Me and Work Me to feel happy and fulfilled in order to achieve prosperity.
