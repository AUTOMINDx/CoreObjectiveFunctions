If you find that you are not enjoying groups like ACA or Al-anon, it may be helpful to explore other groups that focus on topics that interest you. It is also important to find a group of people that you feel comfortable sharing your experiences with. When people share traumatic experiences, it is important to offer support and empathy. If you find that the group is competitive or unhelpful, it may be time to find a new group.
