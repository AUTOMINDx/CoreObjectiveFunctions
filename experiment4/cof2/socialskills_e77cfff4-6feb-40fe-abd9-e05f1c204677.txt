When meeting someone who seems to be able to connect to other people effortlessly and who everyone likes, it is important to be aware of the possibility of manipulation. There are a few things you can do in order to protect yourself from this type of person. First, be sure to ask them questions about themselves and really listen to their responses. This will help you get a sense of whether they are being genuine or not. Additionally, pay attention to how you feel when you are around them. Do they make you feel good? Or drained? If they make you feel good, then chances are they are authentic and worth your time. However, if they make you feel drained, it is best to steer clear.
