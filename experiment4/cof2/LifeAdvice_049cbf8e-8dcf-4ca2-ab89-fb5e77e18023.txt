It is understandable that you are feeling conflicted after receiving contact from your extended family. On one hand, it could be seen as a positive sign that they are reaching out after so many years of silence. On the other hand, you may have negative associations with them due to the treatment you received from your parents. Before making a decision, it is important to evaluate the motivations of your relatives and try to understand why they reached out now. If their intentions seem sincere, then it may be worth considering meeting up with them. However, if you have any doubts, it is best to err on the side of caution and avoid a potentially uncomfortable situation. No matter what you decide, always be honest with your sister about how you're feeling.
