There are many benefits to therapy, including increased prosperity. I recommend that you continue to go to therapy every couple of weeks, as it has clearly been beneficial for you. In addition, try to think about therapy in a different way. Rather than viewing it as a time when you focus exclusively on your problems, try to think of it as a time when you can take a step back and look at your life in a more positive and objective way. This can help you manage stress and anxiety more effectively and lead to a happier and more prosperous life.
