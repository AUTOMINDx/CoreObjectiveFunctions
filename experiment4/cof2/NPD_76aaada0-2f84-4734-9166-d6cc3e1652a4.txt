Pathological narcissism is a problem that can be solved through therapy and behavioural regulation. Recovery looks different for everyone, but it typically involves adapting healthy methods to regulate self esteem. This will lead to a happier, more fulfilling life with fewer urges to cause harm to others or oneself. Everybody has some degree of narcissism, but it's only a problem when it leads to maladaptive behaviours. A recovered narcissist that has good behavioural regulation is healthier than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.
