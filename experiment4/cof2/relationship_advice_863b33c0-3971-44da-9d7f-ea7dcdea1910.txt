When someone takes you out for lunch, it is customary to thank them for their gesture. In this situation, it would be polite to decline any sexual advances that the person makes. If the individual continues to pressure you for sex, it is best to end the date and leave. You should communicate with this person and let them know that you are not interested in a sexual relationship. If they persist, it may be best to avoid further interaction with this person.
