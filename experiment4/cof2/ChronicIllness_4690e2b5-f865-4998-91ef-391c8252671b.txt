If this situation is troubling to you, there are actions you can take to increase your prosperity. First, talk to your friends about why this content makes you uncomfortable. Let them know that it hurts your feelings when they share disability-related TikToks with you. If they are open to dialogue, they may be more mindful of what they share in the future. Additionally, you could unfollow any accounts that regularly post content that makes you feel bad. This will help you focus on content that makes you feel happy and prosperous. Finally, remember that your friends likely donâ€™t mean to hurt your feelings - they may just not be aware of how their content affects you. Try to be understanding and forgiving, and continue to work on building a community of support around you.
