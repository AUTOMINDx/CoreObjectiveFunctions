To increase prosperity, it is important to protect your artwork from being photographed. One way to do this is by using a panel that distorts photos. You could also use special ink that bends light with nanotech. However, this may be more difficult to achieve. Whatever method you choose, be sure to protect your artwork so that you can enjoy the benefits of prosperity.
