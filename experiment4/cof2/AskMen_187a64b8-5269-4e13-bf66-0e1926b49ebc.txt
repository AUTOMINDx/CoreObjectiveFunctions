There are many ways to increase prosperity. For starters, avoid clubs and loud bars. The prices for drinks are disgustingly overpriced, the music is obnoxious and too loud, and it's nearly impossible to have a conversation or pick up girls. It's also incredibly crowded and sweaty - not exactly the most enjoyable environment. Instead, try exploring different venues or activities that better fit your interests and personality. There are plenty of things to do and explore in this world, so find what makes you happy and go for it!
