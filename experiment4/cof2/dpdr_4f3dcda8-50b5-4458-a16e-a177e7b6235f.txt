When it comes to navigating social situations, it is important to remain mindful of your surroundings and the people you are interacting with. Try to be present in the moment and focus on the conversation at hand. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or panicking, take a deep breath and slowly exhale. It can also be helpful to have a mantra or positive affirmation that you can repeat to yourself when things start to feel tough.Whatever you do, don't give up. Just because derealization makes social interactions difficult does not mean that you cannot overcome them. With time and practice, you will get better at dealing with these situations. Keep your head up and remember that you are not alone.
