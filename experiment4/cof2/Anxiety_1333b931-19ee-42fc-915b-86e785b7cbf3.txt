You may find it helpful to talk to your loved ones about your anxiety in a more direct way. Try to explain what it feels like when you have an attack or breakdown, and how it impacts your daily life. It can be helpful for them to understand why you may seem unlike yourself at times. If they still don't seem to understand, try sharing articles or videos about anxiety that can help to illustrate what you are experiencing. Remember to be patient and compassionate with them, as they may only want the best for you. Ultimately, it is important that you feel understood and supported in your struggles.
