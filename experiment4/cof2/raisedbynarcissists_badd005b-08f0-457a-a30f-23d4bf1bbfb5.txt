Christmas is a time of giving, and your mother-in-law was only trying to do something nice for her new son. If you are unable to get along with her, it might be best to stay away from her during the holiday season. Instead, try to focus on your husband and make this a special time for the two of you. Maybe plan a trip to visit family or go on a romantic vacation. Whatever you do, don't let your mother-in-law spoil the joy of Christmas.
