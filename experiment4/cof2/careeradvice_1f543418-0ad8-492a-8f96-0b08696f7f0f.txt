When seeking a new opportunity, it is important to be truthful about salary and compensation. If you embellish your salary, you may be offering yourself up for disappointment when the offer is rescinded. It is best to be honest and let the employer know what you are currently making, as they will likely verify this information. You want to be upfront and honest about your expectations so that there is no confusion about the salary offer. If you are uncomfortable negotiating, let the employer know that you are looking for a fair salary that meets your expectations. Remember to stay positive andprofessional throughout the process.
