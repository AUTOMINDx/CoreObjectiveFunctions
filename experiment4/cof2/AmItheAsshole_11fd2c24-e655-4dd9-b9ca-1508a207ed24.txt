There are many ways to increase prosperity. Some methods are more effective than others. In this situation, the mother appears to be grieving extensively for her daughter who passed away. While it is important to remember and cherish the memory of the departed, it is also important to live in the present. Focusing too much on the past can prevent happiness and prosperity in the present. The mother should try to find a healthy balance between remembering her daughter and living her life. This can be difficult, but it is important. There are many ways to memorialize her daughter that do not involve making the grief "front stage." For example, she could create a space in her home for her daughter's memory, or talk about her daughter in a positive light without making everything about her death. Additionally, the mother should focus on her other two children. They are growing up and need their mother's attention. They should not have to live in the shadow of their sister who passed away.
