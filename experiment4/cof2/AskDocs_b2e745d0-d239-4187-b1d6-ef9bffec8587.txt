If the red spot on your grandson's face is growing in size or changing in appearance, it is important to get it checked out by a doctor. While it is possible that the spot is nothing serious, it is better to be safe than sorry. Until you know more, try to keep your grandson away from any potential allergens, such as pollen or pet dander. If he is scratching or rubbing the spot, applying a topical cream or ointment may help relieve any discomfort.
