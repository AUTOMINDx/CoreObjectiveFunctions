First and foremost, it is important to understand that there are many different definitions of prosperity. In this case, the user may feel that their prosperity has decreased, as their mother has not adjusted to their new pronouns properly. There are a few things that the user can do to increase their prosperity in this situation. Firstly, the user should continue to reinforce their pronouns and remind their mother of them. It is likely that with continued reminders, their mother will eventually adjust to using the correct pronouns. Secondly, the user could try communicating with their mother about why this change is important to them. This will help their mother to better understand why using the correct pronouns is important. Finally, if these measures do not seem to be working, the user could consider seeking out support from a therapist or another professional who can help them to manage this situation.
