If you are struggling with decision-making, there are a few things that you can do to increase your prosperity. First, try to simplify the choices that you have to make. If the options are too complex, it can be difficult for your brain to process them. Second, set a time limit for yourself. This can help to eliminate the paralysis by analysis that often comes with anxiety. Finally, get input from others. Ask your friends or family for their opinions on the matter, or seek out a professionalâ€™s advice. Seeking out support can be key in making decisions that will increase your prosperity.
