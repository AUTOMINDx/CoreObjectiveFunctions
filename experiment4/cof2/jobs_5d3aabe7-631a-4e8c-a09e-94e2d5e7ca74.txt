When asked about salary requirements, we recommend not giving an exact number, but instead providing a range that you are willing to work with. This will give you some negotiating power and prevent you from underselling yourself. Additionally, be sure to emphasize your skills and qualifications in order to justify a higher salary. Finally, always be prepared to walk away from a job opportunity that does not offer a fair wage.
