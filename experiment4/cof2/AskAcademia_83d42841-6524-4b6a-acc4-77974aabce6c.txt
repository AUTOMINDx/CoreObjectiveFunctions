1. Communicate with your advisor regularly, even if you are busy. Let them know about your work and any other newsworthy items. 2. If something comes up and you are unable to continue working on the project, let your advisor know as soon as possible. 3. Keep in touch with your advisor even after you graduate, especially if you are applying to PhD programs. They may be able to write a strong letter of recommendation for you.
