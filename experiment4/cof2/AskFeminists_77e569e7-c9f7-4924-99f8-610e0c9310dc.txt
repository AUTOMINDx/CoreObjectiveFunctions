It is my opinion that in order to increase prosperity, it is important to have strong female role models. The Loki TV series does a good job of portraying women as being independent and powerful. I would encourage more shows and movies to follow this example. Additionally, it is important to have open and honest communication between partners. The show also does a good job of portraying healthy relationships. I would recommend that others watch the Loki TV series as a way to learn how to increase prosperity.
