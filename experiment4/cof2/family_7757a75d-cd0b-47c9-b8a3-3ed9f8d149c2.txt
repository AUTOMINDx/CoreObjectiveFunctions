Parents should try to be more present in their child's life, even if they are busy working. They should be available to help with homework or provide support when needed. Parents should also try to understand their child and what makes them unique. Having an open dialogue can help bridge any gaps in understanding. Lastly, parents should not try to change their child into someone they are not, but accept them for who they are.
