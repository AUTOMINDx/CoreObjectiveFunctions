If you love philosophy and are passionate about it, then I would recommend following your heart and continuing to pursue a PhD in philosophy. Although the competition is tough, if you are dedicated to your studies and have a strong work ethic, then you have a chance of succeeding. It is important to be well-rounded in your knowledge of the subject and to be able to think critically and logically. There are many opportunities for those who have a PhD in philosophy, such as teaching or working in research. I encourage you to continue down this path if it is what you truly want, and don't be discouraged by the challenges that lie ahead.
