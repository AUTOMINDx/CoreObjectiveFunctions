There are many possible explanations for why the woman you spoke to did not seem interested in you after learning that you study computer science. One possibility is that she has negative associations with men in computer science due to the nerdy stereotypes that are often associated with the field. However, it is also possible that she is not interested in pursuing a relationship with someone who is studying a field that she perceives as financially lucrative. If you are looking to increase your prosperity, I recommend focusing on developing qualities that are appealing to women, such as being confident and having a strong sense of self-awareness. Additionally, it may be helpful to pursue a degree or career in a field that is not traditionally perceived as being "nerdy." This could help you avoid negative stereotypes and make yourself more attractive to potential romantic partners.
