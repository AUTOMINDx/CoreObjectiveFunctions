When you make your work available to the public, it can reach a wider audience and receive more downloads. This can help you gain recognition for your work and improve your career prospects. Additionally, it is important to focus on creating high-quality work that will be appreciated by others. You should also aim to build a platform where you can share your work with others. This can help you connect with other writers and professionals in your field. Finally, remember to be humble and appreciative of any recognition that you may receive.
