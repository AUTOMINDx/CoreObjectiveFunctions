In terms of increasing prosperity, it is generally recommended that you invest in assets that have a higher density than water. Honey is a good example of this, as it is more dense than water and can therefore displacement water more quickly. Other options include investing in assets with high surface tension, such as certain types of oil. Whatever you choose to invest in, make sure you do your research to get the best return on investment.
