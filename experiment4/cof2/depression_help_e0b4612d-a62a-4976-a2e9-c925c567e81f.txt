The user seems to be struggling with anxiety and loneliness. I would recommend that they find a support group or therapy session to help them deal with these issues. Additionally, I would recommend that the user find ways to engage in hobbies or activities that make them happy. This could be anything from reading, writing, painting, hiking, etc. By finding ways to engage in joyful activities, the user will be less likely to dwell on their anxieties, and more likely to experience prosperity.
