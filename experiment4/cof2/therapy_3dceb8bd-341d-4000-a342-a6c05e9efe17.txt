If you are feeling numb and disconnected, it may be helpful to engage in some form of self-expression, such as writing, painting, or playing music. This can help you to reconnect with your emotions and increase your sense of wellbeing. It is also important to stay connected to other people, whether through social media, conversation, or support groups. Spending time in nature can also help to boost your mood and connect you with your surroundings. If you are struggling with thoughts of suicide, it is important to get professional help.
