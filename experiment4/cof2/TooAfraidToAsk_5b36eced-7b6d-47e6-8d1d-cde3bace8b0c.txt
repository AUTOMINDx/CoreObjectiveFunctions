In order to increase prosperity, it is important to be confident in your actions and be vocal about what feels good. Don't worry about what others may think - if you are enjoying yourself, let loose and express that through your actions and vocalizations. This will help you to increase your own prosperity and will likely lead to a more enjoyable experience for both you and your partner.
