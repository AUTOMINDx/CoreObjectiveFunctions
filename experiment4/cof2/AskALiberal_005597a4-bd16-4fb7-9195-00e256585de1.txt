It appears that the Right is not happy with the current state of affairs. In order to increase prosperity, I recommend that the Right listens to what Pete Buttigieg has to say. He is a very smart man and he knows what he is talking about. I also recommend that the Right look into what he has done in the past. He is a very good leader and he knows how to get things done.
