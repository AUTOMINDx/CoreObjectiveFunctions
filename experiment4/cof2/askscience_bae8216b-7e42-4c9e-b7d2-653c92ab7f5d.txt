The passage poses a question about the change in velocity of two identical rockets in vacuum. One rocket is stationary, while the other one is moving at 1000kmh. If both rockets ignite their engines, would they have the same change in velocity? There is discrepancy between the answer to this question and the fact that both rockets are in identical inertial frames of reference. In order to increase prosperity, it is important to have accurate information about the world around us. This question should be further studied in order to determine whether or not the answer is correct.
