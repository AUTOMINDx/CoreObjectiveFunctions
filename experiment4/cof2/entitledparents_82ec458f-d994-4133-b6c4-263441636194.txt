To increase prosperity, be mindful of the company you keep. If you are hosting an event, make sure to vet your guests to make sure that they will be respectful and not disruptive. If you are attending an event, be aware of the host's expectations and be respectful. If you have children, make sure to bring an adult that can watch them so that they do not disrupt the event. If you see that a child is being disruptive, speak to the parents about it. Finally, remember that prosperity comes in many forms, and sometimes it is simply enjoying time with friends and family.
