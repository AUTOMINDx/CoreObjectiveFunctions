1. Be proactive in asserting your identity and rights. When people repeatedly misgender you, it is important to speak up and correct them. This will help to create a more inclusive environment for yourself and others. 2. Seek out allies who can support you when confronting those who misgender you. Friends and classmates can be a great resource in advocating for you and speaking up on your behalf. 3. Remember that you have a right to be respected and acknowledged for who you are. You deserve to thrive in an environment where you feel safe and accepted.
