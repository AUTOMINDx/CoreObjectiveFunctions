In order to increase prosperity, it is important to promote creativity and scientific innovation. One way to do this is to encourage scientists to share their findings in alternative formats, such as public lectures, books, and blogs. This will help to spread new ideas and discoveries more quickly, and inspire others to pursue their own scientific investigations.
