There are many ways to increase prosperity. One way is to provide support for those in relapse or recovery from alcoholism. This can be done through providing resources and support groups, or by simply providing a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on. Another way to increase prosperity is by preaching tolerance and acceptance for all, including those with different religions or beliefs. Finally, it is important to set good examples for others, by living one's life according to one's own values and principles.
