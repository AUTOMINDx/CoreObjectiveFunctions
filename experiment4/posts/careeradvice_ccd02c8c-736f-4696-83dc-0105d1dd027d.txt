Best way to explain 1-year "gap" (left desk job to take blue collar work during pandemic)
I'm trying to give my brother some advice on his current job search and would love any perspective on this!

Last year in November, he left his desk job as a GIS technician (fully remote) because he wanted to get out of the house and was losing his mind a bit during the pandemic. He had recently moved to a new city with a new job and he did not feel like he was being given the resources to succeed from his employer (hard to train remotely, no social outlet, minimal guidance, etc). He did not see a path to fixing this in a fully-remote environment. Up until now, he had been working in GIS jobs for about 4 years at 3 different companies.

In order to make ends meet, he ended up taking a job as a carpet cleaner. This allowed him to get out of the house everyday and get some physical exercise as well. 

After a year of this, he's decided he's had enough of the manual labor and is looking to move back into a GIS job, ideally with some in-office component so he can get out of the house, learn from others, and establish more of a social network. 

We are both wondering:

(1) What might be the best way to explain this sort of career move / GIS career gap in interviews? Should he just be honest? or does that paint the picture of someone who may not be cut out / sure about working a desk job? I know the pandemic is unprecedented times...

(2) How should he address this on his resume? Is it better to list nothing (1 year gap) or to show the carpet cleaning job? 

Any advice is much appreciated!!!
