Ive been suicidal for a quite a while please any advice is highly appreciated
My psychiatrist is putting me in a psychiatric hospital in a couple of weeks and i really dont want to go i just want to end it. everyday i look at how far the fall is gonna be wishing i gather whatever energy i have left to jump but i keep getting panic attacks. please if you have any tips as to how to live with bipolar or major depression i would really appreciate it.

EDIT: thank you all for taking the time to help a person in need i really needed all your advice, and i hope all of you live a happy life in which you thrive and succeed. i will try to get better, if not for me then for you and for my loved ones and my pet. thanks again.
