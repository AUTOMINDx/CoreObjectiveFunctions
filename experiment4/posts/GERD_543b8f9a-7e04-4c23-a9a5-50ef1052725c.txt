LINX - Reflux coming back few years later
I got my LINX and HH repair procedure done a few years ago and I’ve lived completely normal. I forgot about reflux and PPIs and the horror I lived through prior. However, during Thanksgiving this year, I overate a few meals. I got in the habit of eating more than usual for a couple weeks and during that time, my reflux came back. I’m on day 3 of PPIs to try and get things back to normal but it’s not working as well. I’m down to reducing food intake and eating small meals which has helped some. I have a sore throat again and wet burps. When I went through the period of overeating, my stomach felt like dull pain all day where I felt full for the most part. Has anyone else experienced this? I’m going crazy just feeling the small amount of reflux I’ve had. I feel like I messed things up but it’s not the first time I’ve overeaten either. I’m so confused.

Edit: A lot of the reflux symptoms have subsided. Now I have just burping and pressure in my upper abdomen along with a dry/sore throat. I think I have another hernia. LINX seems to be working still and keeping contents from coming up.
