I wanna stop whining and learn dammit. What books would you suggest to a guy in his 20s who has plenty to learn about relationships, developing a personality, not letting things get him down easily?
Yes before anyone says it I already go to therapy. Im tired of freaking whining and never listening. Im a 5’6 brown chubby virgin but one who’s gonna try to not be. What books will help me gain confidence, develop ideas for personality, learn more about relationships? Im doing the work by hitting the gym and going to school as well.

Edit: I love all the sweet comments. But it’s the words of the few that rung w me being brown and short means I’ll be someone who really won’t be deserving of love
