I just want to sleep forever
Sleep is the only thing I enjoy anymore. It's nothingness, like before I was born. It's nice too because there's no anxiety or feelings of dread. I wish I could just sleep whenever I wanted. Also I don't want to work anymore. It just seems pointless and it's something I'll have to do for decades and I'll probably be stuck doing my current job until I can retire. I don't have the motivation to work but I do it anyway. I have no idea what I want to do with my life.
