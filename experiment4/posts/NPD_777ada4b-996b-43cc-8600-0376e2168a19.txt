An overwhelming curse has struck me
I have got IT. After so long it finally struck me. My whole life I thought I could live without it, that it is just for weak people. I actually, fully convinced myself that I am something a lot better than those people who feel it. That it makes me special, more competent in life. I thought I could see things rationally, from a clear point of view.

It may sound like I'm experiencing love, but no. It's way worse. I have been struck by a terrible curse, a door which is now opened and can never be fully closed again.


I have experienced affective empathy. 


A lot. Too much. In such a short span of time it came out of nothing. Well I've been going hard on recovery from NPD so I know where it comes from, but still too much, too soon. How the fuck do normal people cope with this? It feels like a huge cloud of smoke has been lifted in front of my eyes. People are SO sad and that makes me sad. No that can't be, I was always the one more emotionally mature than everyone. Why do I feel like I know absolutely nothing? Why do I suddenly come to the revelation, that other people have it worse than me, that I'm not the chosen one.
For fucks sake I just got sad because I remembered that someone had a bad childhood. That's not me. 

But in fact - this is me. Although it feels fake, it's still the most real thing I've experienced in a long time. Somehow it feels like I'm actually connecting to the sentient beings I've only seen as my personal chess figures so far. 

I think I'm becoming human.
