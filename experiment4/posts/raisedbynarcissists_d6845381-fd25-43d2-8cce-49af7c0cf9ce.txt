The cycle is really breaking and I am so glad I'm not my parents...
Tonight was like any other night with my family (my N parents are thousands of miles away and extremely limited contact, we are a family of 3 who are doing everything we can to break the cycle of abuse). I went into the attached garage to get in the chest freezer to grab some frozen pizza for dinner, when I saw that the freezer door was left open. 

In my childhood this would have resulted in screaming, being beaten, made to eat the spoiled rotten food, and shamed for MONTHS and YEARS after. 

My 6 year old had left it open after being told she could grab an ice cream after finishing her dinner the night before. 

I took a deep breath, called everyone into the garage, and we peacefully explained what happened, and had her help us put the spoiled food into a garbage bag. We explained how much each item cost when she asked, and the loss was about 24 dollars in frozen pizzas, a bag of chicken, and some ground beef. Not yelling, just this is what happened, we need to focus on what we are doing and try not to have it happen again. 

She was upset that she had to throw away her favorite freezer pizzas and cried but, we explained we can get more on Friday when we get more groceries.

I am so proud that we worked through this like adults, and turned what would have been a moment of everlasting trauma for me, to a moment of learning for my daughter.

Today is a good day.

Edit; omg I love all of your replies, I'm crying here. Thank you all.
