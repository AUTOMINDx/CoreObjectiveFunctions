An interesting find in the Mojave desert. Are these ancient? Are they from a mesoamerican culture?
Here is the link to the finder's original post.

" **Found by my late father when he was a boy. Antelope Valley, Mojave Desert area. Hwy was being constructed. Picked up a handful of rocks to throw at his little sister while walking to school bus stop. One might be possibly a Foo Dog? Any thoughts, ideas or information is appreciated. \[2880x2880\]** "
