My parents are splitting up.
My parents are splitting up. I'm going with my mom to the west coast. (I'm on the east coast). I'm not sure how to feel about all things tbh.  I'm going to South Cali and I want to chase storms once I'm older. As  I'm learning complex radar now. How often are storms there if anyone knows? Back to my parents tho. I probably won't be able to see my dad often. I don't really know how to feel about all this. They started fighting because of my dad's business ventures a couple of years ago. I was  9. Now I'm 14.
