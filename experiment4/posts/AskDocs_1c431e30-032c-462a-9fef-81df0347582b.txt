I got diagnosed with covid today and I’m genuinely freaked out please reassurance is needed
I’m 21 Male I noticed sneezing a few days ago but today I went to get a covid test…it came back positive.   I feel super weak I feel extremely dizzy and my eyes show black dots when I stand up I’m lying in bed right now the room is spinning I have asthma and I feel really scared I usually don’t get scared over anything but this is definitely messing with my psyche the doctor didn’t seem worried when he told me Im positive he said to isolate for 10 days and stuff but seriously I’m nervous as fuck plus I have ASTHMA so I’m totally fucked I need some reassurance please
