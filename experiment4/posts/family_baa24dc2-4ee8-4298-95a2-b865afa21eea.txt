Is it weird that my (22 F) dad (57 M) makes comments about me having a nice butt?
My dad made comments about my butt being big (I guess nice part is implied) twice in front of my mom and brother over like 2 weeks lol. First time he said that I’d be good at a dance with my “big ole booty” and second time my brother said I looked Asian and he said I couldn’t be with “an ass like that”. My mom lightly scolded him for that one lol. He replied “What, I can’t state the obvious?”. Is this normal? Do other people’s fathers make comments like this lol? We’re not super close lol, we’re rebuilding a relationship that hasn’t really been strong since I was like 12 or 13.

(Edit) I guess he never said that it was “nice” exactly, just that it was big lol.
