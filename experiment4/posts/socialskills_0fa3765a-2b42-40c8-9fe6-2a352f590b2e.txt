How do I decline an invitation to hang out with people who I feel have excluded me for a long time?
There is a clique at my work that gets together quite often to party. They make up about a third of my coworkers but are also the people that I work with the most. I think we get along but I’ve never been invited in the three or so years I’ve been here. 

Recently we’ve had a lot of new hires and a couple of them have been invited to the Christmas gathering, including one who I’ve gotten to know better. She’s pretty confused as to why she was invited and asked me if I’d go with her. 

I would’ve been thrilled a few years ago as it would’ve been a nice way to get to know people. Now though, it’s hard not to feel like I’ve been intentionally excluded all this time and the thought of attending makes me extremely uncomfortable. 

Anyways, I told her to go and have fun but that I’m not personally interested. But I know this will come up again in the future and I don’t know how to navigate the conversation without sounding antisocial or bitter.
