my dog was hit by a car yesterday and died, and i have no one to talk to about it
i only had her for two months. she had a lot of issues, but was slowly getting better with her anxiety and fears of everything. i know it’s not my fault, but i feel i made her life worse by adopting her. she hid under my bed for the entire two months, but seemed to be slowly coming out of her shell.

i was going to spend christmas at the park with her. now i’ll spend it alone in my room. I moved from new york to florida in april and have no friends or family here. i moved so i could make friends, but turns out i can’t. the one friend i made here ended up moving two months ago and pretty much ghosted me. since i’m too shy to make friends, i adopted jojo to help me get out of the house more and have something to do besides working from home. since she was shy too, i thought we could help each other. 

i got so very frustrated with her, but she was only 3 and a half and had such a rough life, but was improving everyday. she was so, so, so sweet despite it all. i just want people to know she existed and she mattered to me :(

the only people that cared are my parents and a few twitter friends. i don’t know why bad things keep happening to me, but it’s hard to manage at this point
