What do you think of the concept of a continuously changing publication in the form of a website page?
How it would work is this:

\- You have a website page that explains a concept with the goal of providing the newest most accurate version of the information. 

\- Since science sometimes discovers new things or feedback is provided for clarification, this could be continuously changed to the page. 

\- People can mark a line in the text and add a comment suggesting an improvement or add sources that might disprove or align with the idea. 

\- Every time the page is updated with information, it becomes a new "version". 

\- A button on the page exist called "download document and citation" and the citation will include the name of the latest version that was downloaded. 

\- You will also have access to previous versions, where the text that has been changed is marked in a colour. 

Questions:

\- Do you think this is a good way of holding updated information and managing the citation?

\- Do you think this could be applied to academic publications as well? Where the feedback or new discoverings could be data added to a model inside the publication, and the publication would then automatically be updated and uploaded with this extra data using a coding programme. Next gen automated science? 

\- When would this be a good use and when would it be a bad use?
