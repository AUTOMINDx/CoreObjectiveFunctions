Would you consider this weird?
For reference, I am a 23 year old male. I will sometimes say things like "thank you sweetheart" or "thanks doll" and such to female staff at a checkout line, gas station, etc... I never put much thought into it until I was with my friend the other day and he told me I was weird for saying that because I am so young. Is this a thing only old people do? Am I wrong for doing this?

Edit: to add to this I grew up in a very, and I mean very small town in North Carolina. This is something I grew up saying and my friends and family back home all do the same. I live in Virginia now.

Edit 2 electric boogaloo: I also call guys at work (I work in an all male environment) or in public, depending in context, baby and honey and what not. Ex. (What's up baby?) (Yes honey). I have never heard any negative argument from them or random guys. I admit I don't use doll as much if at all to male or female as I don't like the way it rolls off my tongue.

Edit 3: okay, I have had enough people call me misogynistic or sexist or tell me fuck you or call me a creep for one day. You can stop adding comments to this now please, I'm tired of getting notifications. I thought the first rule of this sub was to be kind. If a mod sees this please lock this thread so I don't have to hear my phone beep every 2 minutes. Thanks for your engagement everyone and as always be kind!
