25 years of my life.
Spent living in a small, lonely, dark box. Tucked away to the corner of my brain.

6 months out of that place of depression.

6 months straight I’ve woke up a happy person.

Woke up WANTING TO LIVE.
(A feeling I’ve never had before 6 months ago) and will never lose.

I FUCKING DID IT

I kicked depression THE FUCK out of my life.

I’m now a happy person always and forever.

Thanks world y’all are my 🪨

You can do it also, NEVER give up on yourself, No matter what anybody tells you, don’t stop believing in yourself/ don’t stop trusting in the constant.

1mind/1body/1soul.

Your heart beat. 

❤️

Edit: I should also share that// overcoming my anxiety in life is what brought me to this. And Reddit always helped me when I needed help and Reddit didn’t know it. 🙌🏼

Edit2: Yo I woke up this morning 12/20/21 balling my eyes out over the love and positivity y’all sent back my way. I’m just trying to get on a stage and share my life story. And all my funny stories.

My name is Jared look out for me on a stage near you someday soon. ❤️♟💎
