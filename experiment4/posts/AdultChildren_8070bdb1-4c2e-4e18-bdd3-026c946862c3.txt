I cant sleep and i am nervous
My family has always celebrated Christmas on the 24th. With a big dinner and presents. Dinner has always had alcohol. I told my mom I wouldn’t come this year if they would drink, she told me that they wouldn’t. Yesterday I came over with some presents and I saw that my dad had bought booze. I am mortified and I know they can’t keep their promise. I have nowhere else to go, except stay in my apartment. I am debating on going but leaving if they start to drink. Each of my siblings slept there but I didn’t and my mom told me to sit alone like an idiot at home because I didn’t want to sleep over. I have currently slept a total of 2 hours because I am anxious. I feel broken and every single childhood Christmas Eve filled with fights, blood, broken glass and screaming fights is playing on repeat in my head. I feel terrible. I want my presents but they are all under the tree and I feel so alone. Nobody gets me in my local town. I always work in Christmas but this time I don’t.
