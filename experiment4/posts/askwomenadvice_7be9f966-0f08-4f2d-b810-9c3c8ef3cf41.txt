How to tell someone to stop touching you without sounding like an idiot
I (25 F) have a co-worker (25 M) who has been a bit more touchy with me lately. For some context he has a GF(8 years) and we work in the restaurant industry. Most are my coworkers are female and are around the same age.

Situation.
He has been touching my shoulders from behind often, and my arms. He hasnâ€™t acted like this before and he doesnâ€™t do it to my other coworkers.  He does it whenever my guards are down and I simply donâ€™t like it. I donâ€™t care why he does it, I just want it  to stop.
The problem is that Iâ€™m afraid of being called out as sensitive or paranoid. 

I donâ€™t really like being touched by people in general but in the past Iâ€™ve always been called sensitive or something worse whenever I set my boundaries... so I would really like some advice for how to prevent something like that to happen again. 

Hope someone knows how to deal with touchy people cause I donâ€™t


Update: 
I forgot to say that he is my manager, but he is in general a nice guy so Iâ€™ll take the advice of being straight with him and stop worrying so much about how people view me when I set boundaries. 
Thank you all for the advice. I feel more confident now ðŸŒ»
