Internal job offer with a low ball pay
Recently applied for an internal role that would bump me from level 2 to level 4 (kinda promotion) but I knew going in that they would low ball me. I was told it’s 70k which was low since I’m only making 6k less right now but I thought I can negotiate at the end if they like me and opportunities I will get etc. after wasting month and a half with 7/8 different interviews I got an offer that’s 68k and 4k more than what I’m making now plus hiring manager said there’s no room for negotiating and this is the best offer he got even tho he understands that hr is being cheap. I’m with the company for 6 years and with the current role for more than 3yrs and I’m over qualified for my current role and for the promotion role that I applied for but hr has the audacity to low call me. If they hire from outside it’s 75k+ but hr is saying since most analysts are in the range that they offer they can’t offer more which is a bullshit reason. I will definitely reject the offer and start actively looking. But am I being stupid for rejecting this low ball offer ? Will I regret ? I really want to reject to take a stance against this bullshit
Thanks I wanted to get this out of my system
