In my 30s what should i be learning/looking into for my 40s?
For example, looking at financial gain, In my 20s i look back and think, in my 10s i should have saved my trading cards like pokemon, basketball, etc. to sell as some of the cards i had went up in value like crazy. In my 30s now i look back and think i should have saved more and/or invested more into stocks, real estate, etc. 

In my 40s I'm assuming ill look back into my 30s and go i should have done THIS. Some of you have lived ahead of me, help me "travel into the future" and discover what the THIS would be. What were some of the THIS's in your life?

FYI financial gain is just one example, I'm also interested in other matters such as choosing a career, health (physical &amp; mental), relationship, sex, food, etc.
