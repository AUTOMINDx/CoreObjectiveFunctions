Decided to pursue my dream of being of Voice Actor today. I bought my first microphone.
I've always been passive, i never took action to pursue things i wanted. Today that changed, i was in WalMart looking for gifts for the family, then i saw the mic. I bought it. A 50 dollar mic, nothing too extravagent but i think it'll do.

I've had dreams and aspirations of being a VA for a long time. But i never actually did anything. I have social anxiety and a fear of rejection so any advice on getting over that would be helpful.

Also any ideas on how to get started. I mostly have done practice readings of movie monologues and am working on maybe an anime fan dub.
