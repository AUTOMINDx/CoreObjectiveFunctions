Today I got my vaccine!
I was scared to get my vaccine because I was raised anti-vaxx and I also have had a very big fear of getting blood drawn and injections. Usually I have a full blown panics attack, but today I didn’t even cry. I did my own research on the vaccine and why people are anti-vaxx in the first place and it made me want to get the vaccine. I only shook and hyperventilated a little getting my vaccine and it didn’t even hurt, I was so surprised and I’m relieved I did this! I have a hard time stepping out of my comfort zone and yet I did that. I’m really proud of myself.

Edit: Thank you all so much for all the comments and awards! Most people are being so nice and there’s too many comments for me to reply to each and every one but I did upvote all the nice ones LOL! Thank you to whoever gave me premium/the coins!

Edit 2: If you are anti-vaxx or otherwise don’t want to get the vaccine, that’s fine. I don’t think anyone should be forced to get it, but I do think people should be properly educated on both sides and what they both think and then come to their own conclusions. That’s what I did. Please stop commenting about how you don’t believe in the vaccine, this wasn’t a post debating on whether or not the vaccine is good for you, etc, this is a post where I’m proud of myself for doing something that scared the shit out of me but I finally got over my fear and trauma and did what I felt was right after coming to my own conclusions instead of blindly following people. I will admit I blindly followed my family who is anti-vaxx and didn’t do proper research or make a choice that felt solid and good to me for years, until now. You can have whatever opinion you’d like but please stop being so defensive on my post that has nothing to do with you.
