Eating boring food for the rest of my life? Can we eat any good food sometimes?
I have acid reflux and TMJ, so I basically have to eat bland, soft food.  I miss eating the old food, but it's hard when I go out with my family.  My husband can eat anything. Sometimes he accidentally order food that I'm not supposed to eat.

On Saturday, we went to Mexican restaurant and I ate tamales and enchiladas.  The was a red sauce on top of the food. It's tomato sauce, I believe. It's not spicy. I definitely regret afterward. I could feel my chest get warmer (acid reflux) and my armpit has this discomfort that comes from eating something my body disapproves.

People like me with acid reflux and TMJ..are we going to eat low acidic food and soft food for the rest of our lives? I guess I don't mind, but I do miss the good food sometimes. Anyone find any balance that won't cause any problem?
