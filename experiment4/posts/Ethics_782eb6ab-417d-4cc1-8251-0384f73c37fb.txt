Is it unethical for a leader of the country where their country has a major own issues to reject immigrants?
This is referring to the case of immigrants who are coming in hordes of thousands to USA (from South America), Europe, (immigrants would like to get into Germany) and England. In these countries, they have their own problems. In USA, there is poverty among the blacks in the ghettoes, and the white or caucasians in the rural areas are not gainfully employed. This is one of the reasons why there is unrest anti-black, anti-Asian, anti-colored.

In Germany, burglars became frequent, sexual harrassment became frequent, housing problems and unemployment are aplenty too. The same is true in England. Plus pandemic problem - economy is down, no jobs, no employment, loss of income.

If the leader rejects the immigrants, is it an unethical act?
