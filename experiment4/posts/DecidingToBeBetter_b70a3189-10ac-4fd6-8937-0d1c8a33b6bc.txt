I just want to be alone
When I’m single I feel really happy and fulfilled in my life… sometimes I’ll meet someone I like and push myself to give it a try, and I end up being a terrible person to date. I don’t think I’m a selfish person, but in a relationship I know I can be.

I think I’m learning that I’d really just like to be single. I’d be okay never being in a long term relationship again. But society has this expectation that romantic love is true happiness and it’s sometimes difficult not to get wrapped up in that. When I say I want to be alone people immediately assume it’s either due to trauma I need to work through, or that I haven’t met the right person. It’s unfathomable that I just might want to be alone.

I’ve believed that for a long time too but I just know I’m happiest when I’m single. I don’t feel like myself when I’m in a relationship. I wish people would just believe and support me that this is what I WANT but the expectation of coupling up is so strong. 

Anyways, I’m making the choice to ignore those expectations finally and to just be in my own and not try to convince myself I want otherwise. And I feel lighter than I have in years. Maybe I’ll change my mind someday, but I don’t have to do what others expect of me.
