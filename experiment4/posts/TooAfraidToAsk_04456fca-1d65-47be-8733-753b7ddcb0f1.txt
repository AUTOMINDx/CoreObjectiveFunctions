Do people really view Christians so poorly? And why?
This is something I am kinda only realizing now. I guess I ignored it and don't tell people I am christian, but I, a roman catholic always try to be as good a person as I can be. I try to be nice to everyone else and I try to make sure everyone else is happy. And I can say the same for the other few Christian friends I have. So why do people seem to hate the concept of Christianity and Christians so much? Genuine question out of curiosity I don't want to stir the pot with this or anything.

Please don't attack anyone!
