Can someone recommend an introduction to Chinese Philosophy?
Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask!

I bought my partner a copy of Ames’s translation of Sun Tzu’s Art of Warfare for Christmas. She loves it but wants some initial wider reading on the background of philosophy in China.

Not necessarily a book specifically about warfare, but rather the general history of Chinese philosophy. We only studied “western” philosophy in school which obviously comes from very different principles, so it would really help finding a decent introduction to learn from the basics.
