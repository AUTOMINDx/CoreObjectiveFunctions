Too much “supply”?
I know this may sound odd, and perhaps this is a separate issue from my disorder, but I’ll ask anyways.

When my ego gets boosted, I mean really really boosted in a short period of time (IE: Ex asks me back, I win a tournament, I get asked to give a speech and get applause) do you ever feel so overcome with energetic excitement and elation that you’re unable to focus on other tasks. 

It’s as if it throws me into pure grandiosity to the point where it feels like mania. I’m unable to stay still and I become an entirely different person. Obviously this is rare, and dissipates, but can anyone relate?
