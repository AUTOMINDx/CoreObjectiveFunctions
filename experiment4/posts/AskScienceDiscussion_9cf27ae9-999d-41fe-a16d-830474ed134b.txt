When it comes to Quantum Mechanics, what are some misconceptions you wish were better understood?
Hello, I am a layperson who recently discovered the field of QM 2 years ago. 

I come from communities and studies centered around religion, history, and recently philosophy and I now come across many attempts to reason existence in the realm of philosophical and religious arguments. 

In regards to the famous quote, * "If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics."*, what are some common misconceptions about QM ideas/discoveries that you wish were better understood by the public and those who may be misappropriating it.
