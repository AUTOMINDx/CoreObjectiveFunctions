How do you envision a future and think about which path you should take without overthinking?
Recently I’ve stressed myself out so much with facts and so many negatives/positives about each career that I realize I’ve lost my motivation for anything. I can’t bring myself to enjoy studying again and I can’t even think  about what I want to do in the future. Not even a single clue. I can barely imagine myself doing anything in the future bc my mind feels so cluttered with job information. It’s like the general idea I had about what I wanted to do, is now blurry. i can’t find motivation in even thinking about pursuing certain careers. I barely remember which things I was passionate about and why I wanted to pursue certain careers in the first place since I know all the negatives about every job. Should I just take a break from this sort of research? How can I decide when I’m driving myself to insanity from the pressure?
