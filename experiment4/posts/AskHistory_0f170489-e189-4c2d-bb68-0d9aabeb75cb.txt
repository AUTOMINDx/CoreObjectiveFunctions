Have U.S. Social Conservatives ever been on the “right” side of history?
We hear this phrase all the time where, for example, those who fought against the Civil Rights movement were on the “wrong side of history.” 

This obviously refers to a vague collective decision as social norms and perspectives change over time. 

But has there ever been a time when the Social Conservative position, decades later, was viewed as the “right side” of history?

I think of the Sexual Revolution, the War on Drugs, the Cold War, Prohibition, Roe v Wade, the Civil War, Harvey Milk, Vietnam War, Civil Rights, Segregation and so on. 

Are there any examples where the conservative stance is idealized in retrospect?

(Note: I’m not asking about Republicans vs Democrats - just Social Conservatism)
