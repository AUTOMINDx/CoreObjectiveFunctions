It is incredibile how the "wrong" therapy method could twist your whole vision of things.
I'm not saying there are universally wrong or right therapy approaches, I am just reflecting on how drastic can be the change in the way you see and live things depending on how you get to analyse them.

Today I had the second session with my 3rd therapist.My first one was great. But I had to move from the city where she operates and find a second therapist and well.. His method was too much for me. He's still using a very classic Freudian method so he made me analyse every single aspect of the relationship with my father which ok, it made me aware of "stuff" but also made me feel like I "must" have insecurities and fear because my biological father wasn't the one who raised me.  Like I cannot be a fully confident person with a past like that.I felt all over the place, my self esteem got destroyed for a bit thinking about stuff that I never personally felt the need to think about.

Also he would end the session in a very short time. Let's say I get to a point that he considered important for me.. he would tell me to stop, repeat what I just said and then telling me that the session ended there. The shortest I've been there was 8 minutes and the longest was 45. Obviously still paying the same sum of money in any case.

Third therapist kicked in and wao. Two sessions and I am already feeling waaay better. There's no need to analyse things so deeply, detaching from reality in such a hard way.

I explained my whole point and T was like: *Why are you talking about your father? Is he here? Do you need him?*

Well, no I actually fucking don't
