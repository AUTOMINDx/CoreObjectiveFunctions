After 2 years of unemployment, finally got a job!
I finished my master's in 2019, and before finishing my qualification exams covid struck, took me over a year just to take the exams, then spent the last 2 years applying and being rejected. 

Had a terrible 2021, lost my father to covid, but finally had these good news for christmas and just wanted to share with everyone.

If anyone else is struggling, keep your head up and don't give up, sooner or later an opportunity will come.

**Merry Christmas!**
