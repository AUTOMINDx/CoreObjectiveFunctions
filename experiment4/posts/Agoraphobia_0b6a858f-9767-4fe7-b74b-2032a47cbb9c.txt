Does anybody else really struggle on airplanes?
I think I have agoraphobia. I basically get anxiety in situations where I would feel "trapped" if I had a panic attack: inside an MRI chamber, on a stage where it would be awkward if I had to walk off mid presentation, and especially: on airplanes. 

I love aviation, I frequently play Flight Simulator. I am not scared of the concept of flying, I know it is incredibly safe. I am however, terrified of having a severe panic attack on an airplane and being trapped in an uncomfortable tube with strangers for hours. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. I feel silly because I love airplanes but I hate commercial flight.

Anybody relate?
