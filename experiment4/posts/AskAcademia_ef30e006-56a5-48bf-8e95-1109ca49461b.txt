When should you email a prof again if you get no response?
Hello everyone, 

I'm not sure if this the right sub, if not then I am sorry 

I emailed a prof who had a very vague description for an interesting PhD Position on her website (Europe).
I emailed her a short summary about me, my CV and why it's interesting to me and if she could send me more information if the project is stj available. 

So far I got no answer (emailed 11 days ago)

I am not sure if I should simply take silence as a rejection or if I should follow up? Maybe someone can share his*her experiences or opinion?
Thanks!
