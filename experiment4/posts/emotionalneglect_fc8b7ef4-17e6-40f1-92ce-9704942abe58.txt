DAE feel like they are just an observer of life with no agency?
I feel like I can not make anything happen, just accept things as they happen. I have no strength to push against the world and create change. It feels like I have to put up with everything and can't say no. On the inside, there is a volcano of rage beyond my comprehension, on the outside, there is a friendly fake smile. I can't get what's inside of me out so the only thing I can do is direct it at myself. It feels like there is a giant boulder strapped to my back and I can't put it down, I have to carry it. I feel like if I were to put it down and follow my own path, I would be all alone. Well, I guess I already am so there is nothing to lose but that extreme fear is still crippling.
