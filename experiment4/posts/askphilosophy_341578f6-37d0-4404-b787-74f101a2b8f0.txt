Is pursuing an academic career in Philosophy still possible?
I'm just about to start my undergraduate studies in philosophy. I've been a passionate reader/writer of philosophy, and have always had the dream of becoming a scholar. 

The majority of people I've talked to claim it's impossible; and most of my teachers, on top of my parents, have been trying really hard to convince me to go for a math-related STEM field, mostly due to my competing in math competitions from a young age. 

The question I have is targeted towards those who've made it in this field. I'm confident insofar as dedicating my self to the study and working hard for succeeding; but, even with utmost devotion, is it even possible to make it in philosophy? And what is the road to said success.

I hope this sub is fit for this question.
