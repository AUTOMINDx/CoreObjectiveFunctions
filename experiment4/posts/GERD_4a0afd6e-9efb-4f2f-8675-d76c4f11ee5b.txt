Finally got answers
Today I got a phone call from my gastrointerologist, and it made me cry.
I FINALLY had an answer for why I've been suffering so long with this. 
For 6 years I've been going through a living hell of non stop acid/reflux, regurgitation, pain, bloating, gas (basically any symptom)  and I've been living off of a cocktail of medications. I've also had so many tests and studies done,  I was thinking "they're never going to figure it out" . Until today, when I got the call.  Turns out, I have Gastroparesis! It's a rare condition that affects the stomach muscles and prevents proper stomach emptying. Gastroparesis can affect digestion. The cause might be damage to a nerve that controls stomach muscles.

And while it isn't curable, it's treatable.

 I'll start medication this week to help. I honestly feel so fucking relieved to have an answer and to be able to take steps forward to having a better life. I just want to move forward and feel better. 

The big point I'd like to say though, is don't give up.  Keep trying.  Even if you feel super discouraged.  Even if you've had shitty care or doctors. Advocate for yourself and get the care you need.  Keep chipping away until you get the  care/answers you need. It's so important and will lift a huge weight off of your chest.  

I hope everyone in this sub is able to get the help and answers they need.

If you took the time to read this, thank you. ‚ù§
