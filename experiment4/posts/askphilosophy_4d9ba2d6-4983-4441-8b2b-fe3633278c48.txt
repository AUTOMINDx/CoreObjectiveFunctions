A Spinozist Reading of Don Quixote?
Would it be possible to view Don Quixote's supposed enchanting as a highly explicit portrayal of Confused Knowledge?

He interacts with various objects, which, to him, seem and appear differently than to others. His senses seem, to me, to be _tricked_ by the objects he interacts with in such a way that their essence is not only impenetrable, but utterly confused - he could not possibly have adequate knowledge about the conatus of the objects he interacts with due to his sensing and perceiving them being totally skewed.

For example:

• Don Quixote's interaction with the windmills -  he envisions them as giants; he retains certain pieces of knowledge and sense perception that are similar between the two: they are large, they move slowly, etc. His knowledge of windmills-as-giants is not totally fractured, since he associates them in many ways, yet his mind contains an inadequate idea of the nature of windmills-as-giants since they are windmills, not giants - as they seem to him.

• The Helmet of Mambrino - DQ believes the barber's basin to be The Helmet of Mambrino. Again, the image of the basin-as-helmet in his mind is skewed, but not totally and completely broken; basins and helmets share one core feature: their opening/hole/etc. 

• Dulcinea of Toboso - he meets a peasant girl who he has been told is Dulcinea, and he becomes incredibly confused and melancholic; this one is slightly more obscure because he is being outright lied to.

• etc.

Now, approaching these mistakes from the perspective of Spinoza's _Imagination_ and how images of objects are necessarily a form of inadequate, confused, mutilated knowledge, could we view DQ's sensory mistakes as a highly explicit form of misunderstanding the essences of objects? The Conatus of the elements which compose, say, a windmill, are so vividly different from the Conatus of a giant.

This is opposed by Sancho's general ability to view windmills as windmills, helmets as helmets, basins as basins, etc. Sancho provides us with a glimpse into Spinoza's _Reason_, since he will perceive a windmill and view it as such, and from that perception he can use his ability of reason to deduce that the windmill is, in fact, a windmill - he can utilise his power of reason in such a way that he does not let his imagination become totally confused.

For Don Quixote, the idea which transcends all others is the idea of Knight Errantry - where Spinoza would claim that terms like _Being_, _Something_, etc. are utterly confused due to their containing of all objects, the transcendental idea for DQ is _Knight Errantry_, which, for him, confuses all knowledge he gains via his senses.

I am not sure if this made sense, and I didn't want it to be too long, so I've obviously left out key parts of my understanding of Spinoza's Imagination and Reasoning, but I hope this is somewhat understandable and comprehensible.

Thanks :)
