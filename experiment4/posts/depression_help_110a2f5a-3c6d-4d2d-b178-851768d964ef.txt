Antidepressants vs therapist
I’m not sure if this is the right place to post. I just got diagnosed with MDD during my annual physical. Apparently I met the criteria having 7-8 of the symptoms for over 2 yrs. with the criteria being 4 symptoms for at least 4 mo. 

Some more problematic symptoms include a general lack of interest in things (even things I should), not feeling like doing anything or going out, feeling distracted or preoccupied all the time, and really terrible memory since I’m never really in the moment I guess. And an increasingly low opinion of my self worth. I’m finding I need to ask people to repeat themselves all the time. To put it in context, this is really different than who i was before. 

I’m not shocked. I’ve felt like something had been off for a while. I don’t think it’s super severe but I’m just not enjoying life (the big things or the little) as much as I believe I should. 

I can’t put my finger on anything that’s acutely “wrong”. I have a great and stable, although stressful job, a beautiful wife, and 2 beautiful healthy kids. But I’m finding myself to need to keep reminding myself I should be happy and thankful relative to all the insane hardships that everyone else is going through. But I just feel like I’m in a funk. 

My primary care doc prescribed me antidepressants. I was always under the impression that antidepressants aren’t something prescribed all the time and only by specialized mental health physicians- therapists or psychologists. 

Is this too quick of a jump? Should I talk to a therapist first? Sorry for the long rant, I don’t know of any friends or peers that are going through this.
