Feminism vs Radical Feminism?
Hi so I didn't really know where else to post this. Even though I'm part of multiple female-centric subreddits like r/TwoXChromosomes etc I am too afraid to ask this on other platforms due to fear of being banned etc. If this is in any way harmful, please delete this post. 

What distinguishes one from a feminist to a radical feminist? What are the issues of contention bw the two? Where do TERF/SWERF fall in this spectrum (for lack of a better word) of feminist thought?
