I did it. I moved out and went NC
Today is my 18th birthday and I am currently laying in my new bed. I am feeling so many mixed emotions, but it’s peaceful here. It’s quiet. I changed my number and I haven’t been as anxious, but of course I’m still getting a little anxious because I didn’t tell anyone I left. I just left a note explained why and moved into my new place. Any advice? Words of encouragement?

UPDATE: It’s the morning after and I am so overwhelmed with joy reading all of your comments. I have never received this much love on my birthday and it is truly the greatest gift!! I called the non-emergency police line and they ended up telling me my mom did try &amp; call the police &amp; report me missing but I told them I’m safe and now I don’t have to worry about that. I feel so overwhelmed with peace it’s amazing!!!! Thank you all so much for giving me the courage to do this at such a young age!!!
