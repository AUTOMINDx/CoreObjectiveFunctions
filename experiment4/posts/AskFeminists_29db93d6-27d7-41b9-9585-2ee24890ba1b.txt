Female Hygiene Products and Sales Tax
I’ve been told for years by feminists that Tampons and pads aren’t tax exempt for health reasons, but condoms are. I of course disagree with this, I think there should absolutely not be a tax on any of those products, &amp; I support universal healthcare so I think Hygiene products &amp; contraceptives should be provided for everyone. 

What I’m confused about is, yesterday I purchased some pads and tampons for my gf, and they were both tax exempt. So now I’m wondering, is this a state issue? I live in PA, and we’re not exactly the most progressive state, but we’re also not the worst. Is it something that’s changed recently? Did I misinterpreted what feminists meant, and were they just calling these products an effective tax on women?
