Is there a name for this specific phenomenon? Authors talking about it? Is it something really dated that I am just now realising? Am I completely out of my mind?
So

Recently I've noticed that the internet has a great ability to appropriate facts, jokes, music, cultural factors - basically anything - and turn them into trends, new jokes, memes, completely alien to the original material, which ends up getting lost in the process, to the point of becoming virtually unreachable.

From this "phenomenon" that I've been observing more and more (Tik Tok played an important role in amplifying this process), a large number of users don't even know where the material they now reproduce comes from, often believing it to be something completely different.

A practical example: for his latest special, Bo Burnham wrote a song about the persuasive power of the internet and, at one point, gives an evil laugh. A short time later, that same laugh was extracted and used in a Tik Tok trend, absolutely out of context, to the point that most people do not know where that track came from.

I know that the process of vulgarizing, depersonalizing, misrepresenting, popularizing and commercializing something is nothing new - this was one of the central themes of Warhol's work - but I would like to know if this phenomenon (especially aggravated by the internet) has a name. If there are authors discussing this, especially about the role of the internet in accelerating this process of disappearance of an objective truth due to the new appropriations that virtual trends capture and re-signify. Or if I'm going crazy and talking about a topic that everyone is tired of discussing.

Thanks in advance.
