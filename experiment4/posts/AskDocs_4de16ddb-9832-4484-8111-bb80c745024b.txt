I need your honest opinion on the COVID vaccine
I have alopecia and mild acne. This year out of my doctor's advice I took finasteride and minocycline.

Although  the doctor said that I shouldn't worry about side effects as they are  rare, I got a mild ED from finasteride that recovered a few weeks after  stopping treatment. Minocycline on its part gave me gases and a bad  stomache every day until I decided to stop taking it (I had to take it  for three months and stopped after one month and half, never completed  treatment as indicated).

I'm 22, male, supposedly I have no comorbidities, I almost never drink alcohol  (twice a year approx), don't smoke, eat whole grain, tons of fiber, fish, meat, don't add sugar nor salt, etc.

The thing is, I told her about how many reports on side effects about the  vaccine I heard on the internet and she said that I shouldn't worry and I  should take it.

I'm taking it  next month but I feel very uneasy as she tried to reassure me with other  medications before but I ended up suffering side effects.

My question is, and I need you to be totally upfront:

Have you seen in patients side effects that you link to the vaccine? How often?

Official  information gives the idea that it is very rare but then you look on  the internet and people claim side and adverse effects left and right.

I need to know the truth
