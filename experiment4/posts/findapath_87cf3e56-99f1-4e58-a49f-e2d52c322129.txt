27/f looking for a job in tech with no tech experience- help
Iâ€˜be been working at my current company for 4 years- I get your typical raise of 3% every year, but have never gotten promoted- even though I have brought this up multiple times and have asked for a game plan-we are a small marketing department so no set growth track. 
I want to find a job that allows me luxury to live my life, mainly getting paid more than the 45k I am currently but also have a decent work/life balance- no calls on the weekends. 
My role is a marketing specialist and I work with 60+ clients now. I say I am a jack of all trades master of none, because I deal with everything in marketing. 
I want to break into tech because I just feel the growth would be much better and could transition into other areas a bit better. I would love to do edtech, but again not sure where to start. 
I love to plan, analyze, and give viable recommendations. I also like to create learning tracks and deal with more the internal side that client facing. 
Any advice on direction or steps I could take to break into tech or just a better industry?
