I showered.. TWO DAYS IN A ROW!!
(idk if this is the right flare, I'm sorry)

I was visiting my partner for the weekend and we had a great time! 

I have had depression since I was 8 years old (am now in my late teens) and it has been very bad the past half year.. showering and general hygiene is very difficult and I shower about once a week when I get too embarrassed to go out because of greasy hair..

This weekend I managed to shower both Saturday and Sunday which hasn't happened for at least three years! 

I know it's not much and as soon as I'm home, I'll go back to showering once a week, but.. it's the small victories and I'm really proud of this one!
