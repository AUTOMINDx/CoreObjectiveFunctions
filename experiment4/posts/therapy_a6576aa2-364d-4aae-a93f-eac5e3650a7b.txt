Today’s therapy session. I sat there thinking “wow, my therapist is such a d\*ck.”

She was talking about people who’ve experienced extreme childhood abuse are “choosing negativity” and “don’t realise that the only person who has ever held them back is them, not anyone else.’

Then she added: “Everything happens for us not to us.”

I asked her how “everything happens for us” applies to toddlers who are raped \[this happened to both me and my cousin, who eventually committed suicide.\]. Her response was, “it’s easier to blame others than to take back control of our lives. Everything happens for a reason.”

I asked her if murder, genocide and rape “happens for a reason.” She seemed slightly nervous and said, “oh no well those things are really bad I guess.”

This is licensed therapist who claims she specialises in complex trauma
