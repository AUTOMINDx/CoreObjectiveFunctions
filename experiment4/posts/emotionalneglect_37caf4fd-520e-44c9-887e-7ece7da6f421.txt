I feel really bad saying this but my MIL bought me Xmas presents that have nothing to do with what I said I needed.
I never, ever expect gifts ever, but I know my partner's family will never be okay with that so I told them a couple of home appliances I needed. My MIL wouldn't accept that they're gift worthy and decided to get me other kitchen appliances that she deemed more of a gift. Non of which I need or have space for in my home. I feel bad saying all this but it's triggering me because it's reminding me of my own mother not paying attention at all to what I actually want or need.
