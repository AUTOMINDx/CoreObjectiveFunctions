Marriage material?
What do men see as marriage material? I (29, F) keep walking into a wall with guys who seem to just want sex from me. Like, everyone. Even if I make it clear from the start that I want to build something, or just be friends. They always end up wanting to sleep with me. But they don't want more than that. I'm financially independent, I'm smart, I think I'm pretty damn funny and I have a lot of life experience. There's so much more to me. But I think I'm giving off the wrong vibe somehow?

Edit: Imagine two women in a bar; one you want to have sex with, and the other you want to have a conversation with. I'm the first woman. What does the second woman have that interests you and makes you want to get to know her better? 

Edit 2: I think the major thing that has hit home for me, is that men like to feel "needed". I forgot about this Lo. I really struggle with depending on other people. I prefer to take the caretaker role but in a relationships this eventually bums me out cause I also want to be taken care of. So I'm going to work on not coming across as if I don't need anything/anyone. This really blew up, thanks for the advice!!
