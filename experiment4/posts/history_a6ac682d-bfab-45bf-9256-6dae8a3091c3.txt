History books/articles that read kind of like stories
I've recently gotten interested in learning about history, however most of the sites I find are written in a very textbook-like way, and I personally don't find them very engaging.

As a child I used to love Horrible Histories, so something in that type of style but for adults would be great. In general though, I'm just looking for books and/or articles that are engaging and targeted towards people with no academic experience with history. I'm really interested in Ancient Rome and Greece, but recommendations for anything history related would be appreciated. Thanks :)
