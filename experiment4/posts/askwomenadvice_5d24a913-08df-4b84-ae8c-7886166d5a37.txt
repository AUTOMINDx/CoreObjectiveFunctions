Do any of you wear pantyhose and can you help me (29F) figure out what I am doing wrong?
This seems like such a silly problem, but I need to wear pantyhose for professional situations. And every time I wear it, no matter what size I buy, the waistband is tight and like cuts in (not painfully, just you see a line in my clothes and I occasionally tug at it) and then my lower stomach gets a weird shape like it bulges out more than it does without? Instead of a normal stomach shape, I look like a lowercase “b” from the side view. 


For reference, I am 5’4” and 150lbs. I typically buy the size Q pantyhose thinking that maybe bigger will cut into my stomach less. But then there is no controlling in the control top so like I still get the stomach bulge. Do I size down? Do I size up? I see women who wear pantyhose and look like normal humans from the side so I know this is possible! Please tell me your secrets, women of Reddit. 


TLDR: I have no idea how to size myself for pantyhose and am trying to find a way to wear them for professional settings.
