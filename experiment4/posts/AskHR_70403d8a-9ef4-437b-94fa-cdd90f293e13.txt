[NY] my boss got everyone a gift except me because I'm Jewish
My team just had our last meeting of the year. We went through some business stuff, then for the last half my dept head ordered pizza and we hung out eating lunch. 

While we're all sitting around and eating, she starts handing out gifts to everyone except me (reeeeally awkward). One of my team mates noticed and called it out and dept head says like it's totally obvious, "yeah, these are for Christmas and OP is Jewish".

I know I'm not entitled to presents from my boss or anything, but this just made me so uncomfortable since she literally singled me out like this. It's not even like they were ornaments or anything Christmas themed - she got everyone $100 Amazon gift cards, which even a jew like me would enjoy. 

Part of me thinks that I should say something to someone, but I don't want to make a big deal about nothing you know? 

I'm from NYC and have never directly experienced antisemitism, so I'm not even really sure if that's what's happening. So is this (excuse the pun) kosher? Do I do something or just let it go?

Edit: I'm still having trouble shaking the awkward, but a few people have actually offered me half of their giftcard (I love my team), so I get the feeling I might not be the only thinking that this was messed up. Thanks everyone for the help
