Gaviscon Advance "chewable" tablets - why didn't anyone warn me?
Since everyone around here seems to rave about Gaviscon Advance (from the UK) for LPR, I finally decided to order some from Amazon. I went for chewable tablets over liquid, just because it's my preference.

 I just got them today, and took one after dinner. I was expecting "chewable" to be like Tums type chewable... I was *not* expecting this horrible, gluey, stick-to-your-teeth consistency. I went to Amazon reviews right away and founds loads of other people mentioning this, so I realized this was in fact how they are , and not that I got a bad batch or something.

I can tolerate it, especially if it works, but blech... they're pretty horrible. :(

Anyway, just a minor rant, hehe.
