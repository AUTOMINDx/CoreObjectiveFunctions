Is it unethical to use steroids if you’re not using it for any sports or competition?
Body dysmorphia has gone up these recent years. And a lot of people are using steroids to improve their shape. 

Not a lot of people are aware just how many are using steroids and it’s not just the very big guys, but these people are not necessarily using it to win a body building competition or other sports but just for the looks. They might post their body pictures on social media and walk shirtless around on beaches. 

Knowing that people are struggling with body image and are working out a lot and don’t know how many are using steroids, is it then unethical to use it?

Is it unethical to lie about using it given the stigma (or illegality) that is associated with it? Does it matter how much you are putting yourself out there to be seen in terms of ethics?

I’m not talking about the potential health impacts toll on the health care system, but just purely from a perspective of body expectations. You could say the same about the kind of cosmetic surgery that improve your looks or make you look younger than the rest.
