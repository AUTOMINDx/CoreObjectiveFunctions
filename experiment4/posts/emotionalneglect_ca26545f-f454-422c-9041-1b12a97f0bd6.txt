I developed an automatic habit of saying certain sentences to myself. It's become like a coping mechanism.
Trigger warning/suicide ideation




I noticed I say these at least once a day. I am not suicidal and I wouldn't end my life or want someone else to, but these phrases have become a sort of coping mechanism. 

Trigger warning...................... 





I'd say to myself that I want to kill myself/shoot myself in the face, or to have someone shoot me multiple times and that I'd thank them for it. But I wouldn't really want this to happen in real life. 

I wouldn't express them to someone else, just to myself when I know no one is listening. 

Does anyone say things like this to themself? 

I don't want to use these anymore. I want to change this automatic habit that I developed.
