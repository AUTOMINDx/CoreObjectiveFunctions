Offers don't provide time over 40?
Is this typical? I have 2 offers that don't include time over 40, they're for more money than I'm making now but I'm wearing of anyone who's not giving me time over 40 I sometimes would do 60-100 weeks at my second job, luckily they did time over 40.

Is this a standard practice?

EDIT: do there's been a couple comments mentioning OT. I'd like the keep the conversation to straight time. OT can have time and a half connotations and that's not what I'm talking about.

EDIT 2:

I had directly proposed this be included in my contract and they were not interested in addressing these terms. 

1) straight time over 45 hours
2) seniority level of 4
3) 2.5 days in/out hybrid.
