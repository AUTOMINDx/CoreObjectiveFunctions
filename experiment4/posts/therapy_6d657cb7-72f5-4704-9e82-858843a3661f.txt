Relationship Therapy - Can’t speak to the opposite sex
My girlfriend (30f) breaks down when ever I (31m) speak to another woman despite me not having any interest romantically or sexually with them. I am a social person, always have been and building friendships and rapport has always served me well. I am currently setting up a property company for me and my partner but she makes it so difficult when she breaks down and demands I do not speak to other women. What shall I do??? I have tried consoling her and reassuring her but it doesn’t work. She often compares me to her friends and says things like “well non of my friends boyfriends ever feel the need to talk to other women, why do you?”
