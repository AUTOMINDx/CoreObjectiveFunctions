Am I being taken advantage of?
I was promoted in my company about 4 months ago, from an entry level position to a management position. This was exciting because I am pretty young, and it was a big step. I was offered $3000 less annually than the person who was in the position before me, but they chalked it up to experience (although I have a college degree and he didn’t, and we are similar ages and similar years in the workforce, but he did have more directly related experience). I tried to negotiate but they didn’t budge, and the offer was still more than I was previously making. 

Since then, I have basically been asked to create policies for most parts of my job, since they are severely lacking, even though my company has been around over 10 years. I wasn’t aware I would be building policies from the ground up with no support from management other than reviewing what I create. Is this a normal expectation for someone making less than 45k? I’m afraid I’m being taken advantage of because of my age. This is also on top of my daily responsibilities that have me working pretty much 9 straight hours everyday. Any advice would be very much appreciated :)
