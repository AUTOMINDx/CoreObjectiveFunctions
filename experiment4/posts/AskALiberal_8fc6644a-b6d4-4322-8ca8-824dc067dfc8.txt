What do you think conservatives want?
What’s their end goal for American society? What does it look like for for groups like the LGBTQ community, Muslims, and immigrants? Is it a democracy?

Edit: I didn’t ask this in ask conservatives (aside from ye ole banhammer) cause I’ve noticed that conservatives very rarely answer this question and instead take the time to just disagree with whatever answer a left winger gives. 

And if liberals think conservatives don’t want equality and instead just want to rule over them, then what’s with all the rhetoric about bipartisanship, unity, and compromise?
