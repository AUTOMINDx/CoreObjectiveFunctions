I feel like such a burden
I'm spiraling today. I started back at my old job since they emailed me to start working with them again, but I'm missing some equipment that I need. They wanted me to pick up the equipment from another employee's house that's about an hour away, so it'd be a total of like... 2 hours in the car, or more. I told them that I have a medication that I'm on that makes it unsafe to drive that long, which is true but I still somehow feel like I'm lying. They said it was fine, and that driving wasn't in the job description so I didn't need to apologize. I just started bawling after this. I wish I had a normal brain. I wish I could interact with the world normally. 

Another employee said that he has a cousin near my house that he's been meaning to see, so he'll bring the equipment to me. I feel like such a burden because of this. I feel like a terrible employee. I can't stop crying. I don't know why I can't just do normal things that other people can do. I just feel like an overall terrible person. I hate that people are having to change their schedule to do things for me. I'm such a burden. I've tried so hard to get better but I still can't do something normal like drive to pick something up.
