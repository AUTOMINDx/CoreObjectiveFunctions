DAE spend an absurd amount of time second-guessing everything you tell your therapist?
Just as the title states, I spend way too much time second-guessing and overanalyzing everything I bring up during my sessions, including how I word certain things, mostly out of fear of how it’ll affect the way my therapist perceives me. Other times, I worry that what I said wasn’t appropriate in hindsight or that my wording didn’t quite accurately capture or express my emotions and/or thoughts (i.e. unintentionally downplaying vs amplifying certain issues). 
I normally spend a couple days overanalyzing the session, and was wondering if this is a common issue other people experience.
