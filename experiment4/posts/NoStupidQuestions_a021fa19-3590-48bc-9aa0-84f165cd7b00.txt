Whatever happened to "wholesome" celebrities, like Bob Ross or Mr. Rogers?
It seems like there's no such thing as "wholesome" celebrities who speak for kindness and love. Every celeb I see these days are always "cancelled" for being racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, etc all those gross and heartbreaking things that shouldn't exist in the world. The only "wholesome" celeb I see left is Keanu Reeves. Like whatever happened to the sweet kind amazing celebrities who fought for love instead of hate and tell those that being kind and caring is the only way to go in life?

Where has all the "wholesome" famous people gone?

Sorry for sounding like a, as the Reddit community and every other mean person refer it to, "sensitive snowflake" in this. I'm generally confused and worried.

EDIT: omg I had no idea that this would blow up like this! Thank you all so much for the recommendations to all these wonderful celebs! I was feeling like utter crap writing this and now I feel much better. Y'all are amazing! Thank you for those who have given this some awards, y'all are much appreciated! \*blows kisses\* Have a great day/afternoon/evening/night to each and every one of you guys!
