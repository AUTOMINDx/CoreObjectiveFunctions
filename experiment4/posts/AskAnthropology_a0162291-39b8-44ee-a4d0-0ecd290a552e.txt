Were there any forms of land management practiced in Europe that helped encourage biodiversity like in the Americas and Australia?
I just finished reading books like Braiding Sweetgrass, 1491, The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines Made Australia, Dark Emu and Tending the Wild. All of which discussed how indigenous people in the Americas and Australia had traditional forms of land management (such as controlled burnings of grasslands along with specific rules on gathering and maintaining resources) that helped create landscapes and ecosystems that where biodiverse and able to sustain a diverse amount of fauna with relatively large populations. Currently it seems as if most of Europe is ecologically sterile. With its long history of agriculture, animal husbandry and urbanization, with a few pockets of biodiversity in the Carpathians and Scandinavia. Were there similar forms of land management practiced on the European continent at any point in its history and when did that begin to shift?
