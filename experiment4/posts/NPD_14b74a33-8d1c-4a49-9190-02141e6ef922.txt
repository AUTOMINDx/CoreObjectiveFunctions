Thoughts on Dr. Grande?
For those who don’t know him, he’s a licensed mental health counselor who posta videos on Youtube about a variety of subjects involving mental health (mental illness, personality disorders, etc). 

He has A LOT of videos about narcissism, i think i might have watched over 30 of them, and there’s still other ones coming up on my recommendations. 

Idk if anyone knows about him, but i’m sure those of us who have done at least a bit of research on NPD have literally come across him at some point. His videos were the first that came up when i started my research, along with Dr. Ramani’s (who i don’t like as much)
