Green laser shows red beam while passing through a prism.
I have a ~1000mW green laser that i tried shining through a prism by firing it ~perpendicular to the angled side so that it reflects internally off of the base.

What i noticed was that within the prism, the beam looks completely red. On exiting it's green as well.

Question being: why does the beam turn red inside the prism?

Update: same prism under a UV light and a white LED torch. I think the white LED torch is also showing a faint red beam inside the prism.

Update 2: no visible beam when i shone a red laser through it. 

I think the red laser observation adds some credibility to the fluorescence theory. Some impurities reacting to the green wavelengths.
