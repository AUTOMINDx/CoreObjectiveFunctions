Just got an endoscopy after 5 months ... I am so grateful for this community help.
The title might be confusing but there is not a victory yet. However, the endoscopy helped to confirm my condition, Gerd and peptic ulcers. This also relieved my fear of cancer. 

I have been suffering from choked feeling, fatigue, sore throat, feeling cold in the back for more than 4 months. Those first months were so bad since i was extremely stressed with the fear of cancer in my throat. As the doctor said stress worsen the condition. It was the advice and comments in this channel helping me to get over and be better. 

Now everything is clear, so i can focus on treating gerd with 100% concentration. 

Again very thankful for the community.
