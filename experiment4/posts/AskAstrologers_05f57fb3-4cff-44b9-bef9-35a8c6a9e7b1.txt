Psa this sub is called ASK ASTROLOGERS, not project about your crappy ex.
Earlier someone made a post with placements of her partner. Said placements were mostly Gemini, Aries, Scorpio and Taurus (IIRC).

An overwhelming majority of the comments were "omg sis RUN!!!!!" and "cheater!! Fuckboy!!! Will break your heart!!" And "omg my ex had several of these placements I wish I could warn every woman to stay away".

Your toxic ex does not speak for everyone in existence with said placement. No ACTUAL astrologer would ever say this. Does everyone with a Sag stellium like Ted Bundy turn out to be a serial killer? no! Same logic here! 

No placements are inherently cheaters or more loyal. My ex was a Cancer Venus, the steryotypically most loyal Venus sign, and was anything BUT loyal. An Aries Venus in the 12th house with a trine to Saturn will be a wildly different person than an Aries Venus in the 5th house square Uranus. Any ACTUAL astrologer would know this and would make a point of this. 

Generally speaking, those with their Venus (or other personal planets) in Aries/Gemini/Sagittarius aren't "non committal/cheaters". They simply don't want to be in a relationship that falls into a stale and boring routine after years together. And there is literally nothing wrong with that. Life is long, who the f wants to be with someone boring? I have none of the mentioned Venus signs, and being bored is a huge dealbreaker for me. 

Any placement can cheat and any placement can be loyal.

Again, this sub is called ASK ASTROLOGERS. Maybe some of you should create your own little pop astrology sub where you can project about your trash ex all day, and leave this sub for us actual astrologers. It's doing a huge disservice to the complexity and beauty of astrology. No wonder a good majority of the population views astrology as a joke. 

I can definitely tell transit Mercury is in Sagittarius ðŸ™„ðŸ¥³.
