Why isn't a telescope on the moon something that is being worked towards as much as let's say the JWST?
From what I know we aren't terribly far away technologically, from being able to make a moonbase. Yet there are all these plans for space telescopes going into the 2040s even (LUVOIR for instance).

When it comes to that timescale, taking into consideration the fact that by 2040, we might even be looking at a marsbase beginning to start, wouldn't settling on the moon be a desirable endeavor?

Making much more powerful telescopes compared to Hubble and JWST would probably become a lot easier, and I'm pretty sure a base there would have a lot of other advantages too (a place with solid infrastructure, from where it is also very easy to launch - maybe an intermediate step for Mars missions, idk, but sounds like it could be of use)

Why isn't this a thing that's being pushed for? Or is it, and are we just not getting it into the mainstream media?
