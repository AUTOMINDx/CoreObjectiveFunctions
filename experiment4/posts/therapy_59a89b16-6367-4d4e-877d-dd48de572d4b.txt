Hello people, how do i find a therapist
Hello everyone and merry christmas. I am a 16yr old kid. I think i really need to talk to someone and my friends won’t suffice. I can’t talk to my parents, they aren’t equipped to handle their own problems let alone mine. Furthermore, they see me as their perfect boy since i’m a top ranking scholar in school. My life is in shambles right now and I feel like a sociopath. Is there a way i can approach therapy without the drama or any advice. Thank you
