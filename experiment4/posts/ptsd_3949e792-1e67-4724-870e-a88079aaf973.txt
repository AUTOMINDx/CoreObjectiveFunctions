Had an episode after getting intimate with my gf tonight
Has anyone experienced this before? I feel like i’m going crazy.

Everything was great, and then I started getting intrusive thoughts about when i’ve been SA’d. I stopped everything. I sobbed to her. 

I’ve done this a few times now. It’s embarrassing and infuriating, but she is amazing and gave me water and asked if I wanted a snack. She made me feel so safe while she reminded me she was there.

I want to have a good time, not be reminded of shitty experiences every time I have sex. 
I’m so tired.
