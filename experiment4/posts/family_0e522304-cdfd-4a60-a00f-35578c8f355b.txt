I dont want to get my aunt a gift bc she disrespected me
Okay so, every Xmas my family draws names out of a hat and there's a $50 limit on what you can gift to the person whose name you pull. I got my aunts. My aunt is known for poking fun and teasing us but I feel like this is just straight up disrespect. I asked her what she wanted and she said a gift card to a bar she frequents. I messaged the bar on FB to see if they do giftcards since there's no other info about the bar online (very small town bar). My mom called me and told me that she knows for a fact that the bar doesn't do giftcards and my aunt knew that. So, she wanted to send me to this bar, which is about 1.5hr drive away from me, to try and get a giftcard she knew didn't exist. Am I crazy for feeling disrespected since she thought it was funny that I would put in the effort to drive there, waste my gas, and give her $50 for the bar when she KNEW that I wouldn't be able to get her gift there?
