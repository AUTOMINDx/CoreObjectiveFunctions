Is it "ok" to decide to accept being passively suicidal as a natural state of being and just work on other stuff?
Yes, I know ultimately each of us can only answer this for ourselves.

No, I can't elaborate on how to qualify "ok".

I think it's just a rhetorical question for the void, answer "yes" or "no" only if you want. Share whatever. Similar feelings, overcoming this etc.

EDIT: Thanks for sharing and keep it up everybody, this has been interesting! I did cause some confusion: in my experience, "passively suicidal" and "suicidal ideation" have meant slightly different things, the latter meaning more that even if not about to act you have specific plans and thoughts that you may want/deserve/need to do it, the former more along the lines of generalized thoughts that are just a part of your life now. Either can be ongoing when you are not actively planning an attempt. I fall somewhere in-between, am tending more toward passive lately which seems like a "so close yet so far" victory of questionable permanence, prompting this question. But  I thought this TW was the most appropriate flair.

Trying to read everybody's,

STAY PASSIVE!! (If there is currently no other option.)
