My boyfriend says my parents are too controlling
I (21M) moved out of my parents’ house this fall to go back to school. I was living at home until then, as classes were online and there was no point in paying for an apartment just to sit at home all day.  

Since going back to school, I’ve really flourished. My days are long, but I don’t mind. I work two part-time jobs, I’m a full-time student, I research, I’m on the executive board for two clubs, and I do domestic violence education at my school. At school, I go where I want, as long as my feet or bike can get me there. Not to brag, but I’ve become well-known on campus, with people recognizing me on the street. Needless to say, I’ve take advantage of the freedom I have.  

It wasn’t like this at my parents’ house though. And now that I’m home for winter break, it’s painful. At my parents’ house, I’m not allowed to really go much of anywhere without permission. I can’t stay out late. I can’t even bike to the library, as they say that road is “dangerous” (much safer than many roads at my school). I have to ask permission to see my bf (who lives here) and my curfew is usually somewhere between 7:30 and 8:00 pm. My dad sets an alarm for the house and won’t give me access to it so I can stay out late. All winter break, I’ve basically been sitting and reading because I can’t go much of anywhere. It’s really frustrating. I take any chance I can to visit my boyfriend because my family argues a ton and it’s really stressful being in that crossfire. The littlest things cause a fight, like cussing or laughing at the wrong time. Plus, I feel like a nobody here and I’m bored out of my mind. My mental health is deteriorating being here.  

My boyfriend said my parents are too controlling. His dad thinks I should have access to the alarm so I can go out late and that it’s crazy I can’t stay out as a grown man.  

Is it too controlling? Is this normal behavior?
