What triggered your loneliness
You definitely don't have to share if you don't feel like it and I'll make sure not to judge anyone.
The reason im asking this cause what triggered my loneliness and depression is something super weird.
Like I was enjoying my introverted life whencone day a friend of mine drunk texted me her nudes.
I deleted the pics cause im not an ass and she apologized the next day.
But literally the next day i started feeling so lonely and depressed
I also felt super guilty since i saw that nude for some reason
And I've been feeling like that ever since.


Edit: for people who feel like sharing but don't want to post in the comments. Feel free to DM I'd love to listen to you
