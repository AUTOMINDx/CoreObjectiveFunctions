A Festive Dilemma: Is it unreasonable to not allow one family member to stay for xmas in our home for the safety of another?
TL;DR Oldest child triggers PTSD for youngest child when staying in the same house, but I can’t ‘choose’ between my children. 

Our oldest (31 F) has many psychiatric disorders and is diagnosed with high-functioning ASD (she uses these words for her diagnosis). Our two other children (27 &amp; 21 F) have experienced long periods of abuse from her over their childhoods and into adulthood. (Please do not attack, I cannot express the regret and shame I feel for not protecting them or doing a better job). My youngest, who still lives at home, has requested that her sibling does not STAY at our home over the festive week for her own safety. She may come for xmas lunch but not stay. Last year her staying led to SH with my youngest, but I still couldn’t say no to my other child. I feel genuinely torn and I do not know what to do. My oldest is incredibly lonely and volatile and her reaction to not being able to come would be disastrous for months because she refuses to get help, but my youngest suffers so terribly from PTSD associated with my oldest. She says that my oldest ‘has another home (her apartment)’ but that our home is her (youngest) only ‘safe space’ and she has nowhere else to turn if necessary. I truly don’t know what to do. I know that my youngest is a good girl and will forgive me eventually whatever decision I make, but my oldest would tip over the edge and I don’t know whether I can shoulder the burden of her outbursts. I can’t tell my child not to come home for christmas but I don’t want another child to suffer. Please, please help me.
