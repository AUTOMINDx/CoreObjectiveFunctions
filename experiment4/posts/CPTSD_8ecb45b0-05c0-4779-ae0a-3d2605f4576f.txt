Yes, my childhood experiences cause me to interpret a parent's behavior as potentially abusive sooner than others would. Yes I have a bias, so? A healthy childhood gives you a bias to cut parents way too much slack.
This is just a small rant. It annoys the shit out of me when people with healthy childhoods call my interpretations biased without ever considering whether they might have a bias leaning in the opposite direction. 

Congrats *Hannah*, you've figured out that past experiences influence current perception. Why do you seem to think that that only applies to everyone else and not you though?

Ugh.
