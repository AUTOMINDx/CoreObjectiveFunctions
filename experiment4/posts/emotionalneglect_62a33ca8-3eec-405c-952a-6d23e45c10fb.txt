I crave physical closeness in ways that most people grow out of at my age.
My parents were either absent or preoccupied with more important things for most of my life. I was left to take care of my siblings so I didn't have much time to do normal kid things like have close friendships, and I didn't know enough about my own sensory needs to set boundaries so I avoided touch whenever possible. I finally started healing and letting my guard down in high school and became part of a friend group that was very physically affectionate. I learned to like hugs and piling on a three-person couch with four or five other people. I could even sit in a car with other people and not cringe away. But now that we're all adults, everybody else seems to have grown past needing that from their friends and I'm the only one who still craves that. Talking about it makes me cry. I hate that I have to have a romantic partner in order to find that sort of physical closeness again.

And whenever I talk about this with trusted people, they say "oh, so you want friends with benefits." NO! I don't want sex! I want to be able to touch another human without it being a whole Thing!

I know about queerplatonic relationships but my friends aren't into that idea and say it's unhealthy. My therapist gave a noncommital response when I mentioned it.

EDIT: To clarify, I just asked my therapist if queerplatonic relationships were healthy. I didn't ask if we could be in one. That would be wildly inappropriate.
