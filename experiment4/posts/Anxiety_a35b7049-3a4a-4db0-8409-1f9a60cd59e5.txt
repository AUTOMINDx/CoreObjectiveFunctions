I just found out about the 3-3-3 Rule and cried out of happiness because it changed everything.
I'm prone to anxiety attacks and handle them well but lately between moving and HRT they've been terrifyingly worse.
I just learned 3-3-3: Name 3 things you see, 3 things you hear, then move 3 parts of your body.
My attacks almost instantly go away, if you have never heard of this try it. It snaps your brain back to reality, and I had so much doubt while learning how to do it that it working so well legit caught me off guard.
