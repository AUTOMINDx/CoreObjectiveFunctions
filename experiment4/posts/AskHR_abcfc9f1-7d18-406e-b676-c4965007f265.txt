[CA] boss is going to have a talk with me about starting to monitor our email inbox on the weekends. How do I approach this conversation constructively? (boss is also HR)
Small company, team of 15 including me. My boss wants me to start answering customer inquiries and emails and stuff on the weekends and outside business hours, so I would be on call 24/7 to answer any email that comes in. I'm not willing to work for free or honestly give up all my free time with 0 work/life balance. How should I talk to him about this?
