My mother came around, but...
I posted here a day or two ago about coming out to my family as trans and how my mother in particular was very hostile about it. Did the classic making it about her feelings, saying in her mind ill always be her son, [Deadname], said she'd cry over the loss of me, and compared me to pedophiles. The whole shebang. I warned her if she continued to act that way/didn't apologize that I would stop talking to her and not see her for the holidays. 

Well she did just that, but its hard to tell how she will actually behave in person, as right now I sense she is behaving so I don't leave her life. Which is understandable, and is partially the goal when setting those boundaries. I want to go home for Christmas but id be lying if I said I wasn't a bit scared about the whole ordeal. She has a history of being vocally abusive and I fear she might say or do something at the very least undertoned with transphobia. I think at the end of the day I should just go home and deal with it if it's marginal, as I honestly didn't even expect to get this far with her by now. 

Thanks for the continued support, and I sympathize with anyone scared for the holidays, or just flat out alone because they don't feel safe with family. I pray we all find the courage we need üôè ‚ù§
