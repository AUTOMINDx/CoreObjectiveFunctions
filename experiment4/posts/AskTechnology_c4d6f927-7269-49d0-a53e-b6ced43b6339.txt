Advice on servicing my MacBook
I have a problem regarding my MacBook and would appreciate if anyone can give me some advice.

So I sent my MacBook to be serviced at an authorised Apple store because it was showing me “service recommended”, and the battery was having a little bit of difficulty being charged. On the day of the meeting the Apple guy ran some diagnostic test, and concluded that it was probably a battery problem, and quoted me around $300 to have it replaced, and I said okay.

Fast forwards a few days later, Apple sends me another email asking me to call them, and they are now telling me that changing the battery doesn’t fix the problem, and I now have to pay $500+300 to change/fix the logic board as well. I’m not too sure how legit this is because my MacBook is still usable barring some minor battery problems.

I’m very confused as to what I should do next because it was not as if my MacBook was inoperable, just that the battery was depleting faster than usual. If I was paying so much, I might as well get a new laptop entirely. Does anyone have any suggestions on my best course of action and thank you in advance for your help!
