Accepted verbal job offer, but let my boss know too early. What do I do now?
OK, I need some help thinking through this, so I thought I’d put this here. I made a mistake and am now trying to navigate it. Sorry for the novel. 

A few weeks ago, a recruiter called me. I decided to entertain the offer. After multiple rounds of interviews, I was offered the job: I received an email with numbers and a tentative start date. And the numbers were excellent: 20% raise, guaranteed 15% bonus, unlimited PTO, fully-paid medical benefits, great benefits otherwise, and a sizable stock grant. 

They wanted me to start in 3 weeks and were VERY insistent on hurrying through the process. Because I’ve been at my company for 9 years, because it’s the holidays and many people are off, and because I know it won’t be easy to replace me, I decided to tell my boss. 

Here was my mistake: I hadn’t yet received an offer letter.

My company went into gear and counter offered: 10% raise. That’s the best they can do. 

I really like what I do and love my boss, but I’m not confident about the company: They’re not in a great financial position, and I’m not confident of the signals I’ve been receiving from top leadership. I’m also a manager, and was told at the start of the year that I needed to fire half my team and replace them with offshore workers. Due to the nature of my work, I’ve felt like they’re setting me up for failure with this move. 

This is WHY I started entertaining offers in the first place. 

I’ve also started to see my career stall: many of my peers who’ve remained have moved to higher positions, and I’ve seemingly hit a ceiling. 

Apparently, the new company has already told my new team, as I’ve seen some of my future employees looking me up on LinkedIn. But the process has been delayed: lots of people being hired, so it’s taking time to finalize the contracts. 

It’s been about a week after the verbal (email) offer was given and verbally (email) accepted. Because of this delay, my start date was moved to 6 weeks from now. My current company is telling me I need to make a choice no later than this coming Tuesday at 5pm. 

My questions:

* Do I accept my company’s counteroffer and reject the new company, even if I’ve poisoned my relationship with my current employer? 

* Or do I roll the dice and hope this verbal offer really has already gotten all the email approvals (as per the recruiter) and is just waiting on the official approval of contract verbiage from their HR department)? 

The new company is well established. They’re growing, and they’re well funded. But because I was trying to be a “nice guy” to my current company, I showed my hand too early.

**Best case if I reject my company’s offer:** I get the offer letter and the new job starts in February. 

**Worst case:** something falls through and I’m jobless in the middle of a move. (Oh yeah, I’m also moving across the country. Both jobs are remote.) My current job pays well, so replacing this would be at a loss, most likely. 

**Most likely scenario:** ??? Well, that’s what I’m asking about, I guess.  

Do I accept the counteroffer? Or do I roll the dice? Yes, I know I made a mistake showing my hand too early. I’m just trying to figure out what to do with the fallout. 

Edit: *What are the chances a verbal offer like this, where the recruiter has verified that “all the email appprovals have already happened, and it’s just a matter of getting the letter out”, would be rescinded?* 

Thanks in advance.
