My social battery has dropped tremendously out of nowhere. Does anybody know what's wrong with me?
I have always been a fairly extroverted person, usually at the centre of the conversation or the crazy antics going on. The last few weeks I've found my social battery to be much lower than it normally is. I just don't have the capacity to be social for more than an hour at a time right now. I'm more reclusive, not joining in on conversations or even just completely tuning out. I feel watched even when I do speak and it makes me feel annoying. It's like everything I have to say is bothering them (there is nothing my friends are doing to make me feel this way, I've been more insecure than usual lately) I'm feeling awful about it because it's causing my partner to be quieter aswell. She is also normally very involved in the conversation but when I get like this she pulls back in order to make me feel better.
There's nothing like it. Being in a room full of people yet feeling utterly alone.


EDIT: All these comments are really giving me faith. It's a lovely thing to witness the goodness some people can exhibit
