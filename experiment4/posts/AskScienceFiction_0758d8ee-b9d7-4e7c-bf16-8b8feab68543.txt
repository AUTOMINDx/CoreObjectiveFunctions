[Harry Potter] I just found a dead, but still warm unicorn. While I can’t do anything for the unicorn, I do know that it’s blood could help many who are within an inch of life. Will collecting the blood, give those in need a cursed life?
I heard an attack over the ridge.  Before I got to the top though, I watched a Norwegian Ridgeback fly away.   On the other side, is a dead unicorn.  Being the potioneer that I am, I always have multiple flasks tucked away, for just such occasions.   


We all know how rare but beneficial unicorn blood is.  As we all know, it’ll keep someone even an inch from death alive longer if they drink it. But there’s a caveat… to kill such a beautiful and pure animal will leave you with a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips


But I didn’t kill the unicorn.  I don’t even plan on profiting from this beautiful creature’s death because I’ll be donating everything to St. Mungos. 

After I collect the blood and hairs (and any other useful parts); I even plan on burying the animal.

Will the recipients of the blood, still live a cursed life?
