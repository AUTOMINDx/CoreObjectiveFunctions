Is it normal for depression to cause fatigue?
I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD, the works lmao. Is it normal to feel so tired &amp; sluggish all of the time? Even shortly after just waking up or before even doing anything productive? It’s so hard when I have things to do, but I have no energy to do them, for no direct reason. I’m not really sure how to find the energy. As soon as I wake up, I want to go back to sleep. Does anybody have any advice or tips?
