Why sometimes I suddenly feel confident and have desire to socialize and the next day I feel lost again. What's going on in my brain?
So I really wanna know how my mind works. I am very uncomfortable in social situations due to my low self-esteem. Sometimes, there is a time where I feel really comfortable about myself without even trying anything such as meditation, self hypnosis or any affirmations. I just naturally become so confident for a day and I was able to communicate well with people. I was really happy when that happened I thought I finally survived my problem but it's only for that day. The next day, I find my self lost again and no desire to socialize. I become conscious to what I say compared to my confident self yesterday. Why is this happening? What could be wrong? I wish I'm consistent with being confident, but the next day I become lost again. This has happened many times. What kind of person (professional) can explain me why I'm acting like this?
