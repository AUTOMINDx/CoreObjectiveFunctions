NMom accidentally called me cute
One time while my family was sifting through a box of old photos my Nmom found a poorly lit Polaroid of me cracking up laughing. She started laughing and said, "Aww, look at this cute picture of me! I'm so adorable!" She showed it to several people. I looked and said, "That's me." She looked horrified and snatched it back. GC sister confirmed, "Yup, that's &lt;sister&gt;, not you." My Nmom shrieked, "EWW, NO! GROSS!" and ran away crying because she was so embarrassed that she accidentally called me cute (normally she called me ugly and disgusting) and saw something of herself in my features.

My Ndad said I was mean and should have just let her think it was a picture of her.
