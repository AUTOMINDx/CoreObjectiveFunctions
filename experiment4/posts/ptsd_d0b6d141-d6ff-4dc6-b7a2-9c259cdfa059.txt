Can’t find any remote jobs and I can’t function in a in-person job.
I feel so hopeless, I have been sending resumes and cover letters to remote job listings every day and I will only hear back from 2% with an automated rejection. I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t find any resources that help people with PTSD find work. 

My husband has been working 6 days a week to keep us afloat and I feel so horrible. I WANT to work. I’m so frustrated. The longer it takes to find work the worse the gap in my resume looks. I wish someone would at least email or call me back. I feel so worthless at this point.
