not sure what to do
I think I was considering writing this post for a long while
I'm very nearly 20 years old, a virgin and never had a girlfriend

now I'm not entirely sure why that is that I want a girlfriend so badly, is it because I want to experience sex for the first time, is it because I want that physical contact with someone, or I just want a good friend I can dump feelings onto all the time and count on when I'm lonely

whichever the case I recognize that as long as I'm so locked on to getting one, I never will
but still, I can't seem to really let go, it's just burning in me for some reason
somehow every time I'm left alone to think, I think about how much I want it

So here I'm left 5am, sitting lonely again thinking about what can I do about this situation, I don't think I know what to do to be honest, which is why I'm asking for help

please someone who was in this state or knows what to do
enlighten me
