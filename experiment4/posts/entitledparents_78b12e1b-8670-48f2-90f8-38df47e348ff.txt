Late Husbands estranged abusive parents are demanding access to my unborn son.
I am a thirty year old woman who lost my husband to cancer last year, we'd always wanted kids so we had some of his sperm frozen for a later date. Sadly he lost his battle and passed away.

I am now in a place where I feel capable mentally of taking care of a child myself and it was a success, I am expecting a little boy, my husbands parents somehow got wind of this and are constantly demanding that they be allowed in my sons life as he will be the last part of their son.

The thing is though, my husband had nothing to do with his parents, growing up they were emotionally abusive to him and he got out of there as soon as he could, he hadn't spoken to them in ten years and when it became clear things were taking a nosedive he made sure I knew he didn't want them at the funeral.

I do not think he'd want them in our sons life at all either so i'm trying to respect his wishes but family and friends are telling me I should give them a chance, that perhaps they have changed and how this could be a second chance for them, perhaps it's cruel but I don't want my son to be a guinea pig to trial run if they're better is it an asshole move to not give them the chance to prove themselves and deny them contact with my son? My own parents have said how if the positions were reversed it'd break their hearts to be kept from my child, they have suggested supervised visits but I am against even that. I'm feeling under so much stress about this as they're constantly messaging my social media and i've had to block them and they've even been coming to my Home to try and convince me.
