Does anyone else feel the urge to ghost everything and everyone??
Disconnected from all my friends, deleted all my social media, and bottled everything up again. I don’t know why. It’s been nearly 2 years since I’ve gotten a true genuine hug, 1 1/2 years since I’ve felt like I mattered to someone. I keep saying 2022 will be better and my year but haven’t we been saying that each year and still miserable. For most of 2021, I was able to stay busy but due to mental illness, I stopped working and moved my classes to remote. I’m hardly ever out of the house and I spend more hours looking at the ceiling than I probably do getting social interactions. "Sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me." I think about this a lot. Maybe I'm just numb to the idea that anything good could happen to me now. Anything I had to offer this world or to someone is just gone. 

I suppose it’s my fault for disconnecting myself from society.
