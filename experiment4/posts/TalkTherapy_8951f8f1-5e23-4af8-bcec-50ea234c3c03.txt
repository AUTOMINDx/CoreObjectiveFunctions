DAE wonder if therapists are doing okay?
Does anyone else ever wonder if therapists are doing okay? I mean, they are human and stuff.  Idk, a therapist's job just seems incredibly difficult. Helping someone through trauma, mental illness, rough times etc. is very challenging work. Not to mention therapists generally have multiple clients, so it's not just unpacking one person's issues, but multiple.

I understand that a licensed mental health care professionals are (hopefully) trained on how to cope with other people's issues. However, I know that it can be a lot more difficult to apply various therapeutic methods in practice on yourself.

I mean, I'm someone who's never worked in like a super high stakes job before, but even I would end up bringing work home with me, so to speak. I think it's pretty unlikely that therapists don't do this, too.

I don't mean to sound like I feel guilty for sharing my issues with my therapist. That's my therapist's job and I pay him for his services. Sometimes, I just wonder how the hell do therapists cope with other people's issues on top of their own? Do they go to therapy, too? Are they actually doing okay?
