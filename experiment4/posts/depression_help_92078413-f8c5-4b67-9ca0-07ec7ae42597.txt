Lonely
I just want someone to come out my laundry away, let me take a shower without having to get out half way through because kids are crying, I want someone to vacuum and mop so I can sit and relax. I have done 3 loads of laundry today, vacuumed at least 5, and mopped twice. I have conditioner still in my hair and I’m covered in baby food AGAIN. Y’all wonder why SAHMs are tired, grumpy, don’t want to be touched or loved on at the end of the day and just want alone time even before going to bed. This is why. I love my kids and I’d do anything for them but it’s so freaking hard. My back always hurts, I always feel ugly,  and I never get a break even when I was sick cause even when their dad is home they still only want or need me. When he was sick he got to sleep in and be alone. I don’t get to have that because one is breast fed and my anxiety won’t let anyone else care for my babies. But my depression says go cry in the bath tub with music so loud I can’t even hear myself think. My husband and I argue and it’s only about one thing. I never want sex…And it’s because I’m depressed, tired, anxious, angry, grossed out by myself, touched out from kids climbing on me or nursing all day, and just annoyed by every little thing because I’m just done. I love my kids but if you plan on becoming a stay at home mother or father anytime soon just know this is the reality. There are no villages anymore you’re on your own. Marriages are failing because the SAHP feels alone and scared to talk to a doctor for fear of having kids taken away or being put into a facility. You. Are. Alone.
