How much chemistry should I learn for Philosophy of Chemistry?
Iâ€™m of the impression that PhilofChem tends to get the back burner compared to physics and bio and I wish to read philosophers like Eric Scerri and Chemists like Ronald Hoffman, but how far do I have to take my studies for it to start to be accessible. The prerequisites for philosophy of physics and bio seem more straightforward as they are topic based.

(I know preferably as much as possible, but there needs to be a rough barrier to entry for study)
