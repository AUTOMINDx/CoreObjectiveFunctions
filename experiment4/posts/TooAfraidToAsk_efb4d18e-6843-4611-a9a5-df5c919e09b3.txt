Do people actually get excited about pictures of their friend's/co-worker's baby or is everybody faking it?
I'm a child-free woman (mid-30's) so my viewpoint might be skewed.  Whenever a co-worker shows me pics or movies of their baby, I always go "awww!" because I know that's the reaction they want.  In reality, I don't give two shits about that baby and most babies aren't even that cute to me.  I love my sister's kids and that's about it.  I confessed this to my other child-free friends and they all agreed that they're faking it.  One of my friends WITH kids said they were faking it because they understand that high of becoming a new parent, but they don't think their co-worker's baby is all that cute.  I've seen co-workers who go "show me pictures!" and their reaction feels genuine... but now I can't trust anybody because I'm a liar too!!!

So my question is--are we ALL faking it or are there people who genuinely enjoy seeing other people's baby photos??
