Intrusive thoughts but not suicidal
I’ve been struggling with a lot of depression. I’ve struggled since I was 10 or so. After getting COVID and suffering long haul symptoms, the depression has gotten so much worse. Debilitating. 

Lately I’ve been having intrusive thoughts. I’m not suicidal. I have no desire to end my life, *but* I keep having suicidal thoughts. I didn’t want to post this in suicide watch because frankly: im NOT suicidal. I know that. But it’s just these intrusive thoughts again and again. 

I’m seeing my therapist tomorrow. I just needed to let this out for now.
