Do you ever feel like you know nothing?
I've met some brilliant fucking people in my career (auto part quality) and you leave a meeting thinking you're completely fucking retarded. LOL

It's just fascinating to find people that are so good at what they do it blows your mind. 

For example, we had a stamping/die engineer that could run his hand over a die and within thousands of an inch could tell which areas needed work. 40+ years of experience. Everyone would make fun of him for being some wizard or 'old school' until the scans proved him right (repeatedly). 

I love engineering but sometimes I go through things like 'how the hell did I make it this far when he/she knows this much' lol
