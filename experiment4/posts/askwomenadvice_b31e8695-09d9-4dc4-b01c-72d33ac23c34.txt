I wish I was THAT girl lol. I don’t mean super popular, I just wish I had my life together and felt respected. I’m a mess and insecure. Any advice?
I’m constantly tired, I’m unattractive and no matter what I do to accentuate my best features I still feel looked down on, I wish I could have a routine involving exercise and healthy eating and work as well as rest but I don’t have the energy to maintain it. I secretly feel that no one likes me, and at the moment I just feel like that’s being proven. I cringe at everything I say. I want to be able to say ‘fuck them’ to anyone who doesn’t like me and move on, but I’m a people pleaser and I have a small social circle (I’m just quite introverted). How to I get confidence, the life I want, and any kind of sense of positivity? How do I make myself work for it? Can you really fake confidence and does it help?
