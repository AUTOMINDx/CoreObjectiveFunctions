I'm a constant liar under pressure and social situations.
I literally will say something else that pops up in my head that might be slightly related, and it will get screwed up in the conversation if what my mouth says, what my brain thinks, and what the conversation is currently about. 

Sometimes I even mean to say one thing but the words that come out of my mouth are the opposite. 

Person: I'm a nurse.
Me: awesome! being a nurse is amazing isn't it? 

In reality, what I mean to say is I've always thought highly of nurses wanted to be one at one point. I have this idealization of this field 

So the truth, my words, and grammer, come out wrong. Sometimes I mean to say yes but I literally say the opposite because I'm half there or under social stress.

I'm am socially inept and my brain and tongue know it. ALL the time, and I mumble unintentionally. Sometimes I don't know what to do actually so something comes out my mouth instead that doesn't register.
