Relationship anxiety
Currently in a relationship fairly new about 5 months, but I notice when I was single I really had it together I was eating good, working a lot and keeping myself busy. Although that life can get very lonely and depressing. I’m very happy with this person but when I’m away from them I feel very anxious and negative or doubtful or have thoughts of not trusting them which they have never given me a reason not to trust them. I really don’t want to damage the relationship because I really do like the person. Seeking advice to help calm myself or tools that have helped you all. I started taking cbd oil and I start therapy this month. Feed back is appreciated
