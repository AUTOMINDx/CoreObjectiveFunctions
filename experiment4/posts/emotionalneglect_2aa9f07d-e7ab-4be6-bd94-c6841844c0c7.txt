My parents never protected me from my siblings
My (25F) siblings were horrible to me growing up. They hit me, insulted me, and were just so abusive to me, particularly my oldest sister. She’s still horrible to me and I’ve gone low contact with both of them. 

My parents never protected me from them and almost always sided with my sister. Like when I was 7 and my oldest sister (13) stole my crayons and I was mad, they let her take one more of my toys because I wasn’t “sharing”. Or when she’d ridicule my appearance over and over again, they said nothing. Or when she told me she’d do my makeup when I was 8 and then purposely did it horribly so her friends that were over would laugh at me, and my parents told me to get over myself when I was crying. They were so scared of setting her off that they’d let her do anything to me or would defend her.
