It’s not the sadness that kills people, it’s the shame
sadness is a part of life, we may feel sad in life but it doesn't make us depressed or feel the need to die. depression to me seems to be a combination of both shame and sadness. I can find days where I feel sad and gloomy, but there are days where I am just so ashamed of myself, and life, I cant even stand to look at my own reflection. I don't know why depression carries the trait of shame, but sometimes this shame we have convinces us that others feel the same way of us too. and that becomes too much to handle so we just lock ourselves away. I know this may be my outlook on depression, but maybe you feel the same way as I. that it's the shame that follows depression that can kill us.
