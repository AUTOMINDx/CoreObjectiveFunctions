Lying that "I'm fine" is too draining. How else can i answer or divert the question of "how are you"?
I know people only ask mostly out of courtesy. Rarely do people mean genuine concern, albeit sometimes they certainly do.

Either way, I'm a bit tired of saying "I'm fine" and having to act like it. I also can't say I'm not and blurt out a bunch of negativity next.

What are other ways to answer this question? My creativity is stumped, but I'm trying to prepare myself with a better response especially considering Christmas and the new year is coming and i probably have to deal with more social situations. Thanks!
