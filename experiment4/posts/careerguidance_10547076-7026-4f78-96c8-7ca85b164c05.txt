I'm not getting Property Manager interviews with 14 years experience. What am I doing wrong?
Greetings everyone,

**My Field + Experience**

I'm a licensed Realtor who has worked in residential property management for 14 years.  Seven years were licensed, seven years as an unlicensed assistant during peak seasons with school &amp; odd jobs to compensate.  I'm willing to share linked in profile &amp; resume via DM.

**Situation**

I worked for one company the majority of that time.  When the boss decided to sell I made an offer to buy, however I was outbid by a coworker.  I was a pillar in that office, so my job was "secure" however it had now become a dead end. My salary was functionally capped at $50k per year which I wasn't content to do, as Property Managers in my area can make 6 figures. I have always done Real Estate Sales to improve my income, however this has always been during off hours, nights, weekends, holidays.  It was not uncommon for me to work another 20 hours on top of a 50 hour work week during peak season.  This isn't sustainable for me anymore.

When that position became a dead end, I moved firms for a year to learn sales better. I was able to match my income, however I still run into the problem that Sales doesn't fit my lifestyle.  It's a lot of nights and weekends which means I'm working while the rest of my family is 'off'.

My ultimate goal was and is to get back into Property Management and run my own team.  Once I was confident I had the tools to continue growing the sales &amp; marketing side of my business, I began searching for a Property Management Leadership position.

**Roadblocks**

I paid a small fee to a professional to help set up my Linked In, Resume, Cover Letter, etc. The first roadblock I noticed was that most (if not all) Senior Management positions required a CPM certification.  This was not something we valued at my previous firm, but it is well within my ability to obtain.  The only thing holding me back is that it's about a year of schooling and the price is steep on my sales income alone.

So I set my sights on a Mid-Level associate position, which is what I've been doing for the past 7 years.  The goal here is to get my foot back in the door of Property Management to keep earning "years of experience", use the salary to get the CPM certification, and work my way up to a Senior Management.

However... I am not getting callbacks on any Mid Level positions.  I received ONE callback, however they dropped the salary from $59,000 to $36,000.  Recruiters are tapping me for entry level positions, however those barely pay more than fast food and I'm far overqualified.

**I feel a bit stuck...**

&amp;#x200B;

* I apply for about 5 positions a week which feels like a significant amount?
* I'm using Linked In which I hear is the premium site for such things.
* I have the professional resume &amp; profile,
* Should I do things the old fashioned way and mail my resume to local Property Managers?  


Assistance would be appreciated.
