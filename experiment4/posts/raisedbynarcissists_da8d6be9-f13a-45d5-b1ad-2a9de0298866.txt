What common phrases do you seem to hear from your narcissistic parent?
I'll start....
"I didn't say that!"
"That was a long time ago!" 
"It's not that big a deal!"
"You need to get over that!"
"Why are you being so sensitive?"
"Why are you blowing this out of proportion?"... and of course.....
"What is wrong with YOU?!"

In my case, I started to question myself.  I would think.... maybe it is me,  maybe I am the problem, maybe I am overreacting, maybe it wasn't that big a deal,  why can't I just get over it? 
After 41 years of my life with my C-narc mom I finally realized that I'm not the problem, she is! And no matter what I do or how much of it I do, it will NEVER be enough for her. I will never live up to her standards. Her hypocritical double standard views are just that,  hypocritical double standard fantasies she has envisioned in her head that keep changing with her moods.
I love my mom but she obviously doesn't love me. I have come to the conclusion that I can love her but it doesn't mean that I have to like her or that u have to keep her in my life to continue to abuse me and abuse her position as a mom.
I'm now looking for my own home, which isn't easy in California but I can't continue this anymore.  It's too much for anyone to have to endure on a daily basis... wish me luck on finding a home soonðŸ¤ž
