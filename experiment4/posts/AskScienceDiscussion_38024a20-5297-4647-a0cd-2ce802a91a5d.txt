Why does having a number of neutrons more than a proton inside the nucleus of an atom make it "Unstable"?
In physics textbooks we are thaught

&gt;If the number of neutrons are much more than number of protons in their nucleus atoms are unstable and undergo radioactive decay

In chemistry textbooks we are thaught

&gt;Elements with n/p(neutron/proton)ratio around 1 are stable.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elements with n/p ratio more than 1.5 are unstable and are radioactive

But none of the textbooks actually explain why they are stable or unstable. 

Can anyone explain it to me?
