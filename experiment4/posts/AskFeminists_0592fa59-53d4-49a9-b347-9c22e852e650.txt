How can I explain to a person that lacks empathy for women who have been sexually abused, that sometimes the victims cannot just simply say “NO” and easily walk away from the moment that the sexual assault/abuse is taking place?
Edit: adding some context

Some days ago I was talking to a friend of mine about sexual abuses. She was insisting that part of the fault of women who haven been sexually assault is due to their lack of assertiveness, their naive way of thinking that make them trusting to manipulators, the lack of education in this regard and whatnot and all this together, makes women fall easily into the trap of being manipulated and as a result, being sexually assaulted/abused.

Although, I may see some sort of truth in her statement regarding that women should have more education about how to stop or say no in certain situations, the only thing I am pretty sure about is that women are not the ones to be blamed or the ones to be pointed out when they have been the victims of any kind of sexual abuse. They are the victims and we shouldn’t re-victimized them and especially, tell them how they should or should have not behaved in a situation like that.
