AITA is I stop reaching out to my racist family?
I’m in the United States. My family is Caucasian, from the south, and super racist. My GP literally says that black people are demons. I myself am biracial. They’re aware I’m multiracial and that I look multiracial. But they just consider me white. Even though I was made fun of constantly for being multiracial in school (it’s a mostly white community). They’re part of a popular conspiracy group (not going to mention it here) and believe white people are superior. I was only allowed to date white boys in school (no one wanted me anyway until I worked in a more diverse area then suddenly flocks of people of all different colors decided I was hot). I am married and have children now. I moved away from family and we now live in a diverse area. I’m really afraid my family would put ideas in my kids heads and lower their self esteem and sense of identity like they did mine. AITA if I skip most family functions?
