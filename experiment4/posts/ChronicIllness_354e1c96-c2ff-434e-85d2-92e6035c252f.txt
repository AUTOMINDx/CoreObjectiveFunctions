I think I'm going to starve to death as a result of long covid and I don't know what to do
EDIT - Thank you to [**Some-Lawfulness5108**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Some-Lawfulness5108/)  who gave me silver.  I am grateful for the gift, internet friend. Thank you to everyone else too, for all the brainstorming and creative thinking, kind words - both thoughtful and practical. I really, really appreciate it.   xxx

In Dec last year I had covid. It's been a year and my tastebuds are still hypersensitive and my sense of smell is very, very strong to match. I am wasting away into nothing and don't know what to do about it. I have no energy and I'm really flagging all the time. I can't sleep because I'm so hungry. I eat and very easily get a migraine from the overstimulation, so I'm in a vicious cycle. I don't know what to do.

I know this isn't a long covid forum but this really is chronic illness that i'm suffering with. I'm wondering if any of you are really struggling with food, and what you rely on to get the calories. I don't even care as much about nutrition right now, I just need energy to get some strength. I drink a UK drink called lucozade which is just glucose really; it's known here as a drink for people who are recovering from illness etc. Everything tastes and smells so disgusting to me, I'm so stuck, I'm so hungry all the time. I can't spare any more weight loss. I've tried Huel and vomited. I'm despairing
