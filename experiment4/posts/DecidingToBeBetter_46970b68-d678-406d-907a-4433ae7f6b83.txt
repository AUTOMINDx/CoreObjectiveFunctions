How can I believe i am an adult
Hey. So I’m almost 30. I do adult things.  Take care of myself, work, exercise, etc. But I don’t feel like an adult. Maybe I feel inferior. I grew up with a childhood that was constantly saying I wasn’t good enough, needed help, parents would talk for me, do things for me, not really allow me to have my own thoughts, not allow me to try things I want or learn things for myself. This mentality has somewhat been glued to who I am. It’s hard for me to do things without FEELING like I need help. Or listening to MY OWN thoughts and ideas. Or doing WHAT I WANT to do, and not what someone else wants me to do. Trying things I WANT to try, instead of feeling like it’s wrong for me to do so. I’m not trying to play the blame game, I’d like to just overcome this to better my life. Anyone go through something similar?
