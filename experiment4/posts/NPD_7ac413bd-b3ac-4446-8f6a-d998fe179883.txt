Is a Messiah complex related to NPD?
I often feel like it’s my responsibility to fix the worlds problems; hunger; poverty; war; etc. And that I’m destined to be some savior of humanity figure. I have way to unreasonably high expectations for myself, I often beat myself up because I’m no where near the position to be able to actually do something meaningful. Or feel like a failure despite succeeding in pretty much every aspect of my normal life. I also feel like I’m the only person who can accomplish these tasks.
