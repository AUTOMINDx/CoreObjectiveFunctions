[NSFW] Back when pictures had to be developed and you took naked pictures of yourself, would the employees have seen them?
I wasn't old enough to take naked pics of myself back when film cameras were the norm so I don't know how developing these would work. I just remember going to the store and handing in the roll and coming back after some time and get the pictures inside an envelope. So if I took naked pictures of myself and had them developed at the store, would the one in charge of doing this have seen my naked pictures?
