how do I tell a boy that condoms are nonnegotiable during sex
REPOST W EDITS 
I (F18)have hooked up with this guy (M21)twice and the sex was good but the second time he really complained about wearing the condom. About halfway through he stopped and said that the condom slipped off so I disengaged immediately. It doesn’t feel like he took it off on purpose but i think he thought i would just say that it was fine or something. I’m not worried about STDs with him because we both got screened pretty recently but I don’t use another form of contraception BUT I SHOULDNT HAVE TO. I want to text him about it but i don’t know what to say
TL;DR how can i firmly set boundaries about condoms w fwb
