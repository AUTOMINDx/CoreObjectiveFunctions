How to improve self-esteem?
To preface, I’ve had really intense anxiety/depression for over a decade. It’s steadily gotten worse and worse and I’m at a point now where I really can’t take it anymore. I thoroughly and completely hate myself and who I am as a person. I place all my self worth in approval from other people, my performance at work, etc. and it’s debilitating. I have no idea how to even begin to fix this, if that’s even possible, as I’m in such a dark place at the moment.
