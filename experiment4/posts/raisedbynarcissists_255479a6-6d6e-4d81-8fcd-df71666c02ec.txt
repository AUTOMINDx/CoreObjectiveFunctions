My Dad strangled me a few months back and I'm only now realising that I may be in danger
He has strangled me 2 times. Once when I was 10 years old. And another at 16 years old, a few months back in August. I'm now 17, turned in August. The second time it happened I took pictures, videos.

But my Enabling mother got me to accept his apology a few days later and guilt-tripped me. I  was programmed to think nothing of it. I thought, surely he wasn't or wouldn't try to kill me. So I never felt unsafe around him because my mum passed it off as nothing. But after some research, the next step is murder after strangling and now I'm scared. I can't imagine him doing it but you never know what someone will do when he gets in that crazy rage moment. Its a big red flag.

He's also emotionally abusive and makes threats constantly. What do I do right now?

Edit: I am a male and from the UK
