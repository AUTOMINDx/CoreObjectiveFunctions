[CA] Previous sexual harasser is now working for the new company I'm working for. What should I do?
This is a bit embarrassing but I was hoping you folks could provide some advice..

7  years ago or so I started a new job and a Director started sexually  harassing me, he'd follow me to bathrooms (I'm a man, and we're both  gay) and would ask to show him my cock. He would send me inappropriate  messages and I told him repeatedly that I wasn't interested and should  drop that shit at work.

One day a  fellow gay coworker confided that this guy was harassing him and we  realized he was doing it to others, we stepped up, told HR and the guy  got promptly canned after an investigation.

7  years later to last week, I start a new job and on my Zoom and see  someone with the same name (there were 100+ participants and his cam was  off). I checked his linkedin in incognito mode and low and behold it is  him! He had been canned from other TWO jobs after he was fired.

Now  what do I do? Should I tell HR at the new job what happened? There's no  evidence he's doing it NOW, wouldn't HR treat it as hearsay? They can't  ask the previous job if they fired him from harassment, can they?
