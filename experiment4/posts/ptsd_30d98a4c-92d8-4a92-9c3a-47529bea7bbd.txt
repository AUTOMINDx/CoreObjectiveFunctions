Do you ever feel you get sucked into a rush of memories that completely sweeps you up?
Often I find myself getting completely sucked into my memories, mostly pre trauma ones, and they completely sweep me off my feet for at least a week. For a week all I can do is REMEMBER. I can hardly focus on anything because I'm remembering that time my dad took me to a game when I was 8, or the time I fought with a friend in 6th grade, or literally anything at all that happened to me. Like how in movies a character's dying and their whole life flashes before their eyes, but I'm not dying.

I don't mean this as normal reminiscing. I mean I am so sucked into them that I find it hard to socialize and I feel super distant from my friends and reality. It's like part of me gets stuck in those memories for days on end. It's really hard to function normally when this is happening.

I never experienced this pre-trauma, and it's such a weird feeling because it's so bittersweet. Even the good memories hurt a bit because I feel so far removed from them.

Anyone else?
