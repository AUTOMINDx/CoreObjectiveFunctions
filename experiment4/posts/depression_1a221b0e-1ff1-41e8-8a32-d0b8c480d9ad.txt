So done. 47 yo f/married 26+ yts
Empty nester, father died last year, mother in hospice with maybe a week left. Life of severe depression. Medicated since 1992. Working full time, ordering my grown kids christmas gifts, guilt over those in wont get mailed in time,...car got a flat on the way to visit mother, two days later engine light comes on. Rent a car, anniversary date ruined when spouse gets drunk and announces he is no longer attracted to me, and he doesnt believe that I have ever been faithful. Accuses me of saying some guys name during sex.  Destriys the house, I get a hotel room...so I can sleep enough to get up and take care of my dying mom.  FUCK ME!!!
