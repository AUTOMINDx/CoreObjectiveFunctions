I am interested in video editing and graphic design and motion graphics. Is it worth it to pursue one of these, and if so how do I pursue it?
For context I am a 21m (22 in a few weeks) and I work part time at a grocery store and I still live with my parents.  I am aware this is pathetic and I am ashamed.  I went to college for a semester after highschool and then gave up.  After that  I tried multiple career paths but nothing ever stuck.  

I know these are pretty competitive fields but literally nothing else gets me excited like working on stuff like that.  I took a class about graphic design and a little bit of video editing in high school and I loved it.  I donâ€™t know what else to do so I may as well give it a shot.

Is there a good way to get educated on this stuff without college and actually manage to get my foot in the door?
