i got a bf but
im still not part of society. I don’t really have much history in this world. I basically laid depressed in my room for years, no life. no human connections whatsoever… it’s hard to make friends when you don’t have a history. 

i talk with my boyfriend and he reminds me of this. I didn’t go to any friends’ parties when i was younger, never had sex before him or any relationships, never experienced the normal young adult/college stuff, forget about the teen experience…. 

don’t have a loving family. the friends ive tried to make along the way turned out to see me as fifth wheel or just plain didn’t like me, talked bad about me.


i feel completely alien to this world. 
and I just want to not exist. i feel an ache in my chest that sometimes is apparent and i know it is my mind making it physically known that i am not well, i am not happy. i am tired and sleep doesn’t bring me energy.
