Had what felt like heart palpitation while recording ECG on apple watch, looks pretty bad?? Pic in post
Am I going to die basically. I was at rest and felt a flutter so started an ECG and then few seconds later during the ECG it happened again and you can see it recorded it, like these  rapid waves. The ECG didn't say anything was wrong but looks pretty bad to me? See below pic
