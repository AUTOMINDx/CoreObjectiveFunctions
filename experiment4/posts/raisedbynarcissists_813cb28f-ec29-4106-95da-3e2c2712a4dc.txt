The difference between my nmom's birthday card and mother in laws birthday text
Today was my birthday. My mom sent over a card with my sister that said "happy birthday. I hope you had a nice day. Mom and Dad."

This is the text my mother in law sent me

"Itâ€™s your berfday!!!! 

I am thankful for YOU, - and I truly appreciate you! 

You have the gift of counsel. You fully accept people (me!) where they are with zero judgement. Iâ€™m thankful for your listening ear,  your ability to see situations from more than one point of view, and your knack for problem solving. 

I appreciate your creative edge.  
You bring all the little finishing touches - the ones that pull it all together - not just to rooms/your home that you lovingly decorate â€”- but also to the relationships youâ€™re in. You are the finishing touch; you naturally offer bits of knowledge and advice and skill and creativity that Iâ€™m grateful for!!

We need you in our lives, !

Thank you for choosing (my husband) to Become One with!! 

Youâ€™ve enlarged our family in the best possible way!! 

Happy Happy HappyBirthday!!
You will always be loved by me ðŸ¤Ÿ

Love you! "
