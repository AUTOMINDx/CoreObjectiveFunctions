How do I (19F) deal with an emotionally abusive brother (21M)
None of my family backs me up because he’s not home often. My parents are pretty good at not showing favouritism but they will never stand up for me when my brother berates me and takes any opportunity to insult my personality. An example is this morning I was just chatting about how I wanted to celebrate Christmas like an American where they decorate elaborately and bake creative little treats because you don’t really have that in the UK and my family in particular isn’t really festive. He then took the opportunity to disagree and say that the only difference is that Americans have a lot of family round (not sure where this argument came from) and i said in this case I just wanted to decorate and bake and he got annoyed, told me I was argumentative and that I have no friends and struggle to make friends because of my terrible personality. This happens every single day and I’m called aggressive and argumentative for standing up for myself. He also explains simple things to me solely to remind me how stupid he thinks I am and then when I ask him not to he will manipulate the situation to seem as though he is being caring and I’m being aggressive. Sure, sometimes I misinterpret and cause arguments but it’s because I have to have all my walls up at all times because I’m so scared of what he might say to me. Sometimes he is physical too and he is a lot taller and stronger than me. Extended family prefers him and are closer with him so I just don’t know what to do or how to reach out to anyone I’m so distressed.

TLDR: emotionally abusive brother and no family to reach out to and I don’t know what to do
