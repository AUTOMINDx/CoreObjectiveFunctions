I (22F) accidentally triggered some Moms on instagram and got into an argument that won’t end
So, there was a post on instagram about the new Spider-Man movie and how a baby started crying and I commented that I don’t get why people feel entitled enough to bring their baby there who won’t remember a thing and just ruin peoples experience they paid for  (cause newsflash, it’s loud, it’s noisy of course baby will start to cry) 

I don’t know why, but they kinda picked my comment to complain

„Don’t judge people‘s situations…“ - I don’t, but want to watch that movie in peace

„Some don’t have a sitter“ - Okay and ? Than wait until it’s available on demand ig?

„You gotta expect babies in public places“ - yeah but this public place costs people a load of money, they waited two years for this movie and not for your baby crying 

„You’re entitled if you get people kicked out for it“ - I never did? That was the post

Like, it just takes a bit of decency. I get how hard it can be to be a parent and doing free time stuff, but that doesn’t give you a free pass for everything. 

Also,  I don’t know how it’s for you guys, but cinemas over here are expensive af and I am one of those people who don’t have much money for freedoms, so it’s like a little luxury. I don’t go smoking on playgrounds either, everything has it‘s place.

Im too tired to argue and it’s waisted energy, but kudos it didn’t go dirty.
