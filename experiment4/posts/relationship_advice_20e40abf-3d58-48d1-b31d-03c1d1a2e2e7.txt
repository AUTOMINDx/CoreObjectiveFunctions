Terminally ill. Want to make my S/O Happy before it.
I(29F) am a French Canadian. I am terminally ill and have max 1 year left. My husband(31M) is Indian and together for 6 year married for 3. He is very good human being and i think he love me very much as much  i do. It is hard for family on both side. He is making me comfortable and we are doing fun activity so that I  can spend my last days happily.

Yesterday husband made dinner for me  and then surprised me that he have a guitar which I did not know about he can play(Borrowed from a friend) and sing a song for me and was crying pretty hard and the ending of song. It was in Hindi language so did not understand meaning of it. So I asked him the name of the song and I was named “Mann Bharryaa 2.0” . I found the video and watched it with subtitle and got very emotional because of it. I am going to attach the lyrics which I copied from internet.

Thank you all of you. Sorry for my late reply. We have many video of us together. I always recorded and clicked picture of us because it was like living in a dream and I don’t wanted it to end.

So I am going to write him letters and record videos for his upcoming milestone. I will also try to make time capsule for him. I will try to edit videos of us to make compilation of best moment. All who were talking about religious believes I am atheist and he is  also kind of atheist(He once told he only remember god before exam and interview other time he is atheist). He said me once he is not sure that God is real or not, but if god is there and if people meet there loved one once again then I want to be able to say to them that I became the best human I could be. He was then talking about the parents he want to meet now I also want to be on that list.  I and he have nothing against religious persons.

Yesterday I wrote him a letter mainly telling my about felling toward him and how much I love him. I tried many times before to tell him that but I would get emotional and I will start to cry but in letter I tried to express him as much as I could. After that we went out watched Spider Man No Way Home and ate some street food. He was like the person he was before we found about my cancer. He made fun of me and I also tried but I do not have sense of humour like him but I tried. He also dance for me when we came back home I also did dance or I can say I jumped like a buffoon. It was special because first me met he was also doing some dance moves in IKEA to annoy and embarrass his friend. I am trying to make best moment of us we can and record. Thank you for your advice and sorry I could not reply to everyone. Thank you.

Bye, Now I am going to molest my husband.

Thank you once again for your advises.
