I feel guilty calling it neglect.
A small vent. 

I have been doing a lot of work in therapy lately, and my therapist and I have sort of reached the conclusion that my parents (and everyone else in my life) didn't meet my emotional needs as a child. 

Thing is, I feel really guilty complaining about it, even if it's in therapy for my childhood issues. 

My parents are good people. It's not like they meant to be emotionally unavailable. I don't really put any blame on them because of it. I get defensive when the word "neglect" is used. 

Besides, I feel like this is normal. My parents didn't abuse me. They always provided a roof over my head and quality food. I was yelled at a bit, and my dad could be rough, but it wasn't that bad. I wasn't close with my parents, and I was terribly lonely, but I didn't feel terrorised or anything.

They also had their good moments. My dad gave me great advice about law school. My mum tried sometimes to understand my OCD. They let me sleep in their bedroom when I was sad. I got hugs when I moved away, and they call me every few weeks. They didn't force me to come to funerals because they know I prefer dealing on my own. It's not like they ignored me or anything. 

I feel like I'm making it up and exaggerating the bad parts. Maybe I'm misremembering or purposely forgetting the good parts. 

Does anyone relate?
