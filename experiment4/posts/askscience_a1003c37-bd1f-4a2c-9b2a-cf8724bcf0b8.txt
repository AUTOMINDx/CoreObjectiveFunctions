Why do mosaic humans not get attacked by their own immune system?
I recently found out that genetic mosaicism exists, in which a single person has multiple different sets of DNA at a time, in different groups of cells.

However, it isn't clear to me why the body doesn't reject these cells with a different DNA, as is the case for e.g. organ transplants, or at least has immune responses between them?

Why does the immune system reject transplanted organs, but not genetic mosaic tissue?
