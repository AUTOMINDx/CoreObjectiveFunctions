My therapist is a phD but I can’t find her license?
Hey guys. I am so confused right now. I made a post in another sub about my therapist and someone said paying via Venmo isn’t HIPAA compliant. I looked into it and sure enough it isn’t. So i think, that’s weird, why would she do that? So I start looking for her therapy license through the California website and I don’t see her at all. I’m so confused - she has a phD, so can she do therapy? Would it be wrong of me to ask her for her license? I found one search of her on the CA website but it said their license was revoked (I’m really hoping it’s someone with the same name…) any thoughts would be helpful.

ETA: I asked for her license. She told me she doesn’t maintain her license since she doesn’t deal with insurance

UPDATE: So I got lucky and found a board meeting from last year in which she was trying to get her license back. It was revoked due to 9 criminal charges due to: forgery, being a caretaker and doing forgery or embezzlement of funds, driving without a license, driving under the influence, possession of meth, illegal bookmaking for bets, and disturbing the peace. 

She has been asking what my issue is with her not being licensed and wants to talk about it with me.
