Finding a job is more about dodging scams and shitty gigs than it is about actually looking for work.
Unless I want another retail job, any attempt at looking has just been a slog of scrutinizing websites and postings to ensure that I'm not getting fucked by sending them an application.

I've gotten into the habit of glassdooring every posting I see that looks remotely appealing, and 99% of the time I find countless red flags.

Yes, I know that reviews on sites like Glassdoor tend to be biased towards the negative, but when a handful of people come back with "owner is a crook, makes you pay for XYZ and sign contracts that lock you into it and you'll barely make enough to cover your own gas", it's hard to ignore that.

Because when I'm looking for work, I'm definitely in a position where I can get fucked for weeks or months by a new employer.

End rant.
