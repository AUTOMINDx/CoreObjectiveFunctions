I'm 16 and I want to quit
For context I'm 16 years old and started my first real job at a pizza place. I've been here for around 4 weeks. My boss yells and shouts at the employees even when costmers are In the store. I only get two 4 hour shifts a week at student minimum wage(which I have no problem with) and he will only put me in on Fri Sat or Sunday the busiest days and not any other time.

He put me on the phones taking orders which is the hardest thing to do within the first week and half and I get scolded if I make a mistake. He recently hired this new person to also help she is probly around 70 years old and is super nice and he will also get mad at her even though she just started 2 days ago. She even told me one day she almost walked out as he was yelling at us and she's scared to do any thing because of him.  My freinds dad was even in there one time with five other costemers as he was going off and ended up talking about it with my freind who also works there.(he hates it to) 

My parents and me are leaving over Christmas break for a week and I told him that I would not be here and sorry for any inconvenience and he replied with:  "you don't tell me, you are required to ask for it off". The problem is is that I don't really have a choice about when I'm here or not as I can't stay home alone for a week and my parents aren't not going to go becauseI need to work 8 hours. 

 I hate this job and I want to quit but he's training me to takeover for a guy that's leaving in a week so I don't know if it's the right thing to do. My parents say i don't owe him any thing and I should quit. 

I just want to hear the opinion of some experienced people. Thanks.
