UPDATE!! My (23f) husband (32m) keeps on talking to me about the risks of childbirth, mortality rates, etc. I’m six months pregnant-what can I say to him to stop?
Quick update on my post [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r9rnpx/my_23f_husband_32m_keeps_on_talking_to_me_about/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I got a lot of really great advice!! Long story short— I took my husband with me to a doctors appointment I had this week, and told him to voice all of his questions, concerns, and anything he thought I needed to know! We ended up having a LONG conversation with her, I THINK she appeased all of his fears but just in case she gave him her cell phone number and said if he had any more concerns to talk to her before he talks to me, lol. 

We also followed another suggestion and set up a hospital tour!! It’s going to be a virtual tour but I think he’s going to make him relax a lot!!! 


Thank you to those who gave great advice!!!
