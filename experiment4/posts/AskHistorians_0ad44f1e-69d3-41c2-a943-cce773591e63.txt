In many classic TV sitcoms, upper middle class families have a live-in maid. How common was this in America? When and why did families stop employing maids?
Examples of sitcoms include: Hazel, the Brady Bunch, Mr. Belvedere, the Fresh Prince, Jetsons.

Since I can’t relate, so many questions come to mind.  Here are a few:  

- Did middle class families really have maids/butlers in the 60s, 70s, and 80s?  Are there any statistics on this?

- Why did they live in the home, rather than a nearby house or apartment?

- Were they on payroll or 1099?

- Did they really wear maid/butler uniforms?  Did the maid/butler select their own uniform, or did the family dictate what was worn?

- When and why did families stop employing maids or butlers?

- How much did they get paid in today’s money?

Thanks for any and all replies.  I asked this question a few years ago, but there were no answers that mods didn’t remove.
