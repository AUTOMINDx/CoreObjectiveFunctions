Is It True That a Pocket Watch Was Found Amongst Skeletons in Leap Castle’s Oubliette Indicating That the Dungeon Was Used as Recently as the Mid 1800s?
[Leap Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_Castle) is an ancient castle in Coolderry, County Offaly, Ireland.


An [oubliette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon) or *bottle dungeon* is a basement room which is accessible only from a hatch or hole in a high ceiling.


[Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_Castle#Oubliette):

&gt; During renovation of the castle in the 1900s, workers found an oubliette behind a wall in the chapel.  At the bottom of the shaft were many human skeletons amassed on wooden spikes.  When cleaned out, it took three cartloads to remove the bones.  Today, the dungeon is now covered over in order to keep people away from it.  It is believed that the O'Carrolls would drop guests through the trap door to be impaled on the spikes 8 feet below.  A pocket watch found at the same time, dating from the mid 1800s, shows how recently the oubliette may have been used.


Alas, wikipedia doesn’t provide a very strong reference.


I’ve heard this story elsewhere (mostly in web pages and videos about the “hauntings” at Leap Castle) but can find no solid credible 3rd party sources.


I did find this paragraph from an article entitled [In Search of Ireland’s Nocturnal Nasties](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/90561964/in-search-of-irelands-nocturnal-nasties/) from the December 17th, 1988 edition of *The Age* (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) newspaper:

&gt; When the bottom of this chamber was emptied of its grisly contents early this century, five ponycarts of bones were taken away.  Worse, jewelry found with the bones showed the oubliette to have been used as recently as 1810.


But “jewelry from 1810” isn’t quite “pocket watch from the mid 1800s.”


My suspicion is that this is just some rumor that gets repeated due to the spookiness factor.
