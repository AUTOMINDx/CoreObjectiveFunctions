Jealousy towards other people's parents?
Just wondering if anyone has felt an overwhelming sense of jealousy toward someone else's parents. I keep catching myself feeling this way when my close friend casually talks about how both of her parents went back to school to get nursing degrees. I never let on that I'm feeling this way because I don't want her to feel uncomfortable sharing stories about them  (which is why I'm venting here). My parents have drained my savings and one of them drank their way out of a place to stay and had to live with me for a year. I know these things were my choice and I probably shouldn't have helped but I digress.

I especially feel these feeling around the holidays I have always craved huge gatherings, potlucks, family time and traditions but instead I have to shy away from these things. 

Please share stories of time when you have felt jealous lol make me feel less alone in this.
