'You don't have REAL ptsd' Please shut your mouth now
For fucks sake, I just got diagnosed two days ago, and two people told me I don't have 'real' ptsd. One literally said 'Real ptsd is childhood sexual abuse' and proceeded to insuinate my abuse wasn't bad enough to have it. Thank you, enlightened person, for having more psychological knowledge than my psychiatrist, doctor, and therapist combined ðŸ˜€ I'm so grateful. These people are also both mentally stable, trauma free and can't even begin to try to empathize. Fuck ptsd, fuck people
