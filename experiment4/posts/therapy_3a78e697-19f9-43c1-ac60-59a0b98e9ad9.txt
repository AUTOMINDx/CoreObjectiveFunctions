Burntout
I feel like I've been burnt out for a few years now, It's starting to reach a head. I have no motivation to really do anything. I know what I need to do, but there is just no energy to do it. I can plan out everything I need to do in order to get those things done, but I just have a complete lack of effort to do it. 
I usually stay secluded and could sit in my room all day. I like to say I'm on a intermittent fasting diet, but really I just never feel hungry or I forget to eat. 
I used to be a "go getter", I feel like I used to be able to accomplish anything I set my mind to. Now everything just seems to drain me just thinking about it.
I can't hold down a job, which is also because I've been working since I was 14 and I'm 33 now. I just don't see an end in site.

I want to feel successful and like me again.
