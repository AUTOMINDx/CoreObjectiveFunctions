My basic square explanation.
**Square = achievement aspect.**

Squares allow you to achieve, they bring the challenge, they are not bad as feeling a sense of achievement is amazing! Squares show you themes which may see struggles in your life. Its saying hey look at me, try to figure out what you could do differently, you may ask how do i know, look for similarities in the interactions you have across those areas of life the square hits.

(Example could be mars 11th square Pluto 3rd, This creates a HIGH amount of energy, regardless of house and  if not used will manifest as outbursts of anger. if its 11th/3rd house then this would result in a need for leading groups through communication, if unable to lead this can cause vile communication outbursts in frustration of not being able to lead. How to overcome you remove the need to lead and rather accept you can't lead everything, this keeps the great leadership ability and grants a patients that is infectious to those around you, aka abundance)

 Comparing interactions will allow you to compare actions and experience, which is useful for self understanding, once you see this you'll be able to compare outcomes which then teaches you how to aim the energy to your favour. 

Exploring is fun if you are learning to be a better you.
