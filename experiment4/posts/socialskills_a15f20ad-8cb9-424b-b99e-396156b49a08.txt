Am I a bad person for not giving a gift to most people?
TL;DR: Most of my life I never bought gifts for others. This Christmas I have no gift again and feel really guilty about it. How can I make gifting a habit?

Today is Christmas Eve and I don't have a gift for anyone. I will probably get something but I don't have anything to return the favor. 

In fact, for most of my life I never had a gift for others. As a kid and teenager I was somewhat egotistical and didn't really care about the feelings of others, so I never bothered about gifting. Of course, when I was invited to birthdays I brought a gift (which rarely happened, so I wasn't used to it that much). But when unsolicited, I never cared. 

Nowadays, I still often don't have anything to offer. The problem is that I'm sometimes really forgetful or occupied with other stuff. I also sometimes have bouts of depression and because of Covid I never felt like celebrating Christmas for the last two years. 

Today, I overheard a family member saying something like "It's really sad that there are some people who don't bother thinking about others". Said member didn't mention my name, but it was obvious it was about me. Now I feel kinda guilty and want to lock myself in my room, because I'm scared of being judged at the dining table. 

Is there a way to make gifting a habit? I'm really tired of being the guy who never gives and only receives.
