Miss my T. Just wanna talk it out
I go to therapy once a week. I had my session yesterday, but I already miss my therapist and I wish I could see her everyday. I wish she was someone else and we could have a close relationship. I know it's not possible because of ethics, I'm just fantasizing. I wish I could talk to my mom that openly but I don't even want to see my mom often. I feel kind of guilty saying this about my mom. All week long I just look forward our session. Having imaginary convos with her. She is so sweet. I understand that this might be attachment issues and other struggles which I have relating my mom. Yup, but I can't help it.

If you read that, thank you. I just wanted to talk out some of my feelings although I might seem weird but whatever;)
