Child prisoner in a 27 year old's body.
Writing this after another fit of rage where I trashed my room and beat the shit out of my own face. I'm 27, no job, no friends, no education, no romantic life, for the past 10 years ive done nothing but sit in my room and play video games and draw. I have an extremely low self esteem so I cant do anything on my own without panicking and self destructing. I don't know how to drive or do most basic adult things. I live with my dad and stepmom who baby me and will just let me sit in my room forever, I'm losing it. I have no goals or interests and no motivation. I feel like a prisoner, I've been fucked up since I was a kid and now that i'm older everyone just acts like i should have basic skills even though I didnt have a chance to develop them as a child. Any time i read about another 27 year old having multiple degrees or a job and a family I want to bash my skull into the wall until i cant feel anymore.

Those are the worse aspects of me, I'm not stupid or completely socially inept. I just hate having to interact with other people and feel like the world around me is just WRONG. I feel like a prisoner in the body of a child that died long ago
