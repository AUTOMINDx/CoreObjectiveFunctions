It’s crazy how different you’re treated after you come out.
Hey, 

So it’s my birthday today. 

My mom, sister, GF, and therapist wished me a happy birthday. Crickets from my older brother, and my old friend group. 

It’s alright. I’m sure they forgot, which is totally fine. Idk, just kinda tells me where I stand. Between Facebook and Snapchat you would think they’d be able to remember. I can’t help but compare it to last year. My text inbox was flooded, my phone was ringing off the hook. But this year? 


Silence. 


And that’s okay. I’m sure with time I’ll make new friends, maybe my other family will come around.
