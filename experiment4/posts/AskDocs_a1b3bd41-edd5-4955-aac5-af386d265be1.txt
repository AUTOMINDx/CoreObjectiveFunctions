My wife had urine colored liquid come out of her right nostril today. Any idea what it could be?
(33F) My wife bent over today and out of nowhere a bunch of fluid started coming out of her right nostril. It wasn’t snot or mucus, but more like water and yellow.

We are currently out of town for the next two weeks, but somehow managed to get an ENT appointment at the end of the day. 

The ENT numbed both nostrils and looked inside. He said he was a little nervous because in the right nostril where the fluid came out, he saw some additional fluid and couldn’t see the sinus. 

He had to suction it out and after looking again, he saw we he called a “duplicate middle turbinate”, but wasn’t very sure. He said it could be some type of sinus disease or something was “poking” through the other side causing a bulge, but wasn’t sure.

He basically didn’t know what it was and scheduled a Sinus CT without contrast. We also have a vial in case it happens again to collect fluid.

**We originally were concerned about it being CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid) but now we honestly have no idea and are a bit concerned. Does anyone know what this could be or give us some advice as we wait to get this CT of the sinus scheduled?**
