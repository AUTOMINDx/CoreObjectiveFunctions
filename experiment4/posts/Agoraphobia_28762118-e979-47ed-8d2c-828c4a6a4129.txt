I ordered at a restaurant today!!!
I went out with my aunts today to go eat and felt guilty about trying to explain how I was super uncomfortable with talking to strangers, so I just bucked up the courage and in a spur of the moment decision, I actually was able to order my food!! This is such a big win for me! :) for years now I have been unable to order my own food, pay for gas- just talk to any stranger to be honest- without panicking, stuttering, and sounding like an alien in general, so this little thing felt like climbing a mountain to me. Of course I still panicked afterward, to be expected, but Iâ€™m still so proud in myself! And good luck to everyone else in their journeys! No victory is too small :)
