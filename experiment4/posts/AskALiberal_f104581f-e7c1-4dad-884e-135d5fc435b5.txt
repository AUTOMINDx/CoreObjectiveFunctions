In light of what's going on at Kellogg
I'm all about taking down billionaires but we need to think about what's next, how do you guys feel about using unions members collective money and credit to just out right buy the means of production, so when Kellogg's starts shutting down factories either buy that factory or another. Then any new hire is able to get stock options and has full stake holder rights and the company cannot go public so the company is invested in the workers and the workers are invested in the company. What are your thoughts?
