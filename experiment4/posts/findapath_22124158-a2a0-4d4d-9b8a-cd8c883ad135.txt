Don't know what the hell I'm doing with my life.
I'm 34, living alone, working in the glorious hell that is walmart where coworkers treat me like shit and lie about me I have no idea why, all I'm there to do is my job, I have no friends, thanks to the people I work with I hate people more than I use to, I want to quit but I don't have a car, been thinking about going back to college but I don't even know for what. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.
