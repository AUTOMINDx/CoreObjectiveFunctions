What are some interesting rivalries between two or more people in world history?
Hey all, I host a podcast about historic rivalries called, fittingly, The Versus Podcast. I launched it in the Spring but was overwhelmed with college, so I put it on a pause so I can finish writing the season before airing it. This season is mostly done writing, and the theme was U.S. Rivalries. I am trying to find more possible episodes for next season, and the season is global rivalries (mainly Europe). What are some historic rivalries between individuals in global (not US) history I should consider?
