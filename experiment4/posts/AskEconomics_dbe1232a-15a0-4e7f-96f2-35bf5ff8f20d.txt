Writing Fiction: How can I plausibly make silver more valuable?
So I'm writing a novella: gold has been discovered on the moon and has flooded earth, so the value of gold comes down-- right. Now I also need the value of silver to go up and for it to become the new gold. Is it plausible to have people start to invest in it, making the value of it go up? I somehow need/want it to be linked to government issued pensions (I'm from the UK, does America have govt pensions? If not, ah well, it's set 300ish years into the future). I basically need elderly people to suddenly become super rich from the rise in silver....
