I can’t help myself from feeling angry and hatred against the world and everyone
I’ve got hatred growing inside myself, and I don’t know how to handle it. I suffer from chronic migraines since 1,5 years ago (migraines since 6 years ago) and haven’t found anything that prevents the attacks yet. In fact, it has just gotten worse for each month. 

I can’t stop thinking about how everything in life is unfair, about how no one understands me and that no one appreciates how “privileged” they are to not be in pain all the time. 

I hate that my focus has shifted from wanting to get better to this bitter hopelessness where I’m just sad and angry. I don’t want to feel like I’m a victim and turning everyone else into a target for my anger. I’m doing my best not to lash out agains my closest friends and family, because they are nothing but loving and supporting.

I just find it really hard to balance the thoughs of “it actually is really hard to be chronically sick and yes it affects my every day life” with still being at peace with yourself and the world. 

How do I stop myself from fueling this hatred and instead focus on my journey and health?
