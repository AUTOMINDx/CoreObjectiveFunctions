Thoughts on New Hampshire's new anti-CRT bill banning any teachers from advocating socialism, communism, or Marxism.

[Actual Bill](http://gencourt.state.nh.us/lsr_search/billText.aspx?id=1537&amp;type=4)

The law specifies advocacy but I suspect enforcement will not bother with the difference between covering the topic vs advocating for it.

For example, saying MLK was a good person who lead protests for civil rights of people regardless of their race, and MLK was a devout socialist is not the same as saying socialism is good, but I don't suspect proponents of the law care about the difference.

And this comes at a time when people still are nebulous in their definition of socialism. And I do not understand why capitalism is not also on the list. Heavy concentration of capital directly leads to the speedy passage of unpopular legislation and the slow if not eliminated passage of truly popular legislation.

I welcome anyone to play devil's advocate and without straw-manning add another perspective.
