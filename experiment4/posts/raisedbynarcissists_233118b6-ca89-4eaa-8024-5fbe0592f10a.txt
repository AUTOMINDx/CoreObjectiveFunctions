Anyone’s parents never let them argue as a kid? If so, how has that affected your life as an adult?
So growing up, my dad would always berate me for not getting good grades or keeping everything clean or not saving money… etc. if I ever spoke up and said anything it was “talking back” and my punishment got much worse. So I learned not to say anything and just walk away. 
I thought that was a good cop out as a kid, but now that I’m well into my 20s, I dont know how to handle disagreements. I shut down when my girlfriend’s mad at me. I’m miserable and anxious every time I go home. I just feel like the way I was raised severely limited my confidence. 

One thing I got out of it was that I’m REALLY good at shaking things off and letting go of whats bothering me which is good and bad in its own way. But damn. 

What really annoys me is I remember him always justifying his hard-ass mentality by saying “do you know what my dad would have done to me if_____” as if that wasnt 45 years ago. This attitude has pretty much killed off any desire I had to want kids and now that he’s a bit older, he’ll never make the connection that I am the way I am because he treated me like an inferior rather than his only son. 

Anyways, a bit of a rant, my bad, but ugh… Just curious if anyone else shares this sentiment
