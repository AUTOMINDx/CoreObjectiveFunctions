AITA for making my pregnant wife sleep in another room?
Before everyone makes up their judgment from the title alone please read it to its entirety. 

So my wife is 5 months pregnant. The pregnancy has been quite difficult for the both of us. She has  hyperemesis gravidarum and it is extremely stressful on her. Hence she is not able to work even part time and I have to pick up most of the slack, I work full time from 8 am to 7pm. 

For the past two months my wife has had a difficult time sleeping worsened by insomnia. There is a lot of twists and turns and getting up to go to the bathroom every few minutes. It absolutely destroys my sleep. I don't want to sound like an asshole but I have to wake up early for work and because I am a sensitive sleeper I jolt awake easy with all the sudden movements. 

I had put up with it for a month till I decided I could not deal with it anymore. I was only getting 5 hours of sleep and being in the tech industry it is super hard to function with limited sleep. I had brought this up to her mildly and respectfully and she completely understood. 

She relocated to a separate room and recently when her parents came to visit us, she had casually joked about how she sleeps in a different room. My MIL did not take this lightly and pulled me aside on why I have done this , I explained my defense and she said it is the least I could do to help her. It's not like I can actively help her anyway with her sleep problems??? We went back and forth for a while until my wife chimed in and said it is no bother and we should leave it be. 

I had a small argument with my wife after they left (for bringing it up infront of them) and I feel really guilty. We have made up, but it got me thinking if I am the asshole for really making her sleep in a separate room or if I am just looking out for my health.

***Edit 1***: I have read through most of the replies here and only some have really understood my intention.The other room my wife is sleeping in as spacious as mine. Our original room has aircon , the guest room which she sleeps in does not. She does NOT like the aircon anyway and the bed is as big maybe even bigger than our original one. It also has a toilet, I would also help her if she needs anything or has an emergency. 

***What are you going to do when the baby comes*** 
- Take shifts and plan our schedules, and I will pick up the slack where she can't and vice versa. 
-Most of the feeding is probably going to be done by her as she plans to breastfeed if she switches to formula I would happily spend time feeding my child no worries about that.

***Edit 2*** : ***Thank you for everyone who has responded I have had a lot of time to read your replies and your chats and it has helped me with perspective, I do feel guilty for the feud we had after her MIL left, I shouldn't have brought it up. We had a heart-to-heart yesterday and I discussed some of the things that you guys brought up. I apologized profusely. Also just an FYI our arguments are civil, we are never the type to raise our voices against each other. The argument with her MIL was also civil. I have called her parents up too , to apologize***

***In my OG post it was not clear that relocating was a mutual agreement. She assured me that she prefers the guest room and I would never mind giving up the main bed if that is what she prefers. However the aircon in our main room makes her nauseous hence why she prefers only the fan. Our guest bedroom has a queen size bed like our main bedroom and as kind redditors have directly messaged me I am also planning to get her a recliner for the living room***

***I also would like to apologize for poorly wording my situation. As I have said before, none of this is her fault. She is going through a really tumultuous pregnancy and I would never even be able to understand 0.0001 percent of the pain she is going through. I am beyond grateful and appreciative of everything she has done for me and our little one. She is definitely NOT slacking and I am sorry for using that term. I did not mean it in a sense that she was slacking, pregnancy is not slacking and I do not ever have that view. What I meant was that her situation meant that she required ample amounts of rest and it would render her unable to perform office duties***

  
***My sleep is something I need to work on, as many have pointed out it is going to be a concern when the baby comes. A lot of people have suggested ear plugs and sleeping gummies that helps. I will look into that. I also want everyone to know that I will completely be involved in baby's caregiving. I will ensure that my wife has sufficient time to rest especially with the aftereffects of birth.***

***I help my wife with massages and heat packs right before both of us sleep separately. I am not one to pull a tantrum when she asks for help. Ever since she got pregnant I have been the one to browse amazon for pregnancy support products (lol) both of us are very excited even amidst all the excruciating effects of HG.***

***The pregnancy is not hard for "us" but only her. I wish I can take away her pain but right now all I can is help her to the best of my ability.***

***Thank you to everyone who gave suggestions, tough/critical advice, assurance, shared their own experiences and more. I appreciate it.***

PS: ***To those suffering or who have suffered from HG  you guys are tough cookies, and best wishes to all of you***
