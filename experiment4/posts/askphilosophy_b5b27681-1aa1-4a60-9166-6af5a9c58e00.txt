Thoughts on the trolly problem when you're on the tracks?
Say you and someone simillar to you stuck on tracks and a train is coming. The train is coming to hit you. You have the choice to divert the train's path, to save your life and kill someone similar to you.

&amp;#x200B;

This person hasn't done anything to you. If you divert the train to hit them, you will be a murderer. Can you live with that guilt, or do you prefer death?

Is there a name for this type of trolly problem? What are some thoughts about ethics surrounding this situation?
