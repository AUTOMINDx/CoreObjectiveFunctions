How to deal with feeling shameful about how my trauma made me act
This year felt like literal hell. It’s over now and I’m happy it is but I’m so embarrassed about how I acted. I was living in a bug infested apartment sleeping on the floor, I couldn’t wash my hair or clothes for an embarrassing amount of time because I couldn’t afford shampoo or detergent because all of my my money was being taken by a pimp who set me up to get gang raped, would take videos without me knowing which the police ended up seeing, sold me against my will and was giving me amphetamines. I had no friends because he isolated me from them and I was constantly stressed out I went fucking insane. After he was in jail I was still living there and I would cry and scream and hit myself in the head and pull my hair out. I just wanted the images out of my fucking head and the fact that the police saw videos of me and had his phone tapped so they could hear everything that traumatized me made it so much worse. It doesn’t feel fair. I know my neighbours definitely heard me I was acting fucking insane and I’m really embarrassed about everything. How do you deal with the ptsd symptoms that embarrassed you?
