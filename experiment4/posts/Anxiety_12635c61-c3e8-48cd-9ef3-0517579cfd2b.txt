Went to a store by myself!!
I'm 17 and I've only ever been to stores with my parents or very very close friends because of my anxiety+autism. but today since my mom didn't want to go into a decently crowded store (because she's really immunocompromised right now), she dropped me off and I went in my by myself!! no one talked to me and I barely had to say anything to the cashier as well!! I'm just really happy and my parents are proud of me too :D
