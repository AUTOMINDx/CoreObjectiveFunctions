Will anything happen if I tell my therapist about my husband’s behavior?
I’m an adult and I’m married—located in the USA. I take ambien for insomnia and it has been such a blessing. It has improved my sleep and let me function more during the day. 

When I am under the influence of ambien, my husband likes to have sex and do sexual things but I have no recollection of if. If and when he references it the next day, that’s when I find out about it. It bothers me that he does this, even though I’ve told him not to do anything sexual even if I ask for it (when taking ambien). At the end of the day, I’m just glad ambien is helping me so much, the only negative is the sex I’m not aware of. I don’t want to stop taking it, so I’m not sure what to do. 

I’d like to talk this through with my therapist but don’t want to cause anything. I’m thinking since I’m an adult, it’ll be fine. I’m also wary about telling my therapist because my husband is well-liked by this individual and I don’t want to tarnish his reputation….But I wanted to know what you guys thought?
