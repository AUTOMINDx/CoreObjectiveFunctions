wtf is going on
Everything feels like a dream. Time goes by so fast and I feel paranoid and disconnected from what’s going on around me. On top of that I have harm OCD and it feels like I’m on the edge, and that I’m about to go crazy. I don’t feel safe anywhere and my harm thoughts feel so real like. It’s like I’m I have no control over myself but at the same time I do. Idek at this point, I was never like this. Anyone going thru the same?
