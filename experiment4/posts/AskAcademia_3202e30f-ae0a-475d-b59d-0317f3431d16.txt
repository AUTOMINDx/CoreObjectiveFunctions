Is this a permitted way to do research?
Hi! 

I just started my first position post-degree and I am a bit taken aback. 

I work for a prominent scholar who is very well recognized. However, is this allowed?

Essentially, as RAs we source grants/funding, complete the application and send it to the PI for approval. Then we draft contracts if we have a partner, write the research proposal, draft the questions for interviews, write the literature review, etc. We also do the ethics applications. Once she approves it all, we do the interviews, analyze the data and write the reports and again, she just approves it. Then once published, she is first author, although it doesn’t seem like shes done anything more than approve. 

We also write all her conference material, make her slides, prep her responses for speaking engagements etc. 

Is this a permissible, responsible and ethical way to do reach or does this violate ethics/academic integrity?

I just never expected to see a PI do so little. Even when things aren’t well done, she just tells us to redo it with little guidance.
