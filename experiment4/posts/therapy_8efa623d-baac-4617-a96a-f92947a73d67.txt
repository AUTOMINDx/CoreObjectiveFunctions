My brother if he can touch me and idk how to feel
Hello this incident happened I believe last month and I just need to let it out 

While me and my brother were home alone he asked me if he could touch me I was shocked, a bit scared, and discussed (note that my parents dropped us off since they were going somewhere and we both didn't want to go I was also wearing a big netted sweater and a white tanktop) I didn't realize that the tanktop was see through and could see my...(u know what) he told me if I could change and I said yes of course but he also said that I don't need to if I don't want to but I did change and even put on a sweater to cover up he was waiting outside of my room and I was gonna go do something when he asked if he could touch me I said no and he said "please" I said no again again he said "please" he even said "I'll give you 5 bucks" at that point I wanted to cry and lock myself in my parents room and call them to come home, but when I went outside to let my dogs In I saw my mom and was relieved when my mom came inside and we where alone I told her everything and practically broke down crying my mom was shocked and even angry she said "I'm so sorry sweetie I've been trying to protect you from the outside world when the enemy was right there". 

Well after that I'm not allowed to be alone with him at all and wherever my mom goes I go (side note my brother is not in the right head space as u could put it) thank you for reading.

(I might delete this later in the future)

Edit: ok wow this kinda is blowing up a bit thank you all for taking the time to reply I understand my brother needs help my family does they are taking him to go see a therapist but after the incident we just avoid and don't talk to eachother, my mother has become very religious so when the incident happened we went to church and they dropped us off so when I told her she said it was the devil trying to break up our family, I still care about my brother but ever since then I can't look at him the same my mom still asks me to call him for dinner but I still feel uncomfortable to talk to him I'm gonna talk to her and hope she understand. 

Also I have another older brother that doesn't live with us and he said once he buys a house he's gonna take our brother to live with him.
