Are dating simulator games bad to learn from?
Hi, Im 17F and have ASD. I've always sucked at knowing what to do if I haven't been taught it/experienced first hand. I have trouble with knowing what to say or how to connect with people. I have never really flirted with anyone, so I didn't know how to do it. I am very socially awkward and have low confidence and don't talk to many people because I know my social skills suck, so I try to spare everyone the uncomfortable-ness of me talking to them. I've never dated.

But a week or so ago I downloaded a dating simulator game (I feel so stupid lmao). But its really given me an insight to how those kinds of conversations, and just conversations in general, are supposed to go. (Its not a creepy one, I might be bad at social stuff, but I know when conversations aren't right/shouldn't be had.) It is a text based game, so it looks like text messages, and they seem like very possible/realistic messages. Its kinda given me a confidence boost because now I kinda know how to flirt, and how to have a nice conversation. 

But is that bad? I know that in most cases life won't play out like a game, but now I can kinda understand how it could possibly go.
