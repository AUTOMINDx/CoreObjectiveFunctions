I lied to my mom about going to school this semester.
I lied to my mom about going to school this semester and it is because I could not register for classes because I have academic probation. I have lied to her every time she asked, which is about 4 or 5 times in the last 3 months and it’s not like I’m scared she’s gonna find out on her own, I just feel like I’m doing wrong. 

The thing is that my mom will not react “normally” to finding out I’m on probation or even hearing that I’m not going to school and honestly she will freak out and assume that I’m just against anything ambitious and that I want to fail at everything in life, which isn’t necessarily true. 

I love music, and making content on my own time, I’m not really passionate about school. I’m still going back to school after my semester break, which by the way I still have time to register for classes, but my mom doesn’t believe for some reason that I went to classes this semester because she “doesn’t see me study or read” but regardless she never checks in on me anyway even when I was in classes last semester or not. Maybe she knows some other way and just doesn’t want to say anything but yeah, regardless I lied about it because I feel like she would over stress the situation and I feel like it would be wiser to just continue where I left off rather than her going crazy over it. Is this the wrong decision? What do you guys think I should do? 

Truthfully through my 4 years in community college I’ve garnered 6 credits and it would take another year to even look at a transfer but I’m not zealous toward school at ALL. I am a bad student in that aspect because I hate doing anything I’m not passionate about or see a nice future for myself for. But yeah please any advice helps. She asked again today and I damn sure wasn’t gonna tell her while family is over and on Christmas Eve, it will ruin hers and my mood for both today and tomorrow that’s for sure. Anyways all advice is appreciated.
