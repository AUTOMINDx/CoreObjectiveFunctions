“Hard days are necessary for your growth. They are lessons that will make you strong.”
I love a good motivational post / quote when I see one, but since having gone through severe trauma, reading stuff that glamorise the “hard days” of trauma as “lessons” that will “make you stronger” or “a better person” just leave a bitter taste in my mouth. 

I did not ask for growth. I did not need 100% of the hard days from my trauma to make me a stronger or better person. I did not need the traumas that I went through. They are not necessary. Rape and sexual assault, abuse, and struggling to cope with the repercussions of those instances are not “a necessary part of my journey”.

Stop. Stop this. Get the fuck out of here.
