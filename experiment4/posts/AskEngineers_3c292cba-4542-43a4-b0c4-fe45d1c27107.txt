Is ABET really that necessary?
I’m an American student currently studying mechatronics engineering in a top private university in Mexico. My goal is to work with AI / Robotics. Although my school doesn’t count with the ABET accreditation, it counts with the CACEI accreditation which is the engineering accreditor here in Mexico. I keep hearing a lot of horror stories that if isn’t ABET accredited, regardless which country you receive your degree from, it’s a worthless degree... 

I have a friend here who’s family have studied in my university and the majority of them have found jobs in Silicon Valley and within the US with no problem. I also went on the ABET website and found out that a huge majority of top European and Canadian universities don’t even have it either. Is it strictly an American thing? Is it really even that necessary?
