Partner and I seeing the same therapist
I just had a conversation with a friend that made me realize this may be very abnormal…

My partner and I see the same therapist.. I started seeing her solo about two years ago, then my partner and I had a few couples sessions with her in the last year.. and he also started seeing her individually.

I think I’m realizing that this may be considered unethical by some therapists? And I understand why, that it could invite bias and that it opens up a chance for breeching confidentiality..

I guess this just leads me to ask, should we stop doing this and find new therapists?
