Being called out on my past has been my biggest fear. It just happened.
Lately I’ve been dealing with the shame of who I used to be. Earlier this week, it just hit me all at once. Every time I was unnecessarily cruel. Every time I drank until throwing up. Every time I lied about the stupidest shit for no reason, skirted responsibility, deflected blame, engaged in manipulative behavior. 

It’s no coincidence that My lifelong depression soared to frightening heights at this time. I’m starting to understand how it’s all related, but it’s been a challenge to sort through all of these behaviors without re-experiencing the pain of that time in my life.

I’ve come a long way since then, which I think is part of what makes me so deeply ashamed of it all. The times that I’ve tried to tell people I know now about how horrible I was, they don’t even believe me, and say ‘I’m sure you couldn’t have been that bad.’ 

Today I got a message from someone I haven’t seen in 20 years, rightfully calling me out on how nasty I was. 

It’s strange that it should come at this time - when I’m processing, trying to accept and move on from my past. I’m not sure if this (horribly emotional) week puts me in a better place to deal with getting called out like this or not.

Are they still hurting from my actions after all this time? Must be to send a message like that. That’s rough. Is there anything I can do to ease their pain?

I’m just a little rattled by all of it, and I’m wondering how any of you have dealt with having to confront past behaviors.
