Knowledge of rulers in ancient times?
I was listening to the Kiffness remix of "In Praise of Genghis Khan" and looking at the background and the thought hit me - in the ancient days of travel on horseback in empires as truly massive as the above, how aware of that fact were the basic famers and men who are relatively isolated? Would they even know they were under Mongol rule geographically or would they be completely unaware? Would a lot of them even recognise such a foreign "power" so to speak?
Does anyone know? I know it's a bit of a specific question.

Thanks in advance ðŸ˜Š
