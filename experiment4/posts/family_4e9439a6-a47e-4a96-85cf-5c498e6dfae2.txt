Disappointed
So my family got together today for an early Christmas as my daughters will be spending Christmas Day with their partners families. No one asked me how I am or what have I been doing even though I asked everyone those questions in the hope they would ask me in return. If they had they would have found out that I started a new job last week. Now this is big big news for me as I’ve been looking for a job for a long time. Not only that my son also had big news to share, he has a girlfriend, and they didn’t ask him either. We both feel like outsiders in our own family and it feels like they just don’t care. Now I’m going to see how long it will take before they eventually do ask.
