Update: I got the Job!!!
I applied for a job two weeks ago and I got it. I shared the achivement of getting through the interview on this sub so I thought I might aswell share this one too.

After the first week I can say... I think I can do this. It's going pretty good and my coworkers are friendly and don't talk too much ðŸ˜‹ I feel very tired right now. I'm not used to be working anymore. Anxiety/Depression knocked me out for over a year now. I still have a long way to go but this is a biiiiiiiig step to getting my old Life back!

I wish you all the very best and happy Holidays!

edit: Thank you all! ðŸ¤—
