26 and lost in life what do i do? Am I loser?
i'm at a weird place in my life. my parents are pushing me to figure my life out and i don't know what to do with it. i'm currently in a job i despise. I graduated with a bachelors in health science with a concentration in safety and health, so this is the field i work in and i hate it. i chose it initally because before i was going to go to grad school for Physical Therapy but my thing with it was the debt and i would need to be in school for another 3 years and live with my folks. my whole house is toxic. i don't know what to choose because I always felt i was good at nothing and can do nothing because i'm not smart like my friends or sister. I never had a nack for anything i feel like. maybe its because i did not try enough or too afraid to. the only thing i know about myself is i want to live in colorado and be outdoors, be healthier, have a girlfriend &amp; have any decent job i would like. the only hobbies i enjoy is riding motorcycles, reading, working out, smoking weed, hiking, fishing &amp; playing guitar. I'm for sure nit a bad person or lazy i'm just confused because i don't feel passionate about a certain job or thing. i always found that word frustrating because many people stuck with a job they hated and i don't want to hate my life because i had to choose this. is this normal to feel this way? do i just have analysis by paralysis?
