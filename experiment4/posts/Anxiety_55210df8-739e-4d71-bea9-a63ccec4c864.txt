Is the world going to shit or am I just imagining it?
Obviously I know the news will always fear-monger and whatnot, but honestly it just seems like everything is gearing up to get even worse. Am I just going crazy? Like am I just imagining it’s terrible and things will end up being fine? 

I keep hearing about labor shortages, climate change, hyperinflation, unchecked billionaires, people in my generation being unable to obtain livable wages, no one can afford to buy houses anymore, people with degrees not finding employment.

Idk I’m 26 and In college but it’s so hard to focus on my studies with all this stress because I can never tell what’s really happening and what’s worth being stressed over.
