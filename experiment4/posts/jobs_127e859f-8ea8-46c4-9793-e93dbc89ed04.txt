I did it guys!
Finally. After hudreds of job application via LinkedIn, Indeed, etc etc... 30+ of interview session, haunted by ghost of recruiter /HR.

Laid off due to covid in early of 2021 as I works in event industry, i do lots of backbreaking &amp; low earning jobs to make end meet. 

I sell my souls working at Contact Center with long hours, unrealistic target of KPI, mismanagement of upper management and even low salary that i cant even enjoy eating outs and no weekends. 

But all have changes and will come to changes on 2022. I secure new employment that in-line with careers direction, better salary, better hours and much more prospect. 

I got the invitation of works on Wednesday and signed the offer letter today. Will start working by next week with new company. 

i am really grateful with this opportunity and I really appreciate the patience of my life partners struggling together with me. 

I also learned a lot of stuff in this subreddit and i used it in my interview and motivation.

For all those still struggling, never give up and may the future bring the best to all of us.

Long rant, sorry guys. Thanks again for listening to my Ted Talk. 

Peace out.
