Extended family began reaching out to me after a lifetime of silence, I don’t know what to think
Okay just a little background
1. My parents both died when I was 12/13. I was left in my step dad’s care after this. No other relatives reached out after the funerals as far as I know. 
2. When they were alive, my parents were divorced. My mom was very verbally and emotionally abusive. My dad was aware of this, but he didn’t fight for custody. I don’t know how much his siblings knew.
3. My step dad was also not a great parental figure. I’m not comfortable saying why, but he is currently in prison for something related to it.

So when one of my uncles on my dads side reached out today, it kind of left me panicking. Him and my aunt want to meet my sister and I. She apparently was fine with it, but I don’t know if I am in light of the lifetime of family issues we went through with our parents. I don’t know if I want to meet up or not, I’m barely comfortable with seeing my sister once or twice a year.

QUICK EDIT: My sister and I are both adults. This sudden contact is coming out of nowhere vis Facebook. I’ve had the account active since my dad was alive so any extended family could have reached me long before now.
