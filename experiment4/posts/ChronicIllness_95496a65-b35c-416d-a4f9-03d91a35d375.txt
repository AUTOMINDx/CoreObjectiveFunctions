Gift ideas for your person with a chronic illness!
I've seen a couple threads of people asking what some good gifts ideas for their loved ones with a chronic illness are so I put together a list ^_^ feel free to continue suggestions in the comments. 

-Laptop tray (like this)

-Long ice pack
Walgreens. I feel like people forget how helpful ice is! 

-Heating pads / ice packs that look like stuffies 
FYE has a ton

-Cozy socks
Dollar tree &amp; TJMAXX. I'd get a pair of grippy &amp; non-grippy if possible since preference vary

-Gift card to craft/book/hobby store 

-Yoga accessories (if they do yoga) 
Blocks, straps, yoga socks etc

-Soft throw blanket / heated blanket
Tjmaxx &amp; HomeGoods have super soft throw blankets and most are $15-20. 

-Massage therapy / acupuncture appt 
If they've never had a massage before, choose a spa that offers multiple services and just get a gift certificate and let them choose. (Don't forget to include gratuity in the certificate!)

-Matching sweatpants set, cute/sexy lounge wear or lounge wear that can double as outerwear, (lingerie if buying for your partner)
Chronic illness can take a big hit on someone's self esteem, especially if it forces you to be inside everyday and with little energy to put into your appearance. A cute outfit can make a huge difference! 

-Skin care
Single face mask packets, lotion, mani/pedicure set, foot masks, foot soak, sugar scrub, exfoliating gloves

-A foot bath (Like this)

-A "chore" coupon for deep cleaning something of their choice 

-Bath stuff 
Salts, bath bombs, bubbles, a shower headband (they're like thick towel-like headbands, 5below has some) 

-A tray to go over the tub (Like this) 
TjMaxx &amp; hobby lobby have cute ones sometimes

-If they're in a relationship you can put together a "date night" box. 
A movie night could have a movie/gift card to rent one, snacks, face masks, massage oil &amp; Pj pants. Pinterest has a ton of ideas 

-Couples can do a spa night 
Go all out with the candles, massages, shower/bathe together, cook or order in a nice dinner

-Gift card to Adam &amp; Eve
Good for singles &amp; couples. They have like wedges, and pillows that can help with the pressure of being in some positions 

-Edibles / CBD / A grinder with a handle (this actually makes a difference for me lol) 

-Tens machine
