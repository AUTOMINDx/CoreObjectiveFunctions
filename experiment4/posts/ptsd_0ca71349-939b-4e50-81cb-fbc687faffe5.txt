How did you forgive someone who shows no remorse?
I was raped by an ex boss. It's been a crazy year since. Relapsed into self-harm, addiction, major depression to the point of a suicide attempt which also caused me to lose my job. When I woke up in the hospital, I realised that he wasn't suffering as much as I did. I want to forgive him so I can move on. But he hasn't made a single attempt to reach out and he even said he "thought it was all consensual."
