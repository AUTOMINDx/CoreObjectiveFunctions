Is it normal as a new employee, I constantly have to do the outreach to my manager 100% of the time to learn things and see what things to do?
Hello all, I just started a new job on Monday and for every little thing, whether it's training, part of the onboarding process, or trying to get a new project, I have to reach out to my manager for every little item. 

I understand there are things you should take initiative on and you should try to take as much initiative as you can. But even just doing the simple "welcome aboard"/new employee housekeeping meeting I had somewhat nag her via email just to do that. I really don't want to come across as trying to nag her all the time for everything but that is basically what I am doing as she fails to reach out for everything.

She knows I started on Monday but basically acts like I'm not even here.

I know I could be overreacting but coming from a job where there was a fairly good balance of me taking some sort of initiative and where my boss actually acted like a leader and boss in taking some sort of initiative is a total change.
