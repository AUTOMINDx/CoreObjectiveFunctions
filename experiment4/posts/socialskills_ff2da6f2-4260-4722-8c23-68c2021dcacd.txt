Watching a movie alone is weird?
I have booked a ticket for watching Spider-Man: no way home movie alone. Is it bad if I watch it all alone? I don't have any friends so I thought to myself that this will be a new experience for me. Would it be weird or strange to go alone for watching a movie? 

Has anyone watched a movie alone? What was your experience like? 

I am nervous and scared but I am excited too, I don't know why but I am feeling sad too.

Edit: Hello people, thank you so much for replying and giving such wonderful answers. I went to the movie and I had the best time! ðŸ¥‚ðŸ˜º

I was feeling lonely at the start, but when I entered the theatre I had the best time! It was amazing! But I really wanted to share my opinions about the movie with someone and I had no one. :(
