Entitled parents force feed me to make their daughter feel better.
This was when I was 10 and I used to have this friend who was on the chubbier side. She wasn’t fat by any means but some people would make some nasty comments about it. Later on in our friendship she ended up gaining a lot more weight and I didn’t really care she was a nice person but whenever she’d bring it up with her parents they’d start insulting everyone to make her feel better. We went to the cinemas and her mum drove us home but on the way back we stopped at McDonald’s. My parents always had a rule of someone is offering to buy me food for free to get a cheap thing, so I only asked for a happy meal. The  friend started complaining to her mum that I was making her feel bad and she felt insecure so her mum bought me the exact same meal as her. In the nicest way possible, she was a major foodie, so when the food came there was too much so I didn’t eat it all. Her mum went ballistic at me. She started calling me a body shamer and that I was a bully and was only friends with her daughter to make her feel bad. I wasn’t skinny myself but I definitely wasn’t big. Her mum then proceeded to start shoving fries at my face and whenever I was drinking the soda she’d push it to make me drink it faster. I started choking on the food and she stopped but needless to say I never talked to her again.
