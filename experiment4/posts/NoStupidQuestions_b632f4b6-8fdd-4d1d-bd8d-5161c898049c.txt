What expenses are normal to make a 20 year old kid pay for?
my daughter hasnt had to pay for rent, insurance, cell phone.  over the last week she decided she needed a dog and despite asking her brother and I for our opinions, decided she didn't care about those and just got this dog anyway.  I obviously fucked up by not making her pay for anything and it's been really financially crippling me.  I've googled and seen pretty common moves I just want to hear from real people and their experiences

Edit: Holy cow guys! Many of you lined up with what google suggested was the norm.  Its been a roller coaster of emotions reading all of these lol.  I appreciate so many of you taking the time to submit such thoughtful and detailed responses.
