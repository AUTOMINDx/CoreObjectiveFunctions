That’s what whores do
What are things that whores do? Well according to my grandmother:

- discuss intimacy 
- use tampons
- “deal with themselves” (please don’t make me say it)
- cross their legs high (ladies only cross their ankles
- shave above the knee
- paint their nails solid colors (only French style nails allowed)

It’s so silly how nervous I’ve been about these things. The woman has been dead for 10 years and she still has control over me. Her words echo in my mind.

Well Friday, at 33, I got a manicure and painted my nails black. This is the first time I have painted them a solid color. 

Hope she’s turning over in her grave knowing that her ONLY grandchild has become a WHORE. 

Thanks for all the insecurities and self-hate you bitch. Don’t miss you at all.
