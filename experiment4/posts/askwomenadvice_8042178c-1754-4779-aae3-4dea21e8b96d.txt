Should I (19F) buzzcut / shave off my hair during half-term?
If we put the fact that it's subjective, my life, experience and environment that will influence / be influenced by my buzzcut (and maybe shouldn't be asking for advice from internet strangers!) what are your opinions?

I'm not super pretty, have quite a round and full face, and don't wear loads of makeup.

I'm pretty tired of taking care of it, will have 9ish months to grow it back (how long would that look on average?), and don't have any friends / a partner to be concerned about.

My hair is actually healthy, a bit wavy, and generally nice - it just has some thinness at the front (so I might just be uglying myself to hell this christmas, lol).

I also have minimum 3ish weeks before school starts, so at least I could adjust to it, you know?

I'm probably a bit gay, so I'm not too fussed about turning up the stereotype style if it happens to look that way, but I'm just a bit antsy.

I put it up a lot, have been tying it back in a low bun so it literally looks like I've shaved it off, and feel ok with it. 

But will it look wack? Growing it back seems shitty, and my face might not work with it *at all*.

I've also got a narcissistic mother who's really intrigued for me to get it cut, but judging from past experience, it seems more like she's anticipating me looking uglier and she's get a kick out of it.
