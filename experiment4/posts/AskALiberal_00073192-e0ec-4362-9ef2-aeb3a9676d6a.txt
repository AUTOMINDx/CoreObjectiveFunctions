Should people who knowingly expose others to COVID be criminally charged?
Question in title.


Edit: Thanks for all the responses, there are a lot of great points made in every direction. To add a little more context, what I had in mind when making this post was the allegation made by Mark Meadows that [Trump tested positive](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/01/trump-tested-positive-covid-before-biden-debate-chief-staff-mark-meadows-book?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1638338714) before meeting with Gold Star families, who he actually [suggested ](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/10/08/trump-suggests-he-may-have-contracted-coronavirus-from-gold-star-families/) may have *given* him Covid. And obviously, before the debate when the Trump team showed up too late to be tested and then took off their masks.
