Healing from trauma makes me more extraverted then I was before I started healing. I always felt I was a mix of introversion and extraversion but now I actually think that my introverted side was actually a trauma response and not my authentic self. I feel much happier being around lots of people.
Now that Iâ€™m healing more and more, I feel much more comfortable being around lots of people and I even feel comfortable being in loud environments with music playing and 20+ people being there hanging out.
I think my natural self is coming forward.
If this growth continues, maybe one day Iâ€™l feel comfortable enough to attend large dance parties.ðŸ•º
