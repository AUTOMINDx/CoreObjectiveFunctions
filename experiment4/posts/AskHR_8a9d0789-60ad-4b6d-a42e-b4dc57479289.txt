Senior employee keeps instigating drama about pay [IL] [COOK]
We have a senior employee that keeps starting rumors about new hires making 16+ when in fact they are just not true as our new hires make 13.50. How do you stop this behavior? Its uncomfortable for new employees and just rude from the senior employee whom is making significantly more anyway. He has done this before and seems to attempt it with any new hire.

Is discipline necessary? Is this protected by any legalities? How can we stop these annoying attempts to create discontent in our work environment amongst other employees?

My gut feeling is that this is considered more of an unspoken rule but legally they are allowed to talk about pay per Equal Pay Act or simply by freedom of speech but that most people do not for fear of offending people or being rude.

Again thank you for any input on this topic.
