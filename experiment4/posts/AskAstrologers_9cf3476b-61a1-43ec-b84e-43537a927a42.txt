Jupiter leaves Aquarius for good tonight depending on timezone how y’all feeling ??
So Jupiter goes back into Pisces tonight At 9:09 Pm MST which is crazy to think about that we are back to this transit I’m cautiously optimistic this time the last time this happened that was really rough but only because I was in a shitty situation and because Jupiter expands it made it worse but months and months later the situation is much better so it should be different this time 

There was some positives though like my social status increasing and gaining more support from peers but also at the same time I felt stifled by my own friend group because of toxicity and drama and also at the same dealt with the worse existential crisis I ever experienced but that may have been the Mercury Retrograde in the 9th house at the time 

Since then all these have dissolved while it’s cool that old opportunities from May-July will likely come back around I’ve learned to be more picky and choosy about it so I guess moral of the story is the second time likely will be a lot better and I’ll be able to reap the benefits much better and enjoy it I have to play Saturn because Saturn won’t be there to restrain it was basically a summer of overextending myself seems like classic Jupiter in Pisces because I wasn’t used to it at all
