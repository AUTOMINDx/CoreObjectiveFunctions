Only one human species
Okay, just to specify, there may be exceptions. I'm a wildlife biologist not an anthropologist.

So hear me out.

Apparently there are several or even dozens of human species that coexisted at the same time according to whom you ask.
These species had phenotypes that shifted over time but many overlapped with each other and even modern humans.
Get to Homo heidelbergensis and and it apparently splits into sapiens, denisovans and Neanderthals and all four "species"  with overlapping phenotypes interbred to form modern humans.
Apparently even Homo erectus interbred with other Homo sp.

So in wildlife biology we normally go by the biological definition of species. If it can breed and produce fertile offspring, that can produce fertile offspring, it is a species.

So how are these different species?
Wouldn't it be more logical to say it's just one species that shifted in phenotype over time and adapted to local conditions? Is this just a case of overzealous scientists all wanting their own Homo species?

Like tigers, black bears or wolves, we had phenotypes and adapted to local conditions and we shifted in time. But stick us together and we'll make babies. Subspecies, but not species.

Were we all Homo erectus all along?
