Need help figuring out how to solve this problem
My wife has severe tinnitus that causes insomnia. Fortunately we have a solution which is using sleep phones. Unfortunately those sleep phones use a standard audio Jack and she has an iPhone. As you might image the dongles break all the time. 

I want to buy her an MP3 player or something with an audio Jack standard but then also something that would have apps so she can download her white noise apps and audible and other such things. 

Happy to throw money at the problem, but do you know an MP3 player or similar device that both has the Jack and has native app support?

Thank you!
