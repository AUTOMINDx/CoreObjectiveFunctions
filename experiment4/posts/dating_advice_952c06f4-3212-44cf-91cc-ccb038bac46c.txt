35 white male. Released from prison 2 years ago and been clean and living legally. Please read and tell me how I can fix my issue please.
So I am 35 white male. Grew up in Brooklyn very poor. I had 5 sisters and a single mother. So I had to do a lot of things from a young age to keep my family together. Anyway I been in prison for a couple years. I been clean, sober and living legally for over 2 years now. Yet I am told I come across very confrontational, and people say I have a dangerous energy. I have not been able to have a relationship. Is there anything I can do to make sure women feel safer around me?  Thank you for any advice I really appreciate any help.
