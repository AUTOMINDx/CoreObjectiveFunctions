What is the difference about GERD and LPR (Laryngopharyngeal Reflux)?
I saw a post on Reddit someone use neck brace and his/her LPR gone. How is this possible? Bad posture causes LPR?

I'm studying computer engineering and this made sense to me. I'm sitting in front of the computer all the time.

Some Scientific Studies

Diagnosis and Treatment of Glossopharyngeal and Vagal Neuropathies in a Patient with Laryngopharyngeal Reflux

Sympathetic Nerve Entrapment Point Injection as an Antireflux Procedure for Refractory Laryngopharyngeal Reflux: A First Case Report of Innovative Autonomic Regulation

And lastly, do you think Reflux has increased since the beginning of the pandemic?  When we look at Reddit statistics, we can see that there is 
 a big increase.
