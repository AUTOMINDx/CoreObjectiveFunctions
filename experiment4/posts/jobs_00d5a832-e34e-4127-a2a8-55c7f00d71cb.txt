Got first job recently, and now it feels like I barely have any free time.
I’m a high school student and got a part time job at Walmart as a cashier 2 weeks ago. Ever since then, it feels like I’ve been having no free time. I only work 22 hours a week, but school is still considered work, so you can count that in too. Every time I get off work, I go straight to bed. I’m always tired. I have three days off(Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) every week, but like I said, I also have school + homework, so I only get a couple hours to actually do what I want, and then time flies by in those couple of hours. No more playing video games for hours, watching anime, etc. Is this what the real world is like? It would help if I actually enjoy my job, but I get butterflies in my stomach every time I get in the car to go to it because I hate it so much.
