Do other people sometimes have extremely romantic or sexual dreams about some random person you know and then wake up the next day with a subconscious infatuation with them that slowly goes away throughout the day?
This probably sounds like an oddly specific question, but this happens to me sometimes. Iâ€™m a 25-year-old male, if that really matters, in the dreams can be about pretty much any girl that I know or am even somewhat aware of. Does this happen to anyone else?
