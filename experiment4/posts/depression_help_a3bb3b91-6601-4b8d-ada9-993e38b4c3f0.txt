I feel as though I can't handle the weight of being alive.
Hi, 18/nb and finally putting my thoughts into words, sorry if it's quite chaotic. Basically, I've become almost completely apathetic about life in general, and can't get myself to do anything I want to do anymore. I feel as though every day is a struggle and that it will never get better, like I'm barely holding on, pushing forward hoping and praying for some imaginary finish line, where I can finally breathe. Looking forward it seems like life will just keep moving at the same pace and get harder and more stressful and I just can't keep up. I often have thoughts of wanting to "quit" or "give up", thinking id rather give up any possibility of a brighter future than being forced to wake up and get out of bed again.

I have been having problems with self-harm over the past year. Particularly cutting. I've become quite apathetic about it, making an excuse for myself that it's "not that serious" since I'm using a cheap blunted hobby knife that I use to make hard scratches that draw just a line of blood along the cut.

I often feel as though I am faking it all. I have a loving and accepting family, a good few friends, and a loving boyfriend. Some rough turns but I've never really been failing per se. I should be happy. But I still constantly feel like worthless trash and like everyone should or will turn their backs on me.

I keep switching between thinking that I'm fine and it's just some shit in my head to unbearable pressure in my chest that just won't come out. I haven't been able to cry, or externalise or express any of this (outside of self-harm) for over a year, it just burns and hurts in my chest and eats at my brain. I don't know what I want out of this anymore, I'm just sick of living like this and I don't know what to do.
