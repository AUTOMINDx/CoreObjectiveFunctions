PPI's Messed Me Up. Terrified Of Long Term Implications
Hey guys. I'm 27 years old. I recently went to the GI. Had stomach polyps due to the PPI and a fungal infection due to gluten intolerance which was the reason for my chronic reflux I found out. I also was critically low on B12 which the Dr said was also due to the PPI.

I've been taking PPI's (once a day) for around 2 years OTC like an idiot and stopped now after the Dr said I need to stop gluten and that's helped my reflux almost go away just in a couple weeks.

I came across studies and endless articles yesterday about PPI's causing kidney disease, cancers, bone issues. And I haven't been able to sleep. Especially since I already got several side effects from PPI's. I understand there's a lot of controversy around these studies and was hoping if someone can shed some light on the possibilities of my kidney's getting messed up or gastric cancer after daily use for 2 years.

Much appreciated.

Edit: I forgot to mention I'm a lifelong vegetarian and that my B12 was always on the lower end. But the GI was the first doctor to tell me it was critically low. So perhaps the B12 wasn't so much due to the PPI.
