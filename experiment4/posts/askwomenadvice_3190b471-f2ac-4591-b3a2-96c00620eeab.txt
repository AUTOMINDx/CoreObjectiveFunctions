How do I stop feeling the need to wear makeup in order to look attractive?
I'm a 21 year old woman in college, and I feel surrounded by beautiful women who look like they wear almost no makeup. It's made me realize how tied down to makeup I've become. I wouldn't say I wear a lot on an everyday basis (just spot concealer, makeup, and tight line eyeliner), but I've been wearing it everyday for years and I no longer appreciate what I look like without it. I'm not necessarily trying to cut it out of my life entirely, just become more comfortable without it. Any advise on embracing my natural self?
