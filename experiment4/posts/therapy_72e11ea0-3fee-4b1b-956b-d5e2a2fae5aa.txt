I tried to go to therapy again - my therapist said he couldn't help me and cut me off after 10 minutes.
I feel discouraged and don't want to try again. I appreciate the honesty and upfrontness, but it seemed kinda rude to me. Is this normal?

He said that he doesn't think individual therapy was for me and that I should try group therapy instead. I felt uncomfortable and not really wanting to tell my feelings to a group of nonprofessional strangers. I feel like my therapist didn't listen to me and just wanted to get me off his hands.
