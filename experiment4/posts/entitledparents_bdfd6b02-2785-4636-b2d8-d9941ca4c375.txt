My mom thinks she should be #1....
This one is pretty short, just wanted to say it.

My mom lives with me and my family(hubs and I pay rent and all the bills, she lives in OUR home). She drives us crazy for 1000 reasons, but this week she confirmed something I've suspected for a while.

For a while I have had the feeling that she is competing with me for my kids' love and attention, and competing with my kids for my love and attention. The thing is she isn't very nice or considerate so no one is that close with her in general, but I'm sorry my children are my #1 (husband is a close #2). I have a really good relationship with them so I am their #1 (there was talk that I might have had to go out of town for work for 6 weeks and my husband joked if the teen came with me she'd have to leave her boyfriend, she said "he can text.")


She loves to fight with them when I'm not around, so last time she got mad at my daughter that daughter doesn't tell her everything she tells me. Daughter said "but she's my mom!" My mom replied along the lines that I should be as close to her as I am to my kids and they should be as close to her as they are to me.

And to be clear, the poor relationship is because she is rude and combative with everyone in the house while simultaneously demanding that we all love and include her. We are currently at an airport where we can fly *FREE* because I work for an airline but she gives me an attitude every time I tell her to pull up her mask even though we could be denied boarding, loose my benefits or even loose my job for people not following the rules. (It's an AMAZING perk, but with big reward comes big responsibility)
