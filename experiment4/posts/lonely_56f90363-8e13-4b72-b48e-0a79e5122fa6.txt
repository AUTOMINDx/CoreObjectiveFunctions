Sometimes it just gets so hard.
[18F] I was always a fucking wallflower. Was never particularly pretty, but not ugly either. Guys always “liked me” but never actually liked me. Girls never want to hang out with me. I just feel so alienated from society and it sucks. I never had a boyfriend or a first kiss or even a best friend or anything and it’s maddening. No one wished me a happy birthday (no surprise there) and the only time ppl text me is when they want something.

I just want to disappear.

Edit: Thank you for all of your kind words!
