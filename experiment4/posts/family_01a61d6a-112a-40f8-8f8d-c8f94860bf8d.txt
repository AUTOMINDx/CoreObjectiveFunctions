Dad told me I make my mother uncomfortable.
My dad told me a few weeks ago that I make my mother feel uncomfortable and that she doesn’t know how to talk to me. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about that comment since. We’ve always been close as a family, but I’ve always felt closer to my dad than my mum, whereas my sister is closer to my mum than she is to my dad. It just feels weird that my own mother doesn’t understand me and feels uncomfortable in my presence.
