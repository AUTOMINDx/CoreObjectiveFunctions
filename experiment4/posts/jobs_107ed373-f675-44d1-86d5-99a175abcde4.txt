Hired as a graphic designer and supervisors threw me into retail store to pack mail orders.
I was hired as a graphic designer/illustrator early summer this year by UCLA. I had 8+ years of experience in photoshop, illustration, and design. There I created murals, flyers, illustrations for social media, logos, and more. 

This week they told me that ucla “ran out of money” to pay me, and said they can only pay me if I go to the retail department to pack mail orders. 

This is not the first time and I honestly felt frustrated. They “ran out of money”… yet they hired more employees and had parties during their shifts. Today I walked back to the office to eat lunch and see that they built a gingerbread house when I was in retail busting my ass and get yelled at for making mistakes in a job that I never signed up for. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. My talents and skills don’t matter in this world. Im thinking about actually doing stripping or straight up prostitution at this point, either way I’ll get treated like shit regardless of what I have, I’ll just get paid more.
