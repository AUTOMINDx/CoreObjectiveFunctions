Does anyone else get mega anxiety/guilt after a night of drinking?
I already struggle with anxiety day to day, but I swear to god, every time I drink I feel like such a piece of shit the next day (I only drink like a handful of times a year, so this isn’t an addiction problem or anything like that). And I’m not talking about having a hangover. Like all I can do is fixate on if I was embarrassing or not. Or if I seemed too silly. Or if people thought I was annoying. Like I was at a party last night, everyone was drinking and having a good time, and I wasn’t even that drunk compared to like half the people there. And I know for a fact I wasn’t mean or excessively stupid. It just sucks I can’t have fun with friends and not feel like a trash human the next day and worry about literally everything about the night. I envy people who can drink and literally not care the next day. Does anyone else experience this too? It just makes me not really want to drink ever.
