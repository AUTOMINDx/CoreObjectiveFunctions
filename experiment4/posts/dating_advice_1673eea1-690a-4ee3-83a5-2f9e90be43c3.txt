She(f21) lost interest in me(m23) out of the blue
So, i met a girl last week and we talked for some days and then we go out on the saturday and slept together till sunday, she was lovely and everything i wanted till yeasterday, in some moment she started to ghost me, and i get to talk with her only hours and hours later, and she said "i ain't in the mood to talk with you sweetheart". I asked her if i did something, and i asked for forgiveness if i did and she said something like "i have my own life my own feelings and my time" but till the other day she was saying that wanted me to be only hers and wanted to be mine i simply can't understand.

Before that fact i talked with her, and she said that she wanted to help me fight my depression and anxiety, that she would be with me and do anything to made me feel loved and to win my heart, i was fearing a little, but then when i started to show that i was really liking her and getting feelings even though that was something she wanted.

We even talked about passing the christmas and the day after together, but then she changed the plans and said that she wouldn't be able anymore to pass this weekend with me because her mom wanted her presence till sunday, i don't know if this is a bluff or something real, she said that i have what she wanted in a man, i'm sad, anxious with all those ghostings and struggling to understand what is truly happening.

Ask me anything if that can help. Thank you all for reading at least.
