Do women often feel pressured by society into saying they find particular things attractive?
So, I just saw this theory on one of the pill subreddits, saying that society puts pressure on women to say they find particular things attractive in men. (This question is mainly for cis hetero feminists, although if you have a different insight, feel free to chime in).

An example would be a woman particularly valuing tall men with visible musculature, but when asked about her preferences, choosing to say other things, which she may like, but being lower on her list of things which turn her on (for example a good sense of humour) to not come off as shallow or whatever the society wishes you to be at the place and time. Do you think there's more pressure on women to not appear as shallow? Or it's not a gendered thing?

Just to be clear, if someone says something, I always assume it's in line with how they feel and will take it at face value unless I have a good reason to think otherwise, but I just started wondering, because in this society all we say may be under the influence of how we are raised to perform our roles.

Is this a phenomenon which any of the feminists tackled or described, or is that some incel-talk rationalization? I am just wondering if there is any semblance of truth to this theory and feel like it's a right place to ask. Happy holidays y'all.
