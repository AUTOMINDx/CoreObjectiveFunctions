The girl I am dating uses a lot of abusive language towards me and in general. How do I politely bring it up since it's quite offensive?
M31 have been dating 27F. She uses the choicest of abuses when talking. She does it to her friends too but they are accustomed to it. Like she says - motherfuc*er, bastard, son of pig, son of a bitch a lot. Mostly it's in an endearing tone. So If we are kissing and I tease her a bit over something she directly calls me mother*cker. Or bastard. So to be clear we are not fighting or being rude. It's all fun. And she does it whenever I say something that makes fun of her(she's making fun of me all the time). 

She's also in the habit of calling herself "alpha woman" and refers to me as "beta". Anytime I do something which involves broad consensus like asking my mom (I do it because we have a great relationship and she likes if I involve her) if I should get a dog since she stays with me (she lost her home so I help her out, she's my mom) and would have to help in taking care of it, she calls me beta. "You are beta so it's expected of you". She says it even in front of her friends. In a mocking tone. Trying to make fun of me. 

Her friend told me to not mind it since that's just her way of flirting with me. 

It's frankly quite rude to be honest to call some mother*ucker for no reason. How do I bring it us as she has rebuffed me when I said you abuse a lot by saying "you always bitch too much about everything" 


TL;DR- girls I am seeing uses a lot of abusive words. How do I bring it up politely
