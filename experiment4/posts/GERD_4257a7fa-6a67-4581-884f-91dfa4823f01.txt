GERD is one hell of a reality check for me
I had symptoms of GERD since age 16- got diagnosed at 19. And lately the symptoms been flaring up again really bad because my diet is beyond poor. Beforehand, I was morbidly obese. I am now at a healthy weight. But my love for fatty foods and chocolate and coffee. Instead of a balanced meal, I will eat chocolate as a meal- drink coffee- and snack on fatty foods like pizza rolls. Mostly it was the same chocolate foods.

I really can't keep that up and have to change. Flare ups gotten so bad it was hard to even lay down. Doctor prescribed pepcid again, been taking that.

Im almost kinda glad its painful? Kinda?? Not exactly?? Its just that if this doesnt slow me down, other worst health issue would come up and fuck me over. Tbh i wish food in general didnt cause health issues. Im such a comfort eater and very repetitive. The pain gets so bad.
