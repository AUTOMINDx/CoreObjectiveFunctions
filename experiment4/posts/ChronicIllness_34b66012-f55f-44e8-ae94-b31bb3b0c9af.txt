Does anyone else have doctor underwear or am I just weird?
So, I’ve been in random situations over the years ie the dermatologist where I wasn’t aware that I was going to have to take my clothes off. Now I know doctors couldn’t give less of a shit about what underwear I’m wearing but it made me self conscious sitting there in a gown with some pretty tiny underwear on. Since then, even to doctors I’m 99% sure I’ll be able to keep my clothes on, I have underwear I prefer to wear. Told my friend this yesterday and she looked at me and said well never would’ve thought of it but I guess it makes sense. It made her laugh. Wondered if it’s just a me thing
