When it all changed
My mom put a box of pictures on the table today. We went through them and it made me wonder, when did the happiness stop ? 

The pictures stopped as soon as I was no longer a toddler. I was five in the last one. Did it change then ? 

The bedtime kisses stopped as soon as I was no longer a child. I was ten and I just entered a new school in a city I didn't recognize. Was I already too old for that ? 

The house emptied and the shared meals stopped as soon as I was no longer a teenager. I was seventeen and I remember all too well when dad said he had found love. Mom didn't cry, she always hated the whining. We didn't go to my favourite restaurant to celebrate my graduation after all. Did starting college really made me an adult ? 

I can't remember when the " I love you"s stopped but I can remember when they started. I was twenty and I think I read it once in a text. Is it so hard to say ? It does feel weird for me too. 

The house is sold and I stopped feeling sad about no longer having a place to call home. I'm turning 21 at Christmas. We all drank coffee together today in my stepfather's garden. Dad put out my cigarette, mom almost laughed. I used to be the one telling them to quit.
