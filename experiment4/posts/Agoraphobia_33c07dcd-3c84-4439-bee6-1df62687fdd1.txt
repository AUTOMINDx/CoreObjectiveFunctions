How do you date as an agoraphobe?
I've been single for 2 years now, before that I was engaged to a guy for 9 years so dating hasn't really happened since I developed agoraphobia 6 years ago. I'm so tired of being alone because I struggle to leave my house.. I'm so lonely and isolated all the time. I've always put dating off because I wouldn't even know where to start? I have so much to offer and I'm so tired of not being able to love someone and feel it back ðŸ˜¢
