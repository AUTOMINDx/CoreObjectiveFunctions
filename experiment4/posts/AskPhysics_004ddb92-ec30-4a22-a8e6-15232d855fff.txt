Seeking advice on failing quantum mechanics!
Hello, I'm currently a 3rd year at a US University-- taking my second semester of quantum mechanics. I am currently failing the class. I feel like I am alone in struggling with the class, most people that I have talked to in the physics department say quantum mechanics is one of the more approachable courses. I struggle in the mathematics notation and the book we use (Griffiths) is difficult for me to digest. Any advice to start improving the next time I take it? Feeling kind of dumb and incompetent in physics.  


  
For reference the way I studied for the class is:

&amp;#x200B;

1. read the book (sometimes before lecture but most of the time a day after lecture) + some note taking
2. Look at HW problems first then review the necessary information I need. This is the part I get stuck in because I don't feel confident to start on the problems even after reviewing the notes. For reference, I did decently well in Mechanics/E&amp;M with these techniques but perhaps there is a better way to approach QM  


TLDR: I suck at quantum and I feel like I'm the only one :(

Thanks everyone :)
