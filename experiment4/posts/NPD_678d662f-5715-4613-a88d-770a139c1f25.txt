How to take off the mask?
Kind of tweaking right now because I’m almost certain I have mix of BPD/NPD. Not sure where I stand on the spectrum, but I definitely have traits of both. 

I want to get better and learn how to empathize with people if there’s even a sliver of a chance that I can get there. Imo, the first step seems to be learning who the “true me” is. How do I get there? How do I start to really understand who the true me is?
