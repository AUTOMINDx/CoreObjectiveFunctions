What high paying jobs can I get with no college degree?
I am currently studying economics, which is useless. My GPA is a 2.8 due to depression and I might not be able to get my dream job. I am thinking about leaving college for a while or getting a job while completing college. I am in my third year of college and I want to get enough money to survive and live by myself and pay my rent. I have about $40k in student loan debt. I am willing to try anything at the moment. I am looking for a starting salary of $50k to $70k and I am willing to work my way up to $100k+ if possible. I just want financial stability. What are some jobs that I can get? I live in the east coast if that helps. If anyone would suggest trades, is there anything that's respected in society and that's not too hard on the body? I have low back pain and got into an accident that messed up my left ankle, which makes it hard to walk.
