This disease takes away everything that makes living worthwhile
Massive flare up last few days.

Currently have a burning throat from acid/sick/regurgitation or whatever is sitting there. Dozens of spasms in chest. Bloating and gas. Stomach pains. And skipped heart beats (PVCs) all night every night. I'm still unsure if my shoulder and arm and hand pain is related to GERD too. I'm sleeping bad and I wonder if it's this waking me up 10 times a night. The only relief during a flare up is a long hard belch that releases some discomfort before it builds up again. Where is this gas coming from?!

I've not even overdone it the last few days. I'm losing weight every week because I'm not eating nearly as much as I use to. Everything seems to trigger this. I know our mantra is eat small portions often in the day but there's no practicality to that. I feel like I'm not getting enough food and nutrients inside me but at the same time if I eat more I'll just feel worst.

Drinking, eating, exercise, sleep, socialising, relaxing, travel, sex, everything is made near impossible to enjoy by this thing. PPI's didn't work well enough for me to take them for the rest of my life. Endoscopy was clear. Appointments to see specialists are months apart because this thing isn't seen as a priority.

I really don't want to go back on the PPIs. Want to beat this naturally but it's an impossible game.

EDIT: Downvote without explanation from someone is just plain strange but I've come to expect it from Reddit
