It’s insane how fake socialising is
When you really think about the rules for socialising it’s fucking mind blowing. 

It’s a scripted performance but worse because it becomes natural even though it’s artificial. 

It’s built into language. Good morning, how are you, what have you been doing.

Our conversations/ relationships are pre packaged and that’s just the basic shit but it goes deeper, the way we talk about work, bitch about each other, talk about our love life.

Even life advice is always the exact same copy pasted bullshit that’s completely impersonal but still is a genuine attempt to console you because people are just walking internet hard drives, even on this sub the advice will always be the same.

95% of conversations are bullshit. The rest only happen with people you know extremely well, most of those are arguments or talking about your favourite films. 

I just can’t do it. I feel like such a dick when I talk like a normal person because it’s so fake in my brain it’s acting and I’m not a good actor. 

I can’t talk to people and I’ll never have any friends. Even if there are people like me in the world who I could maybe be friends with, they’re also locked behind the wall of bullshit small talk and that’s the only way to meet people and I can’t do it. 

People are fucking morons and life is bullshit I hate everything I’m sad and lonely I hope I find a nice work/ drug addiction balance in life to be happy one day in my lonely sad life.
