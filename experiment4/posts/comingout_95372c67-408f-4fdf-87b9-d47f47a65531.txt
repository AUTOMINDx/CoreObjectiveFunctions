Thinking of making a podcast
I’m thinking of making a queer podcast, what topics would you guys like to hear about?

Gonna post this in other subreddits so if you see this more than once, my bad :)

I’ve been through some bad stuff early, and as I head off to college Ive been reflecting a lot. Naturally, I’m gonna make a podcast on it haha. So what are some topics you’d like to hear?

I plan on sharing my coming and stuff,  ur I’m sure there are other things to talk about too.
