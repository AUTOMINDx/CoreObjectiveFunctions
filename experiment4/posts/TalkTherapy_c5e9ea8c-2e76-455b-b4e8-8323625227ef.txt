My therapist brings up politics all the time.
Last night in my court ordered group therapy alcohol class, my therapist asked if I had any stressors. I said money was kind of something, especially because my gas has gone up from 30 for a tank to 50. He was like “oh yeah thank joe Biden for that”. And I responded that I wasn’t going to thank him for anything. He was like “oh yeah you’re on that side” then proceeded to put his hand over his mouth and went “go joe Biden” (mocking me at this point). I responded with “I don’t know I’m not on either side.” And he kept going with “it doesn’t matter which side you’re on, it’s joe Biden’s fault for our cost of living going up.”

At this point it was kind of tense and I just looked at him and said “okay.” He finally moved on but it just really rubbed me the wrong way. I think therapy should be a safe place without people getting attacked, especially by the person leading the group. I was very passive because I wasn’t about to fight about something I didn’t have any interest in. But even if I did support Biden, it’s a terrible message he’s sending that people can’t express what they believe in. He does this a lot in our groups, he brings up politics all the time. And at this point idk how to respond when he does it. I find it embarrassing on his part. So I would like advice on how to possibly respond or deal with this in the future.
