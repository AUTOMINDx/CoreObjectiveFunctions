Why is being boring bad?
Recently a girl I really liked said behind my back that I was boring. People have commented that my dating profile appears boring which is causing me to get no matches. But tbh I don't see any issue with the way I'm living right now. I'm just doing activities that bring me joy. The activities that bring me joy are TV, youtube, food, news, gym, and reddit. Every now and then I'll go traveling or go on camping trip but it's kind of expensive. To the average girl this seems boring but I don't see any issue.

Even my job is perceived as boring to other people. It's a stable government job. I have a business that I work on the side a lot but it's very technical and most people don't understand

So why do most men have to present themselves as interesting when most of us live pretty boring lives? Why is there this constant need to be interesting?

I just feel like the world needs more boring stable people right now with all the chaos.
