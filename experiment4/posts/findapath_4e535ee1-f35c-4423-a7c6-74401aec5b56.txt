An alternative for those who do not want a career
Since my comment in another thread got quite a few upvotes, I thought I would try to give something back to the community.

I never really wanted a career. I think having to work sucks. I would rather spend my time enjoying nature, relaxing with friends or playing video games. Nevertheless, I can't change the system and I like food and a warm home, so I have to earn money.

After trying to build passive income businesses and startups, I realized that those are even more work than being an employee. So I decided to become a freelancer.

**Right now I'm a freelance UX/UI designer and work remotely about 15-20h per week. This covers my living expenses** and leaves some money over to save up. I won't get rich doing it, and my friends who work full-time probably make more than me. But I like this life far more than working full-time.

So for those who might not want to work 40 hour weeks for something they don't give a flying f about, I want to provide this potential option that works for me and might work for you.

The best part? You can do whatever you want with the rest of your life. Go build that passion project. Go hike that mountain. Doesn't matter. Because when you have something that pays the bills, the other stuff in your life doesn't have to make money.

**So what does this option looks like?**

* **Learn a skill** that is in demand on the market and well-paid. If you want location-indepence, the skill should be digital, as that would give you the option to work remotely. The Covid-19 pandemic has made this a lot easier.
* **Build a portfolio.** You have to be able to convince potential clients that you can fulfill their requirements before they hire you.
* **Sell that skill as a freelancer** to companies. You could sell your skills to private people, but they usually don't have money. Small to medium sized companies work best. Large companies, in my experience, usually hire agencies.
* **Reduce your expenses.** Every euro you don't spend is something you don't have to spend time earning.

**A few skills that are in demand right now:**

* Software
   * UX/UI Design
   * Software Development
   * Website Development
* Marketing
   * Video Editing / Motion Graphics
   * Marketing Stategy
   * Content creation
   * Copywriting
* Analytics / Data Science
* and many more..

If you want to take this path, know that it is not easy, but very much worth it. You will have to learn the skill itself, but also basics of accounting, selling to clients, negotiating and a whole lot of personal development.

I hope this is helpful to some of you. If you have any questions, let me know!
