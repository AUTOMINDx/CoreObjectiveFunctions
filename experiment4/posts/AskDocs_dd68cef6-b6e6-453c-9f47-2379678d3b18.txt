I was accidentally left on Cortef for a year &amp; am seriously lacking answers.
F25 5’7” 155lbs Anxiety disorder/Bipolar 2, Lithium, Promethazine, fish oil for dry eye (Being monitored by an ophthalmologist)

When I was 20 I was prescribed Cortef for adrenal fatigue. A year later my nurse practitioner realized it was only supposed to be 3 months. She panicked, so did my doctor, &amp;amp; the med company.

During this time my eyes became so dry &amp;amp; blurred I was using eye drops 6 times a day. Now at 25 I have dry eye &amp;amp; use them 2-3 times a day. 

Severe dry eyes were blown off as a coincidence, but how can that be??

I also previously had a flat stomach and now have a lower abdominal “pooch” which my doctor said is a fat deposit. Never went away. 

Also, prescribed Cortef at 20, diagnosed Bipolar at 21.

Any thoughts on this? Particularly the dry eye? The company was extremely concerned, but no one could give me an answer as to the effects it truly caused.

Edit to clarify: I was weaned off the steroids after a year
