Common phrases and their influence on critical thinking
The power of phrases and common sayings

Not sure if this is the right sub to ask. I’m interested in reading on the power that everyday sayings or cultural phrases have on our ability to think critically about a subject or in manipulating a population.

Most cultures have sayings about their people or where they live, the weather, etc and use these as a way of summarising quickly the collective knowledge on the subject. I’m wondering if this process actually hinders critical thought when the circumstances change.

For example, if there is a saying about a country’s weather, that is no longer applicable due to climate change, but the people of that country still use the saying, does that work as a form of unconscious manipulation on their thoughts about the weather?
