Neighbour hung themselves. Now I am struggling with suicidal thoughts too.
I'm struggling and need to talk. This is really awful, dark stuff - so please don't read if you're not in the headspace to do so. I also want to say that while I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts, I'm safe and I have a good support system.

Last year on January 7th someone in the building across from me hung themselves. I think maybe they cut themselves before they did it, so there was blood down the side of the building for a week or so. Some people in PPE eventually went and cleaned it up on a cherrypicker. I've been working from home all alone, so I look out onto this building 24 hours a day. You can see it very clearly from my bedroom/office. 

Then in the summer, I was walking across a bridge. In my city, the bridge is notorious for suicides. They have positive quotes written into the concrete and a lot of suicide hotline phones. I was crossing and I saw a man standing looking down. I didn't think anything of it. A few minutes later the bridge is blocked off and police are sprinting past me. I look behind me and the man is gone - presumably jumped to his death. 

Depression has always been an issue for me, but right now it's unbearable. I have suicidal thoughts every day, multiple times a day. I'm okay - I don't feel like I am going to hurt myself, but the thoughts are constant. I just want them to go away. I'm scared to start medication because I'm worried it'll make the thoughts worse. Never been on antidepressants apart from a short trial of Celexa... do they help? 

I know it's been almost a year since that person hung themselves, but it's still so hard. I think about it every day. I wonder if the people in my life think I'm too sensitive. I don't know. Thank you to the health care workers and paramedics who deal with this stuff every day. I don't know how you folks do it, but I am appreciative and I am thinking of you all.
