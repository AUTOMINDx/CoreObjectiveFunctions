Is it ethical for my generation (20M) to have children?
Given climate change and the impending doom it brings with it. Climate change is an issue, that's an undeniable fact. Governments around the world are doing the bare minimum to combat this issue. 

I'm Australian, our prime minister's response to climate change has been pathetic. This is terryfing, humanity is fucked if we don't solve this.

Is it ethical to bring a child into this? The environment is going to be hostile, water shortages are going to be an issue. 

On an individual level, there is not much we can do.

I don't believe it's ethical to bring a child into this place.

What do you think?
