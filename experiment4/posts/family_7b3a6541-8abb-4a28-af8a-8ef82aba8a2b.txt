For those of you with your familys intact.
Especially this time of the year, be grateful you have your loved ones still here. Tomorrows never guaranteed. Dont let small petty things get in the way. I lost my dad on December 23rd of 2016. It still hurts not having him here, I miss him so much. He was the leader of our pack and demonstrated to me what a should be and the extent that you may need to go sometimes for your family. My wife lost her cousin whom she was very close with as well the day after my dad passed. So to say this time of the year is rough for us is an understatement. We have a 13 month old little girl who is the best thing thats ever happened to us both and seeing her happy makes everything my dad did for me growing up make sense. I know youre not here with us physically dad but I know youre around. You'd love your granddaughter shes picking up things so fast and is already running around. Anyways, sorry for the rant everyone. But I have one ask if you are arguing about something small and petty with a loved one, let it go. Appreciate the time you have with them. Happy holidays.
