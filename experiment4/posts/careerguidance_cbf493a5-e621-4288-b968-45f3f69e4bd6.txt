Being asked to leave company after almost 10 years. Do I fight this or is asking an employee to leave appropriate?
I’ve been with my current (large, known) company for almost 10 years now as a manager. With recent shifts in upper management it’s been a difficult to find a way to prove my worth to my director as nothing has been good for her and I feel as though she’s put me in a negative light since she was hired. I’ve taken on more projects and completed them successfully as she has asked, but it still hasn’t been enough. She has hired a lot of her friends into technical management roles (like mine) from her previous job at a restaurant with no experience in this field so I’ve also had to train them. 

To now: I have been asked to leave. They’ve have brought up missing 8 out of 150 audit inspections and those were on days I was on PTO, new employee on-boarding and temporary/contract employee to full-time conversion delays when that’s an HR responsibility. I’ve never had issues with other managers/directors since I’ve been employed here. I’m not sure if I should even bother fighting this at this point since my director clearly does not like me and I feel as though they’ve had it out for me since they started. Should I fight this as I’ve been here for so long or is it even appropriate to ask me to quit?
