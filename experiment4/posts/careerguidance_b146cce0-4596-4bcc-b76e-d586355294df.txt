Exit Interview Question: What can we do to make you stay?
My exit interview is for a few hours and I asked my boss to give me her questions ahead of time because I didn't want to be caught off guard and I wanted to give meaningful answers. One of her questions is, "what could we have done to make you stay" and I really don't know how to answer that without saying "better pay, less micromanaging, giving me more credit for my work, not talking like I am an idiot. I ain't no dummy, I was born at night, not last night!"

Edit: I said nothing but good things. Boss was really happy and she asked me to give her a hug. What a crazy change of events
