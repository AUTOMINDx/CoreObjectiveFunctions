Does it bother anyone else that people say “drugs and alcohol” as if alcohol isn’t a drug
It’s so weird to me how normalized drinking is, even excessive drinking is pretty accepted depending on the circumstance (college for example) 

I think calling a spade a spade, so alcohol a drug might get people to take it more seriously. I’m not saying people shouldn’t drink but it’s always weird to me how people brush over alcoholism, ESPECIALLY functioning alcoholics. 

I had a DARE program type thing and they focused more on the “dangers” of weed than alcohol, what a joke
