What do you think about the "equal but different" argument?
For context, you're arguing about gender equality and someone tells you men are, let's say, more logical and women are emotional. Which is why men have better mathematical skills. But he also states women and men are equal but different.
Why does your bs radar go off?
Also, since this is a recurring argument, if any of you know any feminists (Judith Butler, Andrea Dworkins, etc.) who have commented on the "equal but different" argument, leave thier works below.

I know it has something to do with how all women's work tends to be seem as lesser value than "masculine" jobs, but I'd like more detailed answers.
