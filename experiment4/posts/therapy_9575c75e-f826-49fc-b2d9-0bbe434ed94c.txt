I’m not actively suicidal just indifferent towards living
The title pretty much says it all. I’m not always considering killing myself but I don’t particularly care about being or staying alive. Because of this I generally get suicidal at the drop of a hat. Is this normal for depression or is it something else? Is this normal at all? I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar idk if that has something to do with it. I also don’t really know why I’m posting this I just feel like I need to say something and hope that someone can give me advice that could help in any way. Thanks in advance
