Need help remembering how to cosplay as a functional adult for a job interview
Hello all, I'll try to keep this short. The past 2 years have done a number on my mental health. I know I'm not even close to being the only one, but between getting temp laid off during 2020 and then needing surgery I have been out of a regular job for awhile. So now it's time to get back on the horse of capitalism, I used to be a workaholic even though I constantly struggled with my agoraphobia pre-pandemic. However today when I answered the phone (a terrifying thing for me to do these days) to schedule a zoom interview I felt like I was about to pass out from pure fear. I have a few days to mentally prepare but I can't help but feel immense guilt and shame for this mental prison I'm trying to break out of. I'm terrified I'll freeze and start tripping over my words.  I guess my question is, for any of you out there that slid backwards mentally during these two years what's your secret to getting back out there? Did you watch or read something that helped you? Thank you in advance.
