Hungry ghosts
So how do you deal with feeling insatiable all the time? Is there a way out for us out of this vicious circle? Are you familiar with the term? It’s supposed to originate from Native American lore where the hungry ghosts are deemed to forever scour the Earth looking to consume everything and everyone, never having peace. Gabor Mate also has used it to denote traumatized persons in his work.

Like I hate this part of myself where I will start looking at another girl as the way out even if my current relationship is not bad. It’s like boredom in combination with a rebellious nature, like self-sabotaging and doing things to undermine any goodness in my life is what I’m after. And wanting to own, to leave a mark, to taint. It’s like I know I am able to create a magnetic impulse for a certain kind of girl, an empath, a sacrificer, a saver etc…it’s the energy that gets put out there. And vice versa…I’m able to read that quite easily by gathering information.

But what the fuck is the use if am not really there at all. It’s all very abstract but it’s this coasting through life thing, where nothing phases me. Am so distant and detached from everything so nothing would phase me….Although if I relinquished control over my surroundings I’d probably feel very unstable, fearful etc. Like I had a panic attack when my gf left for a couple of weeks and I had a confrontation with some asshole driver. Like deep down am a fearful child but I portray an invulnerable beast of a man.
