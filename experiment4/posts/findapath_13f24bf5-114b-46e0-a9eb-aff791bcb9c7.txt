“I just want a job that makes a lot of money”
Is it wrong to have this mindset? I know what I’m good at in terms of skills, and I know what my experience is, but when it comes to networking, everyone always just asks “what kind of job are you looking for?”. I always just want to respond with my answer, but it just seems so wrong. It’s almost as if we are supposed to know what we want to do for a job. I put myself in a lot of debt in college, after everyone made it seem like you can get internships junior and senior year and then get a job in tech, or a job in marketing(my field of study). Junior/Senior year I couldn’t get anything for internships and thus when I graduated from university here in the US I started working for Trader Joe’s. Even working there everyone asked what I want to do.
