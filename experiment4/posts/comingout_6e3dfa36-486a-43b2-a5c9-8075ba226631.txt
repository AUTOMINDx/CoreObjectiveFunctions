My Gay Christian Dad
I just wanted to share my story about my gay dad. Maybe there will be people who can relate to it and feel seen in their experiences. 

My dad came out as gay to me when I was 17 years old. I had suspected he might be bisexual before but wasn't sure. 
He grew up in an abusive family and found father figures in the YMCA-Scouts. However, that was also where he came into contact with fundamentalist evangelical views. He was convinced he had to go to therapy and that the only acceptable way to live as a gay Christian man is in celibacy or get healed or whatever.

Anyways, when he was 35 years old he met my mother, they liked each other and he told her from the beginning about his sexuality. She said: "If it is in God's will it will work." So they got married. He had a lot of doubts, he never stopped feeling attracted to men but they went through with it.

And here I am, I came out to my parents as gay half a year after my dad came out to me, when I was 17 years old. In the meantime my parents have become more liberal in their faith. They say they wouldn't recommend anybody to do the same thing they did. Nonetheless, my mum says she'd do everything exactly the same way again. My dad thinks a lot about what could have been with his life if he had gotten more support in his life with being gay though. 

Does anybody here have similar experiences?
