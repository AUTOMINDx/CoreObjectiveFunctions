My dad
By god i hate myself. Me and my father like to sit down in our garage, have a drink or two. We talk. We have fun. He is a bit older you know (63), and sometimes i feel he doesnt know his limit. He's kinda drunk and gets tired. I was just outside calling a cab for myself and suddenly i hear him falling on his knees. He's fine, the tiredness just caught up with him. Brought him upstairs so he goes to bed. But i feel i somehow forced him to stay with me because he loves talking with me since we didnt quite have the chance to do so a few years ago. I told him several times to go upstairs if he's tired. But he just refused saying he enjoys the conversations so much. I think sometimes i should just stop and make him go to bed (dunno how to say it without sounding weird). I just want him to be save and not exceed his limits. :/
