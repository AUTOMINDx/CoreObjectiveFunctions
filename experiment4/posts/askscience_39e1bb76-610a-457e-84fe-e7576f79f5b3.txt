Did every person with red hair come from the same mutated person, or did the mutation happen multiple times?
I first posted this in r/askhistorians hoping for a sort of time line, but it was removed for being a science question. I am no expert but I'd appreciate any insight someone could give here! 

I was reading that the people in England originate from the same group as the Celts. But the Celts have a higher percentage of red hair. But the red hair gene I thought originated 30 000 + years ago in Asia. So was it that one person in Asia who's descendents ended up being Celts but somehow not English? Or did the mutation happen again independently of being passed down from them? 

Thank you!

Edit: thank you for all the replies. I'm really happy that so many people are curious about this as well. I apologize for generalizing and referring to the Irish and Scottish as 'Celts'. The Celts are a diverse group not limited to that region!
