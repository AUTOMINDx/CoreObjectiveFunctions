I told my mother to never contact me again
I posted a week or so ago that my mother wanted to reconnect.  No apology.  No taking responsibility for her drinking.  Yet she has the nerve to judge me and call me a bad mom over and over (I'm a great mom because I learned what not to do from her).  When I posted last time I received a few replies that it was ok to cut contact and I think I really needed to hear that.  I asked for an apology and for her to take responsibility.  I got the apology.  That's all.  
       I dated a man she didn't approve of.  So she had to put her judgment out there when she would have never said that kind of thing to my brother.  So basically she told me if she didn't approve of the guy I was going to marry, then she would never acknowledge him.  Huh???  So my mother comes over to my house and my husband has to leave because she doesn't approve?  I told her that's not the mother I deserve or want in my life.  Where does she get off saying this stuff when she wrecked at least 3 cars when I was growing up and was drunk all the damn time?....and she still drinks!!!!   She said I would rather not be exposed to your personal choices.   Yet I didn't have a fucking choice but to be exposed to her choices in my childhood.  What a hypocrite!  
      It's heart breaking and I really tried to have a relationship with her but this is the fifth time we have been not speaking and the last three times I've been a poor role model for my kids.  The absolute nerve of this lady.  It's unbelievable.
