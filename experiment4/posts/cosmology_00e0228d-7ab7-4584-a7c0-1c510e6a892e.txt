If the universe ended in heat death and is infinite how could all energy ever be evenly spread?
If energy can’t be destroyed would its final state be as radiation in space? Then would it just keep spreading further apart throughout the infinite universe, forever tending towards zero? 

I’m having a hard time grasping this. If I bounce a ball on the ground once, or clap my hands where will that kinetic energy be after heat death? What about the matter that made up the ball? 

Thank you!
