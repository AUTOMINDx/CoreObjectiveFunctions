I just need to vent
I have been a child of an alcoholic for 22 years and you’d think that by now I would be used to this shit… I am mostly numb to it.  but having my daughter unearthed a whole new level of hurt and a whole different understanding and perspective on exactly how my parents failed me and the consequences of that. 

I am so fucking sick and tired of having a mother who will continue to side with a person who is literally shitface drunk over her own daughter. My entire childhood she told me that my fathers drinking was my fault and I grew up thinking that I caused this. She told me that as a toddler. 

This is in no way shape or form the “worst” of what I have to deal with on a daily basis but I’m just irritated right now.

Since having my daughter 9 months ago I have lost 25 pounds out of pure stress. I don’t eat because I work full time and if I have free time - I try to use it to spend time with my daughter or catch up on things… I also think I’m trying to punish myself by not allowing myself to eat.. long story..

Regardless I’ve finally been feeling a bit better and I cooked a whole breakfast this morning and enjoyed it. Tonight I wanted to cook chili for dinner - again, first time I’ve cooked or even had any appetite at all in MONTHS. 

My baby is sick - sick enough that we spent this evening at the ER (she’s okay now). So I had to bathe her, make her bottle, put her to sleep to comfort her. 

Meanwhile my fucking alcoholic father is screaming at me telling me to hurry the fuck up and cook his dinner. 

And my mother takes his side and tells me how ungreatful I am.


I just can’t anymore. I should have given up a long long time ago on ever trying to get my mom to love me. Somehow I still keep believing one day she will understand how much she’s hurt me.

My whole purpose in life now is to be stability, comfort, and sanity for my daughter that I desperately needed and never had from either parent or any relative.
