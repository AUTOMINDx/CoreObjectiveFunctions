Why do people like to point out when I “seem to be doing better.”
Maybe I just get easily irritated when healthy people comment on my health, but this person I know likes to always comment, “You seem to be doing better.” It upsets me because the reason I left my house to spend time with someone is because I’ve weighed the consequences and felt like the activity would be worth it. 

It’s exhausting having to explain to people that just because I look fine one day doesn’t mean I’ll be fine the next or in the future or even in that moment. 

This person has also said very ignorant, hurtful things in the past. They didn’t know, but at the same time I feel like they should have known better. *(Asked if I was certain my physical condition wasn’t due to a psychiatric reason. Asked if I’ve tried x, y, and/or z. Etc.)* 

So whenever people make a comment like that I just don’t respond and let them finish their sentence or answer themselves. 

When my friend made that comment I didn’t respond and he followed it with, “I mean. I’m sure it still hurts, but at least you’re doing better.” I got cynical and petty and replied with, “I’m not and I won’t be.” And that was the end of that. 

Does anyone else ever get a little irritated when people say similar stuff, or am I just experiencing a pet peeve?
