I lost my cat
My cat ran away yesterday and we were searching for her all night. I found her at one point in our back yard but when I reached down for her she ran away again. I’ve searched every inch of our back yard and some of the surrounding area. It’s so cold over here and she’s a indoor cat. I know she’s so cold and scared. I’ve looked everywhere for her but i can’t find her. If I just would’ve grabbed her faster yesterday when I saw her she would be home safe. I miss her so much I don’t know what to do. I feel sick.
