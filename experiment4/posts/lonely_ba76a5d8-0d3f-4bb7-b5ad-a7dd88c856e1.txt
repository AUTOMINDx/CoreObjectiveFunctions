My day should be a happy day because it’s my birthday but I just realized no one gives a shit about me
I was so happy when I left my house and when I arrived to school no one ever remembered my birthday and my close friends didn’t even bother to send me a birthday message like I always do for them!
I feel so empty in my own birthday it sucks I feel like all my energy was drained and I can’t be happy today 
I am checking my messages every minute hopping that someone would remind of me and it’s empty
it’s fucking empty
people that I talk to on a daily basis and knew today was birthday didn’t even care
it feels like I have no friends 
even people online wished me a happy birthday
I guess is very fun to turn 17
