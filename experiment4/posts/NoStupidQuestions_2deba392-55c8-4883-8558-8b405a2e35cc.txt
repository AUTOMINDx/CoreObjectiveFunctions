My roommate lit a white candle in a jar of salt in front of my door, what could this mean?
It's exactly as it sounds and I'm sorry I do not have a picture as she has since cleaned up. 

I woke up to a lit white candle in every window sill in the house and one in front of each of our rooms. 

The candle was slender, white, and in a glass bottle of white salt. 

From what anime and horror movies have taught me salt is an ingredient for keeping away spirits or something so I'm thinking it could be that but I'd like to read specifically on this particular ritual and I'm unable to find anything on Google. 

Is she protecting the house or something? Could a Wiccan possibly chime in?
