Misleading job posted by company.
I want to share and ask for your opinion.

A few months ago, I had an interview with a service company that posted an ad looking for Field Engineer. 

After the interview, I got the job and resigned from my current job.

After I arrived at the company a few months later. They explain to me that I will be working as a Junior Technician because I don't have experience. Not only a technical but a junior technician. 

I have no other choice but to accept it because I already resigned from my previous job.

I am now bonded to the company for a few years due to contract.

What's your advice for me?
