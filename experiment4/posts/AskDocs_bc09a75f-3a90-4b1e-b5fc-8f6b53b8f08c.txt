I didn't get any good answers from this sub, and was concerned enough about myself that I called my doctor, and she sent me to get some blood tests (she must have known something was wrong because it is NOT fun getting medical care in Cleveland right now).

I had one of the lowest vitamin D levels "she had ever seen." Additionally, I had fairly low B12 and iron. Like I mentioned in the original post, I have Crohn's Disease, but seem to be mostly in remission. I haven't been able to get a colonoscopy in quite some time due to the pandemic since here at Cleveland Clinic everything is on an urgent basis, but I might need to get one soon, because it seems vitamins aren't absorbing right despite me taken a myriad of daily vitamins and eating well. 

Hopefully this helps someone else with the same symptoms! Winter is not a great time for vitamin D levels.
