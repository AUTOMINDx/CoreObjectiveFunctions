I've always had a passion for Physics and Mathematics, but I feel like my passion faded away.
Hello everyone I am a high school student currently in Grade 11. I've loved physics since I was in Grade 10. You know the story I was inspired to learn physics because I love looking at the world around me and observing its intricate nature blah blah blah. I'm even thinking of applying to university to learn Mathematics and Physics since my school isn't really the best and doesn't really help me improve in anything, I even read (past tense) books about physics and even started self-study for Maths from the very start, but that didn't work out due to my laziness. When I started Grade 11 this year I slowly started to lose interest in Maths and Physics, even though I feel really bad about it, and I think it's really been affecting my everyday life. I would do anything to regain that passion again. Having said that, any advice would be appreciated, and thanks if you read all the way through.
