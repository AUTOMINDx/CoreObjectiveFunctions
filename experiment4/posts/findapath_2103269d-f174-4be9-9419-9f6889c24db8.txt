I dropped out of University. Now what?
I dropped out because of financial and health issues (social anxiety...). I wanted to make money but it is hard for me go out there and get a job. 

Now without showing my face, the only chance I have is online. I am an intelligent guy(21). I enjoy making stuff (notebooks, drawings and stuff) and can learn skill very fast. (I am interested in making leather goods)

My goal is to move to some western country but I do realize that it's hard af. So I want to start a business. 

Any advice for me on how I can navigate through this situation?
