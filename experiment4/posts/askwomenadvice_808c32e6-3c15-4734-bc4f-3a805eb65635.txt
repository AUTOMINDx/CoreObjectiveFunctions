My ex says she will kill herself. She blames me. I don’t know how to help.
My ex (22f) and I(20m) were together for 2 years. We got together when I was 18 and she was 20. We have been broken up for a few months now. She said it was because she felt like she deserves to be treated better than the way I was treating her. I always tried my best to be a good person to her. When she told me that I said I wish her the best and I hope she can find someone that treats her the way she deserves. I didn’t want to make her feel guilty and I do truly wish her happiness. I let her know that I will always be in her corner and I will always try to help. It seemed for a while like she was doing better and that was great. Then this past weekend she said she was going on a camping trip as she always loved nature and she finished finals and wanted to relax on her own. Then tonight she tells me she got back and she is cutting herself. At first she said she was not suicidal and I tried to calm her down and let her know I’m here for her. I’m not a therapist and she does have one, I know I can’t fix anything but I was trying to make her feel like she’s not alone. I didn’t get angry or upset with her, I also took special care to make sure I wasn’t making her feel like she let me or anyone down by self harming as I know that can make it worse. Then she says she’s decided she needs to kill herself. She tells me it’s because she’s alone and forgotten by everyone including me. I don’t know what to do. I know she is terrified of mental institutions and I don’t know how much help telling the police is either. I want to make sure she’s ok. But as a community college student I really don’t have any resources and my ability to offer any sort of real life help aside from being there and being a shoulder to cry on is extremely limited.

Edit:
Today she is going to see her therapist and says she will do whatever her therapist thinks is best.
