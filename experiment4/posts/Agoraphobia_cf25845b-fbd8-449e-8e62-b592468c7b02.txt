Do I have agoraphobia? I struggle relaxing in public places when I know I can’t escape easily.
When I leave home for the restaurant I don’t like to be too far from home by myself. When I wait for my food at the restaurant it makes me anxious, but when I’m done and I know I can leave at any time I feel super great.

My worst moment is normally when I board a plane and sit down in my seat. Knowing that I can’t escape easily for x hours has been long to come by. I booked business seat last time and I still felt similar symptoms.

As soon as my brain is busy or distracted by someone else, I get very little symptoms. As soon as the pilot mention that we are about to land in 45 mins, my symptoms completely goes away for 2 days.

Anyone can relate?
