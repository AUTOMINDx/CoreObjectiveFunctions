Husband's mom euthanized cat for easier Christmas
I am still a bit shocked, but I found out last night that my husband's mom euthanized her kitty. Apparently they were very worried. It started acting out and they were scared she was going to attack people. Not even a few days ago she posted online that it had been one year since adopting the kitten. I know they are expecting people over for Christmas.  The thing is... they have an entire basement suite that is her office/home business. It's just two of them and (was) two cats. It's a large house. I did notice the animal does have anxiety but.... death!? Because 6 people are coming over. 

Normally I would rant to my mother about this. But when I was 15 she euthanized my cat for peeing in the house. The cat was 10 and she said because  it was so old it only knew a life with us and should be put down. I came home one day and the furniture was tossed aside, no cat. My mother tells me that the vet didn't want to do it, but with lots of convincing put the cat down. So I guess I have some unresolved issues. Anyway, this should be an interesting family dinner. :o
