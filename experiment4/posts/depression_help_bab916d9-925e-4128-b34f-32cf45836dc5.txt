Does anybody else struggle with *feeling* ??
I don’t know how to describe it, I simply don’t feel anything. I can’t tell if I’m sad or tired, I just can’t pinpoint any emotions. It’s almost like I’m just watching myself exist. My therapist said that maybe I couldn’t feel because I was too tired to feel anything at all. Maybe it’s because I attribute physical feeling to emotional feeling; I know I’m sad when my chest hurts and it’s hard to breathe etc. Idk does this happen to anyone else?
