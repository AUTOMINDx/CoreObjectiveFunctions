My social skills deteriorate as I get comfortable with someone
When I meet someone new that I want to impress, I’m very good at managing the emotional state of the conversation, focusing on building rapport, and ultimately make the interaction playful, interesting, and intimate. I think this is what’s called superficial charm.

Once I’ve built enough intimacy that we’re comfortable around each other, I no longer have the intrinsic motivation to sustain all those behaviours. My emotional intelligence drops, focusing mostly on how I feel, and ignoring how my words and actions affect the emotional state of the other person. I guess this is what’s called narcissism; I got a supply through superficial charm and then im milking it to make myself feel good as long as it lasts.

I tried an experiment, which was to consciously elevate the person I’m interacting with back to someone I want to impress, and the charm came back again. I started making the other person laugh more, become more relaxed and playful, and manage their emotions so that they feel really good. I’m thinking of moving forward with this model. I think it’s a bit manipulative, but then again the intentions are good; I want to keep up good relationships with others long term, not just in the first couple months of meeting them.

I wonder if anyone else has similar experiences and can help me out. My goal is to maintain good long term relationships.
