A little bit of encouragement, because don’t we all need it every now and then?
Having a rough day? Wanna smoke a joint really bad? Go clean your kitchen! Tempted to break your 25 day streak of not watching porn? Try to learn that difficult section of that guitar solo that you’ve been trying to nail for the past few days! Really craving a sugary drink? Eat a banana! Wanna just sit on the couch all day and binge watch a show you’ve seen 1000 times already? Go for a walk and use that $500 camera that’s been collecting dust. Putting off that paper that’s due tomorrow because you would rather just go to the bar and get shitfaced on a Tuesday night because you’re okay with turning it in late and getting a C instead of an A? Just finish it! You only have 1 page left!

Okay, that last one is a bit specific because that’s the kind of student I was in college lol. Regardless, being productive or doing something good for yourself feels so much better than temporary gratification. If you fail don’t feel bad for yourself. It’s okay, we’re only human. Everyone fails but everyone is also capable of winning and everyone loves an underdog story. Flip the script and prove the doubters wrong. Just remember, there are over 780,000 people on this subreddit that believe in you and support you trying to become the best person you can possibly be. Don’t give up!
