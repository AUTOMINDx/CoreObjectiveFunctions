Going through some intense mourning. Need some hope and support.
I’ve known I’ve had cPTSD for a few years but attributed only to an abusive marriage. 4 months ago I really came out of denial and now I see how much my parents hurt me. I feel like I’m never going to stop grieving and getting angry. It’s also really through me into depression, dissociation and anxiety cycles and making it so so hard to function. 

Can anyone offer support or tell me it gets better after it gets worse?
