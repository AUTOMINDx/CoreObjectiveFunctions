Do you ever have the urge to tell someone everything that was done to you?
Idk sometimes I get overwhelmed by this feeling of wanting someone to know my story.

I think my brain wants the abuse to be validated.

Or I want someone to tell me it was awful.

My parents abused the shit out of me and then gaslit me into oblivion. I was the bad guy everything that they did was my fault. 

I would try and tell them that what they were doing was wrong and abuse. They would never listen and it was always turned back on me and why I deserved it and why I was actually the abusive one- the f****** child. 

I don't know I want my story to matter. I want someone to know how much happened. Why I'm so f***** up.
