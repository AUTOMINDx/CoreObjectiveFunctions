Not getting diagnosed cause i am AWARE i have npd?
My psychologist (just like the ones came before her) thinks i have “narcissistic traits” but won’t diagnose me because i am aware of it. According to her pwNPD can’t and won’t admit they have npd or they hate themselves (she said so cause we were talking about self-love and i told her i don’t actually love myself). I wrote down the dsm-v criteria for npd and if it applied, i circled them and wrote why i relate. Even though i fit the criteria she still won’t diagnose me because i am self-aware. What the hell? I am looking for advice whether or not I should find another psychologist, if I don’t what do I tell her about not diagnosing me. Also i am genuinely confused about what i can’t be self aware.
