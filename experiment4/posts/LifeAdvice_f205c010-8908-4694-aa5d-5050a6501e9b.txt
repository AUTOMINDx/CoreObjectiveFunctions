19 year old feeling lost.
I am a 19 year old, somewhat anti social, with extremely low self confidence.  I feel a little bit isolated, which is enjoyable occasionaly.  I was sexually abused earlier this year which reminded me of childhood "trauma" (even though I hate that word). That combined with my parents health issues i went into a downward spiral of destructive thoughts and behavior that lasted many months.  I never spoke to anyone about anything. Now that I am resurfacing (from the spiral) and feeling like I want to actually grow and live again (barely), I feel really overwhelmed, anxious and lost. Im trying to think positevely, but its really hard alot of the time thinking I have no assets and nothing to do outside of school (which im  off for a month). And no close relationships or sense of inner guidance at this point. I have a few hobbies but other then that just really empty. I waste so much time on dumb apps and it makes me feel sick and disgusted.  What should I do with myself?
