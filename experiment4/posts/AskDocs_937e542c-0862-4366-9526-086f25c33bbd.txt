Can I raise a complaint and how?
1st time I see a new gynecologist and was advised to “watch my weight and not eat refried beans and tacos, lots of salads”. I am a 1st generation Mexican American but I can’t remember the last time I ate beans or tacos. She never asked me what my diet actually consists of nor did she look into my original concerns that brought me to the appointment. She asked a few questions about my medical history but if I was off by a few months about things I experienced almost 7 years ago she questioned my intellect and sanity. She would say matter of fact your chart says otherwise. If she has my chart why ask and then shame me for making a mistake recalling the info? Can I raise a complaint against her? I haven’t gone back.
