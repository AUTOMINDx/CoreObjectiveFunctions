Why is there higher inflation in the U.S.?
First time posting here. I saw a map on another sub that showed rates of inflation in the U.S. and EU countries throughout 2020-2021. France, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, and the Scandinavian countries had relatively lower inflation. What economic conditions or policies have led to this difference in inflation? Or is the difference negligible?
