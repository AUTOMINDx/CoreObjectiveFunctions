is psychology "distinct from neurology" becoming obsolete as an academic discipline?
Hi everyone, 

I am reading *Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature* and came across the following remark in a footnote: "The disappearance of psychology as a discipline distinct from neurology, and similar cultural developments, might eventually free us from the image of the Mirror of Nature much more effectively than philosophers' identity theories." 

The book came out in 1979. I got curious about what has become of psychology as an academic discipline in US universities. I guess it is undergoing changes, faster and ever faster? Under the pressure of advances (developments) in neuro-sciences? 

Has psychology as an academic discipline become more a "science" than a humanities (or humanistic social science) discipline? everywhere?

What we call "moral psychology" -- is it  something that will not be taught, not be mentioned, in Psychology departments?
