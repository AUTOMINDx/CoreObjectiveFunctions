This is the first time I open up publicly about my molestation
Well I’m a 21m and when I was around 10 I’d say, tbh its just vivid in my mind but my sisters ex boyfriend would abuse me and touch me and it went on for a while I just know it was from elementary until like the 6th grade and my sister changed she has a family with a new guy but deep down inside I still hate her bc she would verbally bully me my whole life and treat me like shyt also she would watch and just allow him to do these vile things to me and recently I just been thinking about it since life’s been pretty rough I’m a dude and I’ve been kinda hyper sexual but I try not to be but I think it’s like a side effect from it not sure Inwant to talk to a therapist but I feel like they get paid to listen so it’s not real idk 🤷‍♂️ just wish I had someone to talk to
