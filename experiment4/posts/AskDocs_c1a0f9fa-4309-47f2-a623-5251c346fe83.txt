3 Year Old Suddenly Doesn’t Want To Eat Solid Foods
3M, 44.8 Lbs.  My three-year-old son is very large for his age, 99th percentile height and weight.  He has always been a very healthy eater, but about three weeks ago he abruptly stopped eating altogether.  We can get him to take milk, water, drinkable yogurt, and juice, but we have to blend other things like soup to feed him with a syringe.  He takes it, doesn’t vomit or have other problems with it, normal bowel movement.

His pediatrician thought three weeks ago that he had a stomach virus, which makes sense. The pediatrician prescribed zofran at the time.  But the sudden refusal to eat solid foods is odd. He used to love to eat crackers, bread, and all sorts of fruit. Now he won’t eat.

A peculiar behavior he’s also exhibiting is that when he does try, he sticks out his tongue and wipes it with his hand (seemingly) to get the flavor off. This happens with any bread or cracker or even French fries. It doesn’t seem to be general nausea because he does take liquid or blended foods. 

Any ideas what this could be? Is it normal for a three year olds food preferences to change that drastically after being ill?

Thanks to all for any suggestions!
