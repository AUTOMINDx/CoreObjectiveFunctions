How to make your Parents suspect that you're gay?
Okay, so. I wanna try to make my dad know im gay before i tell him. So when i actually come out to him, he already knows and will say "i knew it" and then im good... Or is that a bad idea? I really wanna come out to him, so that I'm finally outed in my whole house. That would be great, I'd be able to bring a boyfriend or a date home and everybody knows it, no surprises. Because of this, lately I'm really hoping to get a Boyfriend, and this makes me want to come out even more. My mom knows it but she refuses to tell my dad, so i gotta do the work... She says that i should finally do it so often, but theres my other problem: Im kinda uncomfortable being gay in her presence, like talking about my problems and stuff. She says she got no problem with it but my sister told me that my mom asked her a lot about it back then like "is it just a phase?" "i cant believe that..." and so on, doesnt help me accepting who i am and talking about gay stuff in her presence...   


I know my problem is kinda basic but i cant figure out how to do it, so if any of u could help that would mean a lot to me!
