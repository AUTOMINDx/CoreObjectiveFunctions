Metoo- excuses
My gf is a med student and today the doctor said to her and her co-student that they can examine each other’s abdomen with ultrasound to train using ultrasound. 

They would have been alone, her with a male student.

The male student declined to do that and when pushed further said that he did not want to risk being accused of “something”- he also mentioned the metoo-movement. 

Is it sexist of him to not want to train US with a female student?

EDIT: perhaps important additional info: that examination would include him undressing his shirt and my gf to undress to her bra
