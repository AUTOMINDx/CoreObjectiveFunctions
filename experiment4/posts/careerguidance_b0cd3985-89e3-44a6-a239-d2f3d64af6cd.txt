I (23F) am tired of studying medicine. I want to change to an animal based career. Are there any careers that combine human and vet med?
I am in my final year of medicine, and although I'm good at it, I've never had a passion for human medicine. Only 3 subjects have piqued my interest in the past 6 years. I've always wanted to become a veterinarian and work with animals in some way, but now it's too late to back out of medicine, and I don't want the last 6 years to go to waste. In addition to that, vet school is another 5 years, and I don't have the money to pay for vet tuition right now. Is there any way a doctor for humans can work with animals?

P.S. I'm currently studying medicine in Europe, and would like to work in the UK.
