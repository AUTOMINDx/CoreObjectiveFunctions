Lack of self since started working with boundaries
It’s been an intense year of therapy and baby steps toward healing. Setting up healthy boundaries has been a big basic skill that I realized that I never really learned. For example with some older friends, as my therapy progressed, I’ve become very aware of toxic atmospheres and communication styles. Weird usage of words, putting each other down, just trying to be ”fun” in a way that’s just not nice.

Earlier I would have laughed it off or lowered myself to the same level, but no longer. I don’t find it funny, I don’t enjoy it, it just spreads negativity. I find myself being very reserved with some people - and when a weird comment comes I’m like - what the heck did he/she just say? Either I stayed quiet and reflected over the comment, or by answering ”no” or ”that’s not how I look at it”.

I feel like a bore. But I also realize, I'm not. I should probably find some new friends.

I should be happy. I am. I am happy. I’ve come really far from where I used to be and I try to be aware of this. I just can’t… seem to find who I am anymore? If you don’t take bullshit, what do you take? Where’s the limit? What’s a healthy relationship? Where does the limits go with what you can joke about? What’s a kind hearted joke and what’s a mean one? What's sharing? What's oversharing? How do normal people connect? Who am I? ….. It’s frightening and at the same time it’s kind of exciting.

While I’m happy I’ve gotten this far I’m trying not go become bitter of the realization that I’m many years below my peers when it comes to normal, healthy relationships and conversations.

I’m afraid I’ve lost my sense of humor, my sense of self. What did I gain? My sense of worth.
