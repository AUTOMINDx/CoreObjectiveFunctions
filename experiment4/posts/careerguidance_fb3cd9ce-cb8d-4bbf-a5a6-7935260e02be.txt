What are some things to say when an employer takes you for a tour of the premises after an interview ?
I always find it very awkward in the sense that your meeting a lot of new people and they always give you those judgey eyes when walking through.

I have a interview lined up that i really dont want to screw up.

Im a bit socially awkward and don’t want to respond with things like : “thats nice” “i like that “

Sorry if this is a stupid question.
