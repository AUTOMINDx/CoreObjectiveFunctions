Conflict with my husband, he won't allow unvaccinated family members to meet our daughter
I am writing here because I am desperate. The pandemic, and also many other non-related to pandemic factors but a maszive strain on our marriage and I dont know how much longer I can continue.
We used to be the best couple for over 8 years, then kid, then pandemic and health related issues.
The pandemic has been a massive conflict point. We live in the country of my husband and because of it i have barely seen my family during the last 2 years. This is not his fault but his lack of support and empathy and general attitude of "it's how it is, deal with it" is killing me inside.
Traveling to home is not only expensive but a massive stress and worry to not catch covid there or on the way.
But above all now he says he won't allow the wife of my brother anywhere near our daughter, even if she tests.
The wife won't get the shot ever, she is reluctant.
I understand his worry and the rational argument, but I don't understand the lack of common sense and the lack of desire to find a solution (testing). He says: be mad at her, not me, and I know rationally he is right, and she won't lift a finger to under our situation. But it is burning inside, this feeling of him being so insanely rigid about this and drawing this line in the family.
I guess ny question is - has anyone experienced this? Is it "normal"? Is it excusable? I know he is technically "right" but I simply cant get over his complete lack of understanding on how this affects me and the family.
Advice? (Talking to him and explaining doesn't help)
