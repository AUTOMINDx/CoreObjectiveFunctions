I had a flashback at school and the school got mad at me for it :/
(TW: SA)

A little over six months ago I was r*ped at knifepoint, and a bit after that I was diagnosed with ptsd due to things like having flashbacks, insomnia, and more frequent panic attacks etc

The other day I had a flashback in school and it was pretty bad, after being guided to the medical room I eventually calmed down a bit and the nurse asked what was wrong (the school were aware of what happened to me) and I explained that I had PTSD and I had a flashback caused by something someone said in class,
She then proceeded to tell me how I shouldn’t be making fun of veterans and that you can’t have ptsd if you didn’t go to war,, she then told me to stop wasting school time and go to class, which I did.

The whole situation just made me mad though, schools always talk about how they care about mental health but as soon as there’s a mental illness they don’t have the time or energy to care

Edit:
I’ve read through a lot of the comments, and wanted to thank everyone for the support I’ve gotten with this.
I think I’ll definitely be reporting her, not sure what will come of it but I’ll give an update if anything changes
