My wife has gained a lot of weight recently, and is now upset about not being able to find new clothes that fit. Need advice on how to help her with the clothes situation
For context 3 years ago she was slim and sporty, we've had two children since then and also have also been inactive during covid. Two kids have made things really really hard, and as a result things like eating well have gone out the window, she's put on a lot of weight. Regardless I'm supportive of her and love her the same as ever.

Recently she came home in tears, after going to a few clothes shops to try and buy some bits nothing fit or looked good, she also found some shops simply didn't go that large.

We're from the UK, she's 5ft 2, and has hit 90kg (198 lb), shes come all the way up from 60ish kg (132 lb). So she is short and currently big.

In regards to weight loss, we're working on it, we're trying to make lots of small sustainable changes to our habits, and I have got her a personal trainer once a week. We're working on it. But it's going to be a long tough slog with two kids I think.

Is there anything I can do here to help with the clothes situation? Maybe something I could do as a Christmas present? I know this is a really broad question but I appreciate any advice, clothing and fashion is foreign topic to me. I'd love to make her feel better about things while she works on herself.
