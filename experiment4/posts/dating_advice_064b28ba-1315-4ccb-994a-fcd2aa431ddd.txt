Been told twice in a row that there “wasn’t a spark” after the first date
I (24m) don’t go on many dates, and a lot of the ones I do go on aren’t very good. But the last two good dates I’ve had were very similar stories. Met on Hinge, texted for over a week very frequently, met up for dinner or coffee, had a great time just chatting about each others’ lives, and then get a text the next day:

“I think you’re a super kind, sweet guy, but I just didn’t feel the connection I’m looking for.”

I appreciate the decency and honesty up front, but after multiple rounds of this same story, it stings. I’m of the opinion that you usually aren’t sure of that connection/“spark” right away, and I think one date is a bit soon to tell for sure. Am I wrong here? I want to be respectful, and I obviously can’t force how someone feels, but I’m tired of first date after first date with the same result.

EDIT: I see that the “you’re too ugly/not funny enough/too short” troll crowd has arrived, so I’m ignoring the comments from here on out. Thanks to everyone that gave kind reassurances or genuine advice. And to the misogynists who like to generalize and demean all women, a very special fuck you to you. Treat women with respect. It’s not hard.
