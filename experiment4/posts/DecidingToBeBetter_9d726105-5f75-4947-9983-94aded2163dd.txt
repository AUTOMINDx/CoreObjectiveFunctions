I had a conversation with a girl stranger for the first time..!
I am a guy and I am someone who's never been social and always awkward when it comes to social interactions. I mostly avoid talking to people even friends I've known for a long time. My go to escape conversation method is plug headphones in and listen to music. I have talked to strangers before but it wasn't a conversation. Something like telling time, which station is approaching etc. And even if I did have any convo, it'd be with elderly guys in their 60s. Somehow I just find myself comfortable talking to them.
Yesterday while traveling by train, I find this girl really cute and she was wearing this ted x shirt. Apparently she was volunteering. It really got me curious. And after contemplating for 20 minutes about talking to her. I just got up and went for it..! We talked and I got a great deal to know about how ted x works and where do I volunteer etc. Then my anxiety took over and I ended the conversation and went my way home. I am just so happy and I took that step and had an amazing conversation with her..!
