Does the expansion of the universe imply it is moving in a 4th spatial dimension?
I'm not very well versed in cosmology. Has this explanation of expansion been considered before?

Edit:

Just to elaborate on the origin of my question to clarify what I'm talking about, when you move a 3D object of varying width, lets say a cone, through a 2D plane, if you move it through in the increasing direction, in the 2D space it will appear as an expanding circle.

The same can be said of moving a 4D object through 3D space. 

But in my question, the object would be space time itself I guess.
