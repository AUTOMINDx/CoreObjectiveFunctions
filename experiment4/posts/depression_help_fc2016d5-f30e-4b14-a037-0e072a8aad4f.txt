Anyone who feels they got over depression. I would really like to ask some questions
It's a bit hard to describe, I've been dealing with depression for a long time. I dont remember not having it, I dont know if I still have it. I've had therapy for about 2 years now. For me it's not helped that much. A bit at the start but it's not done much after the first bit.

I'd love to have a chat with someone who feels like they got over it. I dont know what to do with my feelings rn. I feel like it might help to speek to someone who got out of it.
