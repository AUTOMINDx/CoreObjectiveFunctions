Wearing a scarf/shawl/turban on one shoulder?
A bit of an obscure question, but I’ve seen various cultures where men wear a scarf/turban/shawl but have it rest on one shoulder.

I was first exposed to it in my culture, [Somali](https://images.app.goo.gl/LzToozW1AE8F8iJfA). Then noticed it in nearby cultures, [Yemen](https://images.app.goo.gl/trYbB2Ti3rexmtzV9) and Ethiopia. Which made sense to me. But then I started noticing it across the world. I’ve seen it in [Colombia](https://images.app.goo.gl/8GE7RpP45dC3CQ5u5), and more recently in a vlog in SE Asia.

How did all these different cultures develop an inutile accessory to their clothes? It doesn’t really warm you up. They don’t use it to wipe their hands. Did they all coincidentally develop it from regular scarf/shawl wearing?

Edit: Here’s another example of a [British-Somali wearing it](https://images.app.goo.gl/9nfzvvfF51Youw6c9). Very similar (thin white scarf) to the Colombian example. You can find both thick and thin scarves. And you can find both loosely thrown on and neatly folded.
