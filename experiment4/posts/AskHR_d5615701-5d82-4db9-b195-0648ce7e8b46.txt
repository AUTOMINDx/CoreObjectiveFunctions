[NJ] my boss had sex with a coworker in same room as me while i was sleeping
my boss had sex with a coworker in the same room as me

I work and live in NJ and i went on a work retreat where we were asked to share our hotel rooms with another employee. i got stuck sharing a room with my direct supervisor. 

During the night she let a coworker into our room while i was sleeping, without asking me if it was ok. they then proceeded to have sex in the same room as me in the next bed. they assumed i was sleeping but i heard everything

The next morning i got up to find him naked in the bed and she tried to lie to me saying he tried to have sex with her but she kept saying no. but i heard everything. 

I am unsure what i should do. i feel very uncomfortable and uneasy. how should i go about handling this? will she get fired?

Edit: i Just wanted to update everyone. i wrote up my side of the story and reported it to HR. she is denying she did anything with him and HR told me that it’s a hard case because basically there’s two people against me. i return to work today, thankfully i work remote, however i work very closely with her in constant communication. i’m really upset with how’s things have been going so far.
