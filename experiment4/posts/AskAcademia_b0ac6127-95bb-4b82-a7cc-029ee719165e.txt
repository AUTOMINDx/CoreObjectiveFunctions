Unexpected institutions are downloading my MA thesis…why?
So I submitted my MA thesis in August to my former institution’s open access digital repository. Since then I’ve had 36 downloads from around the world, which blows my mind. I didn’t expect it to get any downloads. I actually kinda hoped no one would read it, because you always look back at your writing and wonder what people are gonna think!

Some downloads have been from universities, which is understandable…

But I got some commercial and government downloads! It’s freaking me out!

One download is from a chemical industry company in TX, another is from a telephone company in Prague, an internet company in Brazil, an internet company in Oklahoma, and two downloads from the state of North Dakota. What!!??? Plus a number of unaffiliated individuals across the country. 

My thesis was about conservation, capitalism, and zoos. I don’t get it. Is this real? Why would the state of North Dakota, a chemical company, a phone company, and internet companies want my thesis?? 😭😭😭

I’m already embarrassed as it is. I wish I knew what I signed up for, having my name out there like that. It’s embarrassing. I never thought people would actually download it. In a few years I’m gonna look at my MA thesis and think “ew how could I have written that??” Now I don’t want to publish anything, ever….why am I in a PhD program? 😅😅😅

I’m just…embarrassed. I put myself out there for the world. And now random companies are downloading it. It feels weird. It can’t be right.

Also I don’t have a common name, so I don’t even know how they found my thesis 🤣🤣🤣
