TW: Childhood Abuse. This is Embarrassing but I Need Help Showering
Hey all,  


I have PTSD and I have a very hard time taking a shower.  All of my senses get overloaded, I feel vulnerable, I pretty much can't deal.  Additionally, I sometimes have flashbacks in the shower and just don't feel safe.  


But I'm sick of being someone who only showers every week.  I can't go on like this.  Does anyone have any advice for me on how I can overcome this challenge?
