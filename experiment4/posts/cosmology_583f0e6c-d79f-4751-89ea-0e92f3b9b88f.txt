In this video

the author says spacetime falls into the center of the BH at a rate that exceeds lights ability to escape.  

1) How far out from a non-spinning BH does spacetime flow (fall) into a BH?

2) What is the speed/rate that it falls towards the event horizon, and once past the event horizon the center?

3) What happens to this concentrated space time that has fallen into a BH?

4) Any other videos that cover this you would recommend?
