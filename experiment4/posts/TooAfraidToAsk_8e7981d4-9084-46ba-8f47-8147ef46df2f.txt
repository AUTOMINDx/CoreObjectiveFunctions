I am the most undisciplined person. I don't brush my teeth everyday, I can't get myself to workout, I am overweight, I can't sit and focus on one kind of work by myself. How do I get myself together and really start doing?
"Today is the last day I be this way."
I tell myself every single day. I watched hundreds of videos on how to fix myself, for years now. I even got to a decent level of weight before the pandemic hit and put me back to where I was. Now I'm just stuck. How do people do it? 

How do you always sleep and wake in time?
Always brush your teeth?
Always shower?
Always workout and eat healthy?
Always be in time for work?
Be able to work on yourself and be disciplined and motivated everyday?

I'm a mess. I really am. Help me fix myself, please. What is wrong with me?
