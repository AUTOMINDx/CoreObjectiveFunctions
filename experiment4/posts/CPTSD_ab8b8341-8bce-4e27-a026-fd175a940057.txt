How do I cut off my little sister who is toxic. We were both adopted she’s my only blood/biological family I have ever known. I have taken care of her since she was a baby. Our birth mom left us to die, if it weren’t for me taking care of her… feeding her she might not be here. I bonded to her as a motherly figure since she was born. 

We were adopted into an extremely abusive family who picked me as the scapegoat. 
My little sister has been so used to seeing me abused she joins in. 
I love her. I don’t wanna leave her to those abusive people but I’m scared that she is just like them. 
She’s only 21 years old and just had a baby (5 months) and is pregnant again. I don’t wanna leave her and my niece/nephews. I can’t take the abuse tho. She is still in contact daily with our “dad” who molested/sexually abused me until now !!! I’m 22. The whole family knew and forced me to keep it a secret and my little sister still loves them. Still talks to them. Still goes over for Christmas , etc. she goes over there and not even to see me who is so suicidal everyday. I just can’t take this
