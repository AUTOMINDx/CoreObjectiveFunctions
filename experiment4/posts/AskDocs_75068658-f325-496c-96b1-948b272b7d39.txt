Wife ICU after anaesthesia. Urgent help for possible outcome?
My wife was performing (25f, 167cm, skinny, from Middle East) an IVF and was needed to be asleep during the operation to ‘take the egg’. During the operation her heart rate kept going very high 160+, low BP and short rapid breathing. It took the doctors to long to be able to wake her up. 

After waking up she kept fainting and not being able to stand up. She is still in the ICU (3days now) with low BP, unable to eat/drink and complaining from pain from the egg removal. Doctors keep telling me it’s normal and she will be fine in a week. But the fact that they had 8 doctors surrounding her, bringing ambulance and taking her to ER doesn’t seem normal at all. I lack medical knoweldge and would like to know what caused this, will she be okay. I’m scared. 

Thanks for the help.
