I think the cause of my depression is just broken dopamine receptors.
I've had many reasons growing up to be depressed, but gradually over time, they diminished and stopped being reasons anymore. It's like my brain latches onto excuses, because if you can identify what's making you depressed you have a shot at fixing it. But I legit don't know why I'm depressed.

I don't feel joy towards anything. Everything either bores me to death or gives me a lot of anxiety, and trust me I've tried a lot of things. It frustrates me so much that I turn to food, because it's the only thing that gives me joy. It's really sad but I can legit describe the feeling that food gives me as joy, because no other experience these days gives me anything close to that feeling.
