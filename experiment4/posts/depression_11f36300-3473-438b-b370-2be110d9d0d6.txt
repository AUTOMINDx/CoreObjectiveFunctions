Ten things depression tells me
1. You are unlovable. Die.
2. Your life is a mess. Die. 
3. You are worthless. Die.
4. Focus on every bad memory you have. Die.
5. The school bullies that made your life hell 15 years ago were right. Die.
6. You are ugly. Die.
7. You are thick. Die.
8. Your friends are doing much better in their lives than you are. Die. 
9. Everyone is laughing at you. Die.
10. Just. Fucking. Die. 

On a loop. Every day. All day.
