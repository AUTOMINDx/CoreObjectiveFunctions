How can I know the porn I watch is Abuse-Free?
Hey everyone.

So I'm using a side account for this one. Also, trigger warning I guess.

A couple of weeks ago I read a thread on r/greentext about the GirlsDoPorn case. What I found was some of the most despicable things I ever read. Rape, doxxing, suicide and lots of awful things.

Since then I became a bit paranoid on how much of the porn I consumed was indeed rape or abusive, so I stopped watching porn altogether. I never really consumed hardcore porn, casting couches or the ones where they pick up people from the street, mostly because I assumed those are the most shady. But apart of that, I truly don't know how to tell.

Is there a way to see which producers are abusive? Are there production houses that abide to safe porn? Or maybe I should just keep going and never watch porn again?

Sorry if it seems a bit alarmist but the thought of me enjoying others pain is something that scares me and want to avoid it as much as I can.

Thanks for everything. Have a nice day.
