Should liberals be looking for compromise and common ground with conservatives, or should we just be looking to create a fair democracy where they can be outvoted?
It seems like conservatives and liberals want incredibly different things. I hear liberals constantly claim that we want the same things, and just have different methods for achieving them. But one look at our sentiments towards the LGBTQ community should make it clear that we don’t want the same thing. Some of us want universal prosperity, others want prosperity only for people they approve of. 

So should we seek bipartisanship and commonality with a group that doesn’t even want equality (again, if equality was wanted by the right, then why would they feel comfortable supporting and affiliating with people who support things like a Muslim ban or legalized discrimination against the LGBTQ community?) or does that neglect/abandon minority groups?

Edit: I’d also wager that your average conservative recognizes that they don’t want the same thing liberals want, but don’t correct the liberals claiming otherwise cause they benefit from the misunderstanding.

Edit: you know what’s annoyingly stupid? Commenting on here “a fair democracy where the right loses? Sounds like you want a rigged system”. My dudes, the right loses the popular vote consistently. If pressed hard enough, they’ll straight up tell you that majority rule is a direct path to evil and tyranny. Let’s not play dumb with me.
