Good laptops for schoolwork and gaming?
Hello! Iâ€™m currently a senior in high school, and I was looking into a laptop that I could use for school. But, my current gaming laptop just bricked and I figured this is a good time to get a new one. What are some relatively powerful laptops that I can use for both light gaming (games like valorant, league, genshin, etc. or games which require more power) while also using it for school, if there is a device like that? Thanks for reading!
