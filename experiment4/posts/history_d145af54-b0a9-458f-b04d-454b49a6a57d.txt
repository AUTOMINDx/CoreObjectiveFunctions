There is quite a bit of science in regards to the earth being hit by a gamma ray burst in the year 774-775. Coincidently, in the Irish "Annals of the Four Masters" near that date is recorded-  


 

#### M767.7

The fair of the clapping of hands, *so called* because terrific and horrible signs appeared at the time, which were like unto the signs of the day of judgment, namely, great thunder and lightning, so that it was insufferable to all to hear the one and see the other. Fear and horror seized the men of Ireland, so that their religious seniors ordered them to make two fasts, together with fervent prayer, and one meal between them, to protect and save them from a pestilence, precisely at Michaelmas. Hence came the Lamhchomart, which was called the Fire from heaven.   


The precision of the Annals is often suspect, however, this appears at first glance to be more than a coincidence.  Any thoughts?
