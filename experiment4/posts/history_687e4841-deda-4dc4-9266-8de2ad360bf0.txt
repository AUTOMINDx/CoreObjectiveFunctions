I think I found a cook book made by Thomas edisons wife.
The cover has an image of Edison with his name "TH. A. Edison. The book itself is labeled "the Edison Compostion". The pages inside have worn handwritten recipes. The book is in VERY poor condition but its still holding together and the text is all legible. 

The most I could find on Google was that Edisons wife wrote cookbooks. There are no images on Google that match the cover of this book. 

Does anyone know what I have?
