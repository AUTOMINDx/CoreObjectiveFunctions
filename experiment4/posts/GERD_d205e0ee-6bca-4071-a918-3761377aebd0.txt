How am I supposed to figure out my triggers if I don't have heartburn?
Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with GERD today after seeing my ENT for a sore throat and ear ache that has come and gone for about three years. I rarely have heartburn--in fact, I think the last time I had heartburn may have been months or a year ago. Everything I'm reading about managing GERD says to fiddle with your diet and lifestyle to see what works for you, but how am I supposed to do that when I don't have any immediate feedback to let me know what the triggers are?
