Did some people with PTSD not feel that the traumatic event was traumatic until their PTSD symptoms appear a few months or years later?
For example, do those veterans with PTSD feel that war scenes were very traumatic to them at the moment they were at war? Or they initially didnâ€™t feel that those war scene left great trauma to them, and not until they began to have symptoms of PDSD and looked for therapy did they realized that those war scene were very traumatic to them?
