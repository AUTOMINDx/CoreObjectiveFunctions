Me and my cousin came out to eachother because of a game
So let me start by saying that my cousin is my aunts son and he is only 2 moths younger than me (we are both 16) and we were really close as kids but in our adolescent years we drifted apart a lot since we didn't have much in common.
We were at my house for a family function and  while all the adults were chatting we went to my room and all of us (my other cousins are younger than us) were just hanging out and we decided to play a mobile game and my username in that game was "girlinred" and my cousin saw it and asked me if I listened to girlinred ??
At that moment I was very scared but, I said "yessss  but how do you know about her?"
And he did the wrist flick thingy 
And I nodded 
I Said "Are you wrist flick?"
And he  said ya I am B, and I was like ohhh cool I am L. ( we talked in abbreviations because my other cousins know the meaning of bisexual and lesbian and we didn't want them to know yet so that's why)

My heart was racing so fast because he was the first family member and second person I have came out to and to my surprise found out I was not alone, which was pretty cool. We talked alot about how we found out and how long have we known and other stuff like that for a very long time.

I don't think I will be coming out to any of my other family members anytime soon... cause they are not supportive and I live with them.
But this is how I came our to my cousin brother and found out I am not the only queer in the family and I feel like a heavy weight has been lifted off of me and we have now found things which we are both interested in. So it's a win-win situation.
