Dad brings new girlfriend to thanksgiving and she's my new boss
I want to state here I love my dad he's always been an excellent father to me and my siblings and he's always been an amazing human being but this situation has gotten Very weird for me very fast. so to preface this my mother died at the beginning of this year. it happened very suddenly and none of us really saw it coming, My mom owned a business and was very skilled in her field I also work for that business, now my dad decides to sell the business and since I'm a pretty indispensable part of the business I come with the business, the woman who bought the business is a very nice and lovely woman let's call her Carol (obviously not her real name) I've known her for years she's also very skilled in her field and I had no problems what so ever going to work for her, life is going well then my dad comes to visit us (we live in different states) for thanksgiving and as soon as he gets into the house he said "we need to talk" not something you ever want to hear, he sits us down and tells us he's been dating Carol for about a month and she's coming to thanksgiving. I'll admit it wasn't a surprise that my dad was dating someone he's not exactly Subtle, I just didn't know who. It was a slightly awkward thanksgiving, I'm happy for my dad and Carol I really am, but I don't know things just seem really weird for me and I imagine it's going to be weird for a while hopefully I can shake off this weird feeling soon.
