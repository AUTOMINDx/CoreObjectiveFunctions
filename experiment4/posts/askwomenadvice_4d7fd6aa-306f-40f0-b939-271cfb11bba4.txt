(Throwaway) Suggestions for subtle vibrators that do NOT resemble realistic male genitalia (strict household)
I am 22 and live in a strict household that would not take it kindly if I have realistic dildos/vibrators lying around. I actually don't plan on being in a relationship in the foreseeable future and don't like casual sex at all, so this is my alternative. Looking for subtle ones, I found one that resembled a lipstick which I thought was cool. Anyone else has other suggestions?
