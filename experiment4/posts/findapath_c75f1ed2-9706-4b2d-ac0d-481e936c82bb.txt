Didn’t like college, not enjoying electrical apprenticeship. Now what?
I went into college right out of high school. I lasted about a year and a half and decided it wasn’t for me. Now I’m in an Electrical Apprenticeship and I’m not enjoying that either. It’s fine most of the time, I wanted to work with my hands rather than sit at a desk but the labor is already getting old and I don’t like the construction environment. Now I’m considering going back to college but I don’t know what for. I feel like I’m falling behind by wanting to change again. Any advice?
