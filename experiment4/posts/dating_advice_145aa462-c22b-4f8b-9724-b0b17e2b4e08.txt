I (25F) am dating a shy, inexperienced man (25M); how do I make sure he’s comfortable?
I recently matched with a man whom I found attractive. We chatted for a day and the conversation was really good that we decided to exchange numbers. The next day, we got on the phone and the conversation was okay in the beginning. Then I noticed when I was not asking questions or talking, there’ll be dead silence for a while till I started talking. I Came to learn that he’s actually very quiet, shy, and inexperienced. This is new territory for me, but I honestly think it’s cute.  There was one time when we had a FaceTime call though,it got super silent when I stoped asking questions. I noticed he was using his computer and when I asked what he was up to, he said he was looking up what to ask and then apologized for “being so bad at this.” He’s very smart and passionate about certain things the can speak more on.  I really just need advice from anyone who’s had a similar experience in dating. I like him and want to get to know him more. How do I make sure I respect his personality and not make him be insecure about it?
