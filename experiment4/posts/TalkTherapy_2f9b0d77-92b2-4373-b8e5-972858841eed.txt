Therapist remembering
How much of the details of what you say does your therapist remember? I don’t mean the big things that they should definitely remember, but little details.


I sometimes get the feeling that my therapist remembers a lot but that they sometimes say something like “I can’t remember the exact details of ____, can you remind me” or “you said something like __ or __” with the aim to get me to say the story again and see how it has changed in my retelling. Is that just paranoia?
