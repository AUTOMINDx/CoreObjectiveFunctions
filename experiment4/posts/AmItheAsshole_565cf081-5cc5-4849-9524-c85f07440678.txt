AITA for being "An ungrateful, spoiled brat" for the Christmas gift my husband got me?
I F35 wanna begin by saying that in every holiday me and my husband M33 (we both work decent jobs) set separate budgets for gifts. He uses his own money to buy gifts and I do the same.

We've been married for almost a year (together for 3) this is our first christmas as married couple. He mafe a list of every person he wanted to buy a gift for. I stumbled upon this list by accident and out of curiousity decided to take a look.


I found that he's friends/co works were on top of his list with gifts that cost over 5000 total. For example: he got an $600 wristwatch for his co worker, a $250 bracelet for his sister inlaw, and a $900 workout gear for his friend. There was more but that's all I could remember. What made me upset was that when I got to my name I saw that he bought me a $20 something kitchen spoon set (stainless steel). I was too shocked to ignore this and I had a confrontation with him about it. He argued that A. It's his money he's the one paying so I should not control that. And B. His co workers/friends are important to him and he's known them for ages. C. He said a gift should ne appreciated nomatter what it cost. I argued that he was disrespecting me and dismissing my feeling with the gift he chose to get me not to mention that I spend a lot of money for his gifts to buy him his favorite shoe/gaming brands but he got upset and said I was acting like an ungrateful, spoiled brat and urged me to get rid of this attitude and accept what I'm giving. The argument got worse and we stopped talking to each other.


He still says I'm being ridiculous with my overreaction and should stop. Did I overreact?
