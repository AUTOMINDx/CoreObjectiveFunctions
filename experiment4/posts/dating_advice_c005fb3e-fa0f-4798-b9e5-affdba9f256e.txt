Not sure how normal this is
A guy told me that the first time he came to my house he looked through my trash can in my bathroom looking to find condoms and looked through my cabinet. I thought he was lying until he described how my vibrator looked. He said the vibrator showed that I'm not "out here f*cking". I'm certain that isn't normal or appropriate and makes me terrified to ever invite anyone to my home ever again. Not to mention he is a big tech guy so I'm hoping he didn't put a camera in my house :/ he told me he shut down his ex's WiFi after she kicked him out..
