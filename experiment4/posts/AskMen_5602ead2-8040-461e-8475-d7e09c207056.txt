Dudes of Reddit.. When was the last time you cried?
I didn’t expect it to blow up this much(I know everybody says it!) Thank you for everybody for replying! I’m going to do my best to reply to all of you! Unfortunately I have to go the bed at this point because 330 am comes way to early in the morning!

Edit #2. 
Well there’s no catching up on comments with this one! I’m glad to read that you all are able to let those emotions out! If your going through a rough time in life just know there’s always somebody to talk to and if you feel like there isn’t my inbox is open! 
Let the emotions flow you beautiful bastards!
