My biggest fear happened
For reference, I have panic disorder as well as agoraphobia. At the beginning of the year I was having panic attacks everytime I had to work. And had to miss days multiple times a week, and I couldn't go into stores. I got diagnosed and medicated a few months ago, and got to a point where I'm able to work every shift, and even go to grocery stores by myself. 

The panic disorder made me so afraid of having a panic attack in a public or crowded space I was basically housebound.

Two days a go my family had a Christmas get together. I have a large family with lots of young cousins. I was a little worried about the crowd an noise but pretty optimistic as I had ear plugs and I hopped that would do the trick. 

Boy was I wrong. I had a really bad panic attack, I was in another room but my family kept coming in to watch and made a big scene out of it. Some people where freaking out when I'd faint, witch made the situation worse and I was terrified. I hated the attention and was so embarrassed.

Now today, it's Monday. And I was so horrified of it happening again, I had an anxiety attack before work. I asked my boss to come in later and she said yes. But as it got closer to the time to go in, I kept having anxiety attacks so I had to call off my shift all together. 

I'm thankful my boss is very understanding of my situation, but I just feel like I've been set back by this. I haven't left my room all day, it's made me depressed. I'm just really hopping I get better again.
