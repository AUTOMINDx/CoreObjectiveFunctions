Can DPDR cause this physical foggy symptom?
Can DPDR cause extreme foggyness that feels like a physical sensation? It's really hard to describe but I feel 'groggy' and spaced out all the time. I feel it a lot around my eyes it's almost as if they're dry or something. I also have really bad brain fog and general fatigue. In the past I've also have other more typical DPDR symptoms (been suffering from this for 5+ years), but these days the physical sensation is by far the worst, although my thought patterns are also weird at times.

Thanks for reading I appreciate any replies
