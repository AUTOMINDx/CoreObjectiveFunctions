Knights and Squires in the Last Duel
Hello there. I recently read the book The Last Duel (haven't seen the movie yet) and it raised a question about knighthood/nobility in the 14th-15th centuries.

In the book, Jean Carrouges is said to be a Squire until the age of around 50, before being Knighted after the campaign in Scotland. But his father was a Knight. Le Gris was a Squire until the duel I think, where he was knighted so they would be on equal terms. But they both held lands, manors, political offices/military commands etc. 

I had previously been under the impression that a Squire was essentially an "apprentice knight" but after doing some light reading on the subject I am not so sure. I was wondering, is Squire a title? As in the lowest "rung" if Nobility, or some kind of functionary office? Is it hereditary? What makes you eligible to become a knight if you are a Squire? Is military service, regardless of birth, the prerequisite for a Knighthood? Basically, how does the rank of knight, squire, relate to noble birth/common birth etc.

I know that answers obviously change with what century/place you're talking about, so I suppose I am specifically asking in the 14th-15th centuries (1350-1450 say?) around about "Western Europe" (England, France, Italy, HRE, etc) But if anyone has some extra tidbits to add about other areas (Bohemia, Hungary/Croatia, Poland) that would be interesting as well.
