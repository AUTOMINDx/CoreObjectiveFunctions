My neighbor shot himself
Two days ago my neighbor shot himself. I heard a noise coming from the backyard that sounded like a car crash. I went outside and found him lying dead on his back patio with extreme damage to his head, and, well it was very graphic. I can't stop thinking about it. 

I've been getting random waves of panic/sadness. The image of his body is carved into my memory. I can't sleep at all. I panic a little every time I look out the back window, and expect to see him still in his yard. I feel guilty for being a shut I'm neighbor. I feel like everything is just pointless in perspective.

I'm in a new job, and my wife is pregnant, so I don't know if I can allow myself time to process this. I've been attempting to let it out at night after my wife falls asleep. Also, I'm tired and my thoughts are all over the place so apologies for my jumbled brain dump

Update: Thank you for all the kind words and advice. I have been talking to people, including my wife, and I think I was just overwhelmed by the loss of control over my own emotions. Over the weekend I've been trying to just deal with it head on, and slowly just tried to relive the memory (as much as I can stand). I have rewatched the backdoor nest video a few times (doesn't show the neighbor, just hear the shot and see my response). I haven't had a wave of panic for the first time today so it's working maybe? Or maybe just confirmation bias. I'm looking into therapy, hopefully I can get in somewhere soon.
