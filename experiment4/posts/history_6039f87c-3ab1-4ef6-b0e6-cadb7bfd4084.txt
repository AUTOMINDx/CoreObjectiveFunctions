I would like to revisit all those history and social studies classes that I never paid much attention to when I was in school. What's a good way to do that?
Basically the title.

I remember vaguely learning about the Fertile Crescent, and ancient China, and The American Revolution, and Napoleon, and the Russian Revolution, and the American Civil War, and the American Civil Rights Movement, and these things.

But it's been so long, I was a stupid kid, I didn't want to be in school, and I didn't recognize the relevance and importance of these things until much later. But now I'm really interested, and almost wish I could go back and sit through all those classes all over again. 

How would you recommend getting started?
