Most important royal and nobility families up until the end of the Thirty Years' War?
Hello everyone. I have recently entered a history competition at school which consists of three tests which have different history themes. The first test is about nobility until the end of the Thirty Years' War. As I'm personally mainly interested in the 1800's I don't know a lot about this topic so i was just wondering where should I start researching it or what materials I should read to get a grasp on it. Thanks everyone.
