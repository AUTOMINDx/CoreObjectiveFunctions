Addicted mother &amp; a need for people who understand
Iâ€™ve grown up with a mother whoâ€™s been an alcoholic my entire life (she tries to tell us otherwise). A few years back, it got to the point where she was admitted to hospital and told that if she didnâ€™t stop, it would kill her. Fast forward to now, and sheâ€™s still drinkingâ€¦ whilst itâ€™s not as much, itâ€™s becoming unbearable. 
Iâ€™m lucky enough to not live at home anymore, but I still constantly get dragged into it because my dad is so scared of losing her, as am I, but I think I distance myself because Iâ€™m at the brink of what I can handle. I grew up having a very co-dependant relationship with my mum, for a good while I didnâ€™t know how to survive with out her and Iâ€™m still not sure how I would, even tho I function with out her daily. I think I would feel like Iâ€™d lost a major part of my identity. Iâ€™m so jealous of people that manage to distance themselves emotionally and physically . 

I donâ€™t really have anyone I can talk to that truly understands the heart wrenching feeling of hearing sheâ€™s back on the drink or coming home and being able to tell instantly sheâ€™s had a drink. Itâ€™s ruined our relationship and my relationships with others, I have no boundaries or standards because Iâ€™m so desperate to feel secure. I donâ€™t truly trust anyone anymore and I feel like my dads therapist. I am also going to therapy and getting through it, I guess I just needed to vent and find people who can relate ðŸ§¡
