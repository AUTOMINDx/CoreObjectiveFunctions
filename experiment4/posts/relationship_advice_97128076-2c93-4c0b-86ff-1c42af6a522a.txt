I want more kids but husband doesn’t.
So as the title says I (29F) want my kids and my husband (27M) doesn’t. I have two kids from my first marriage who are 9 and 6. I always planned on having more kids someday as I had my first very young and wanted to work on my career and life goals before adding to the family. Then my ex and I got divorced and it looked like that chapter of my life was over. But I met my husband and fell in love and we got married almost two years ago. He knew when we got married that I wanted more kids, I knew he didn’t want them “right now” as he said. But since he is a couple years younger than me I just figured we would wait a few years, no big deal. He is a great dad to our two boys and has completely jumped into the role of a father since their birth dad decided me being remarried meant he no longer had to be a parent. 

Well, at this point I’m at a place in my career where having another baby would be ideal before moving onto the next step, he knows this too and as I’m nearing thirty it seems more and more like a now or never thing. But recently he’s changed from “not right now” to no more ever. I appreciate so much that he has stepped up with the boys but it sucks giving up something I wanted and always thought was a possibility. 

He doesn’t understand why I would be bothered by it because I have two kids and I get that but I can’t help feeling disappointed. I have given up so much in my life to make other people happy and I just feel like this is just one more thing on that list.

Edit: I didn’t make it clear in the original post but my husband claimed he changed his mind but when I tried to understand why he said he never actually intended to have any more kids but was just saying what I wanted to hear and hoping I would change my mind.
