Does the feeling of "longing for a hero" ever goes away?
I know we are the ones who need to take our life together, who need to work on ourselves, and do all the adult stuff, and we are responsible for our own well being. I know that, I understand it, I'm doing it, I don't expect someone to come and save me. 

But when I'm tired I can't avoid to wish for... a savior? a hero? a caretaker? Someone who just say "You can relax, I got all under control, you are safe" 

I know this thinking is because of past trauma, but does this longing ever goes away? Does it get better as we heal? I feel so silly thinking this, and then feel worse when I realize, no one is coming.
