I feel like living with parents is effecting my mental health.
I’m 24 and I’ve lived with my parents pretty much most of my life. 3 years ago I worked in Virginia for a year in residential security and I absolutely loved it I met a lot people and got really good at socializing and trusting my confidence. Im really contemplating just moving out just to move out even though I don’t have the means to. I noticed that Im becoming more distant and I don’t have friends anymore and my dating life… haha is non existent. Honestly I want to have a life and have a sense of freedom.

I’d like to hear from you guys because it is a big step and I need encouragement. What you did to move out or if you have any plans to move out? What are some good tips to create your own network of friends and people? what do you do for work to provide that kind of living?
