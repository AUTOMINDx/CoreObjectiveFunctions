Is job title or salary more important?
Iâ€™ve got my end of year review coming up in January and was going to ask for a promotion. How important is your job title for you? Is it good to earn less now, but with a more promising future outlook? This could mean more money later on. A friend sent me this [blog](https://progressionapp.com/blog/what-should-my-job-title-be-5-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-job-title/?r=1) and it's made me think having a higher job title will open more doors in the long run so it might be better to take a short-term hit on salary. Would it be better to stay on the same amount of salary with a great title for future earnings down the line or should I focus on money? How much of a difference does a job title make to earnings?

Some people are saying that we should name the job according to how we want to get paid, which sounds like dressing for the occasion. I feel pressured because most people build their assumptions basing it in our job title. In many cases, the roles are changing faster than the titles can even reflect.
