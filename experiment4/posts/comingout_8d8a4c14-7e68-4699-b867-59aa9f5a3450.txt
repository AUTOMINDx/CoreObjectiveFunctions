how do I let go of the fear
Im a lesbian… and I know everyone knows and nobody cares but I care. Old old school butch, lots a tie dye, nature’s child, stoner vibes. But I'm also conservative (I wasn’t raised that way but I ended up so). And god it bothers me that I’ve only ever truly loved women. Im scared. Scared of another crack in my heart. I don’t want to dive into that life and end up alone. I’m hard to love. Im stubborn, arrogant and eccentric. And full of useless pride. The sort of ego that won’t let me be truly vulnerable, letting my self be unapologetically in love. I think I missed out on the love of my life. Just because I’m scared. She was too. In my arms one night she so quietly sighed saying “u know, I can’t give my parents two gay kids”. I understood. Now I’m in a new state and im just trying accept it and go forward. It not the be all end all but I really see a women beside me when I achieve my future goals. I watched Gentleman jack for the first time over the holiday. When Lister says “please don’t hurt me” I so vividly felt all the past heartbreak thats behind that. I wish I was braver.
