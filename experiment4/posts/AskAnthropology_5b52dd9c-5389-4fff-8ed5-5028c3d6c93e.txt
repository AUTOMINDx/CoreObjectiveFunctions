Have the Sami indulged in any sort of organized violence in their history? If so, what did such incidents entail?
Are there any records of the Sami conducting raids on their enemies, engaging in internal blood feuds, etc.? If so, what are the details of such occurrences? I've heard of some claims that they were "entirely peaceful", but those are usually motivated by the desire to prop up a "noble savage" type narrative. Thus, I always take them with a grain of salt.

The only information I've came across regarding Sami violence is a minor uprising in the 1850s against the Norwegian government. If Wikipedia is to be believed, all that really happened was that a small band of disaffected Sami murdered a local merchant and a government official, and then were arrested and executed for it.
