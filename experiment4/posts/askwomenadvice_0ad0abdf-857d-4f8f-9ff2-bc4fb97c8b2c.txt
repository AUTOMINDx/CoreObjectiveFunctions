Coworkers think I’m starving myself and it makes me feel bad about my body, unsure of what to do.
I work in all female office environment. I’m one of the youngest employees in my department. I’m 4’11 and 105 pounds and I have a small frame, I was pretty comfortable with my weight and body and I thought it was a healthy weight for someone my height. I eat breakfast and by the time lunch rolls around I’m still full but I’ll have a snack later or eat a meal when I get home, I’ve always been this way. For a few months now my coworkers have been analyzing my eating habits/commenting on my weight with concern and constantly asking about whether or not I ate. I keep getting asked if I’ve eaten, today my coworker told me she just likes to check on if I’m eating. She often makes comments about how I’m skinny. It all makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I’m not really sure what to do or say when this happens. I always feel like I almost have to prove to them that I’ve eaten or let them know so they’ll stop making comments about it. It’s starting to make me feel bad about my own body, and it makes me feel a bit bombarded. I understand feeling concerned for someone, but it verges on being intrusive and making assumptions about me that aren’t true. Does anyone have any advice on how I can go about addressing this without getting personal or starting a conflict?
