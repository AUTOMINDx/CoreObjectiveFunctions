Cuddling with Female Friends
So I (22M) have found out that cuddling with your female friends is super weird (source: group of friends). I used to cuddle (and I still do) with a lot of my female friends even the ones that had a boyfriend. When I mean cuddling I mean spooning on the couch or on the bed just chilling and nothing else. However my friends told me that those girls were probably flirting with me because that is not something you do with "just" a friend. I am really confused. Is it that strange?

EDIT: I read a lot people thinking that I am gay. I am straight, like for real
