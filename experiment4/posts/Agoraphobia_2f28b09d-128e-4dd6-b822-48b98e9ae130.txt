had a bad experience tonight :(
I really don't leave my apartment often, except when I go out occasionally with my bf. I am chronically ill with anxiety but it turned into a fear that my illness will feel extremely worse if I leave my apartment. it's true sometimes but other times its irrational. it's hard to navigate. but anyways, today I decided I didn't want to be restless tonight, so i'd go shop for my moms christmas present.

I decided to go to bath and body works because my dad had sent me a picture of a coupon they got in the mail for a free item. it was hard for me to get out of my car and go inside. it took awhile. but once i did I spent so much time smelling everything and picking out what my mom would like best, and I was so excited to surprise her. with my condition I can't go to school OR work a job, so this little coupon was kind of the only way I could get something for my mom that would be an actual surprise 

but when I got to the register I was already fumbling to get my earbuds off and feeling anxious, and I sat my items down and showed her the coupon on my phone. she was really abrupt and snapped saying "I CANT take this off your phone?!? you need it physically!!!!" and said it like I was extremely dumb for even trying. she was barely looking at me and didn't even try to look at the picture of the coupon on my phone 

it triggered some response in me, I felt like I was getting in trouble and on top of that, I was already so anxious to go in the store, I apologized and put the items back and as soon as I left the store I started crying.

i've been sitting in my car crying ever since and I can't even drive home right now. I feel like obviously it's an overreaction, and an anxious reaction, but i was just so disappointed and I regret even coming out now. my stomach really hurts now too and I just feel sick all around

i'm just having a bad night :( but probably after all this crying i'll sleep like a baby. lmao
