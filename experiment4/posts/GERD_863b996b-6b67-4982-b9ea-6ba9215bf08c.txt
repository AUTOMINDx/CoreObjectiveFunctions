Ugh went to ER
So I was out of control this morning.  After a long night at work I went to the coffee shop and had a large hot chocolate, tiramisu, a brownie, and a spinach quiche.  Stress eating.  Than I get a flat tire on the way home.  I go to bed and wake up an hour later and I can’t breathe and my heart is pounding.  It gets a little better but I’m shaky.  I have a flat tire now so luckily I walk to the ER that’s only block away from me and they work me up and say I’m ok. EKG and labs are normal.  Felt better as I waited for the labs to get back.  Diagnosis is palpitations. 
I’ve just been feeling extremely bloated and burping constantly.  I have a crappy diet and inhale my food.  
My GI doc said I had mild gastritis a year ago.  No Sibo.  I didn’t follow any of his recommendations.  Clean diet and omeprazole.
Maybe I need to start now.  
What sucks the most is how I get it confused with my heart since I see a cardiologist for hypertension and arrhythmia.  
I’m 5’10 255 and carry ALL my weight in my stomach.  I have a 50 inch waist.  I look pregnant.  And I’m a guy. 
Any encouragement would be great, thanks guys.
