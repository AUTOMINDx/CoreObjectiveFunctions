I want to quit after 4 months
So I just got hired at a job 4 months ago and I already want to leave. The job is almost 40 minutes away from where I currently live and I spend a lot on gas and car repairs as a result. The pay is meh, but I kind of rushed getting it because it was my first interview after graduating. I was job hunting for over three months before I started here so I got scared and accepted it.

The work is unfulfilling and the environment is very hard to navigate. I feel that people look down on me because of my age but they also do not care that I’m an introvert. Instead, I am pushed to be more social when really I think my coworkers just want to gossip. I’m thinking about leaving this position pretty early because I honestly thought working in the field would be a bit more rewarding, but I really dislike the work. I go home everyday relieved and return to work extremely anxious.


Should I try to stick it out to at least six months or find something and go? What would you do?
