Having a PTSD attack and need to vent
Its all because my fiancé died on me almost 4 months ago. All that was left was his bodily fluids spilled all over the floor when I went to go clear his apartment out with his friends and siblings. I screamed in the hallway the second and last time I was there “HOW HARD IS IT TO CLEAN UP THIS DAMN MESS? WHAT KIND OF LANDLORD DOESNT CALL FOR HAZMAT CLEAN UP?!???”

I was his first responder, I had to call the cops because he wouldn’t answer his door. He was only 34. I know, I know, I need to find a PTSD therapist. I’m only 32 this is bullshit. His family will get the autopsy results soon, but I dont wanna know anymroe. I have his cat, shes 11.
