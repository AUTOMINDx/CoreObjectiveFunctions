Gerd is ruining my mental health
The title basically says it all. I haven't been diagnosed yet but Im seeing the gastrologist tomorrow. I'm more than sure I have GERD/LPR. I've bee reading other peoples stories and for fucks sake it sounds miserable. I'm starting to feel maybe I'm better off dead. I see no joy In life when there's too much restrictions and suffering especially if it's only going to get worse. I'm sure this goes for everyone though. Sorry, I'm just having a mental breakdown and need to rant.
