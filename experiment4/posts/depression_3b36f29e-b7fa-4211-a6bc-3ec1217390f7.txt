My parents didn’t take my depression seriously.
TW: suicide/self harm 

Today, me and my mom got into an intense argument. In the heat of the moment, I grabbed a knife and really wanted to end it. My mom saw and was mad. She kept asking me how and why I’m even depressed when they’ve been really good parents (this is 100% true though, they’ve really provided for me) but can’t seem to grasp why I’m depressed. She said it wasn’t logical. I tried telling her what I feel then proceeds to counter each point. I’ve been contemplating for awhile but hesitated because I already knew I didn’t want it to be “gory”.

My dad on the other hand, really didn’t care much. Later that day, things were better and in a lighter mood. My dad referred to my earlier incident as a moment of “mood swing” and even joked about it. 

I feel so fucking torn apart. It seems that this is all drama and entitlement for them. If anything, I’m now more determined to keep everything inside because they act like this once they find out. I really want to go. It seems my mom would be most affected but my dad would just be indifferent and possible not care at all.
