(22F) Truly lost figuring out 'what I want to be when I grow up'
It's becoming a source of neverending existentialism for me at the minute. 

I've started 4 different uni courses (nursing, law, social work, crimsoc), got 6 months in and got bored and dropped it. I'm constantly picking up new hobbies and interests, hyperfixating and then finding a new one, so though I have lots of interests, I have no real passion or dream job. 

Ideally I want a job that can be flexible, maybe involves travel. I adore arts and crafts and working with kids. I'd love to be able to make a living out of the crafts I love (which again is pretty much everything due to my habit of picking up new things)

How do you figure out a path when you have so many interests, but don't actually know what your real passion is?
