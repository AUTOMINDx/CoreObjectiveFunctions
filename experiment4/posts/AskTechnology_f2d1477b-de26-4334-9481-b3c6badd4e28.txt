Why does Best Buy charge $45 for a 100ft ethernet cord when Amazon charges $17?
My gf was upset cause she thought she was gonna have to spend $45 on a ethernet cord. She works from home and they installer couldn't run a coax to her bedroom, so she has the the modem in the living room.

So I go on Amazon and boom $17 for a 100ft cable. I guess the installer said something along the lines of if the coax is too long it'll cause connections issues.

I hope this is the right sub, if not I'll repost to the right sub if someone could redirect me.
