everything feels hopeless. i can't see my life ever improving
i have agoraphobia, along with bpd, ptsd, depression and other anxiety disorders. due to the severity of my mental illnesses, i'm stuck living with and being completely dependent on my parents, i have no friends, no job and no education either. i became homebound when i was 13 and i'm 23 now. i only leave the house to go to therapy, but infrequently

i feel completely worthless. i have no purpose or fulfilling reason to stay alive. everyone else has friends, interests, hobbies, goals, education, jobs and lives that are worth waking up to everyday. they can go outside, socialise and be complex people who can feel happiness and succeed at the things they try. i just sit in my room alone doing nothing like i have for the last 10 years.

i hate thinking about how much of my life i've wasted being unable to do things other people can do so easily, i dont want to be like this forever but it feels impossible. so impossible most days i want to just give up. every time i try to push myself i fall back down and i lose all my progress. it all feels so pointless sometimes. i just wish i was normal, but it feels like all i'll ever be is a failure and a burden.
