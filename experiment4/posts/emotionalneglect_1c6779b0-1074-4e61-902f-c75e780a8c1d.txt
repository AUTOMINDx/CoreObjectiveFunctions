DAE have trouble with pronunciation?
Since I spent most of my childhood alone and ignored I spent a lot of time reading. When I read I often came across new words, new places, new idioms, and new synonyms to other words I already knew. But since I never had anyone to talk to I never learned how to correctly pronounce them.

As a kid, when I was brave enough to use a new word I’d be ridiculed for trying to be “too smart” or ridiculed for my pronunciation. It forced me to intentionally limit the words I used and to avoid a word if I wasn’t 100% sure about the pronunciation.

Now I find myself doing the same thing. I avoid words that have multiple pronunciations or any words that seem “big”. 

I don’t even try sometimes, I just assume my pronunciation is wrong. Other times I refer to things as “that thingy” or something similar to avoid the word.

Worse, I find myself treating others the way my parents treated me and if they use the proper term for something I’ll wave it away and say “oh whatever, you know what I’m talking about”.

Can anyone relate? In some instances it’s called linguistic insecurity, but I’ve never seen it directly related to trauma. 

PS - this is a great community and I feel less alone now that I found you. Thanks y’all.
