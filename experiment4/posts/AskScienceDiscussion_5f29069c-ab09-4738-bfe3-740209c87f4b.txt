Contributions to science outside of traditional papers in journals?
I read once that Dawkins was an example of contributions to science that came from a scientist just skipping journals and publishing themselves. Is this an accurate characterization? If so, what are other examples of contributions to scientific consensus that came from sources other than peer-reviewed papers published in scientific journals? If this entire concept isn't really applicable, then let me know about that instead! Thank you!
