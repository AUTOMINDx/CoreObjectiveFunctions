Why is deflation a bad thing?
Hey guys! I'm not super informed on economics but I hear people talking about how inflation (in moderation) is good and deflation is super bad. However this doesn't make much sense, why is it a good thing that my money is worth less every year? I've heard that in 1900, 1 dollar was worth around \~$35 today. Nowadays that's half a bottle of coke or a cheap burger from McDonald's. I just don't see how money being worth less every year is a good thing, like in 2100 will a bottle of coke be $200? And is that a good thing? I would really like a professional explanation.
