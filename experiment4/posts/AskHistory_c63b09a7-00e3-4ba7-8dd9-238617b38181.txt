What are some of the most interesting and well researched events or civilizations etc. up to the year 1500 CE?
I have to do a final project for a History class on anything history related up to the year 1500CE. I’m having trouble choosing a topic because it’s such a huge stretch of time from prehistory to 1500CE it’s like a needle in a haystack so I thought I’d ask r/AskHistory for some suggestions. I’m partially so indecisive because I tend to find modern world history more interesting like 1500 and beyond. Thanks for reading this post!
