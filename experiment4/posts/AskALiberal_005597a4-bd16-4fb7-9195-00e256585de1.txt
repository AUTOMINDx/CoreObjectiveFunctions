How can we deal with the Right when they hear things like this?
On Fox News this morning, I heard a commentator blame "Pete  Buttigieg" for the deadly crash that resulted in the truck driver receiving a 110 year prison sentence because of lax licensing requirements for drivers.    


Well, yes, Buttigieg is the Secretary of Transportation, but states, not the federal government, issue licenses, and the deadly crash occurred in 2019.  Buttigieg  was sworn into office February 3, 2021.
