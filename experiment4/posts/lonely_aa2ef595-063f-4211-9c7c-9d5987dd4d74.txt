The older I get, the more unattainable a romantic relationship seems to be.
I don’t even know if I catch feelings for anyone anymore. I do have a bit of a crush on an online friend but we’ve never met IRL so I don’t know if I count that….

Before, I used to think, “It’s fine. I’ll meet someone eventually.” But now that I’m nearing 27, it just seems like it’s never going to happen. I’m nervous now to even tell dates that I’ve never had a long term relationship because I’m scared it’ll reflect poorly on me or my lack of experience will scare them away. Maybe that’s just my mom’s judgment of me getting in my head though.
