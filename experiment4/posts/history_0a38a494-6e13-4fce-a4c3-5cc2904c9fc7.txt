United Fruit Company in Guatemalan Civil War
Today I was doing a little research on the Mayan massacre (84-85). Did a little digging around and found out that the 1954 Guatemalan Civil War was allegedly perpetrated by the top board of United Fruit Company(a.k.a Chiquita Brand International as of today).  Seemingly they were the once that stood to loose the most if the anti-communist government in Guatemala around that time had toppled, all the more the reason. But I couldn't find any references to them claiming responsibility or even apologizing. Furthermore Chiquita, now a billion dollar company celebrated their 30 years of operating  in Guatemala last year, February. Is there is any such reference or a justification that I missed? 

A lot of people died and decades of war in an already poor state for corporate profits. I found this terribly disturbing and just want to know better.
