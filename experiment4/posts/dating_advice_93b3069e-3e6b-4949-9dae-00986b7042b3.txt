The girl I'm dating wants to wait until marriage
Some context. I've been dating this girl for over a month now and went on a date with her today. She's a virgin and very religious. 

On the date, we kissed and all but I noticed she wasn't really comfortable with anything more sexual. I asked her and she confirmed it, so I obviously let it go. However, after the date, I started connecting the dots in my head and realized the possibility that she wanted to wait until marriage was a pretty solid one.

I texted her and asked, and she again confirmed it and said "I only want to have sex after marriage and nothing could possibly change my mind," with all the words. 

I crave a sexual and emotional connection with a partner, as I think both are ways of solidifying the relationship. The fact that she doesn't want to have sex AT ALL for what would be years is kind of a deal breaker for me.

Otherwise, we're pretty compatible. What should I do? Should I continue to date her and enjoy the moments or let it go? Was I too blunt? Did I ask too early?
