Would you take a pay cut to move from a technician role into an engineering one?
Hello everyone!
I graduated with a BS in Mechatronics engineering back in Feb 2020. I found a job in the semiconductor industry working in the manufacturing floor as a test engineer/tech.
Within 8 months, I got a promoted into team lead managing 10 other techs. 

I utilized my lead role to make connections with an engineering director. One day he invited me out for lunch and he talked about a specific engineering position he’s going to open up and he said I would be perfect for the position. I told him that I am interested and I would gladly apply once the position is posted on the internal job board.

I applied and got the offer yesterday, it’s an entry level engineering position with lots of flexibility and lots of freedom and creativity. I am very much interested in the position but I am going to be taking around a 20k$ pay cut annually.

As a tech, we get paid hourly and we work 9 hours a day plus 8 on Saturdays and holidays. I got spoiled with all the overtime and double time money I was making.

But on the other hand, in the engineering role i’ll be handling the maximum escalation level so there’s the opportunity to learn and grow and build my reputation in the company and the area I am based in on the expense of a salary cut.

I accepted the offer but the doubts have been plaguing my mind lately, I am not sure how many hours i’ll work per day in the new position and if an escalation pops up over the weekend, I am not really sure if I have to be next to a laptop or a phone but I guess the new boss is understanding regarding these situations. Anyways what really drew me in the most is that the director told me the new position would open a lot of doors and career opportunities to me, all the FAANG companies actively look for similar roles and the salaries for the highly skilled are extremely high.

Would you take the 20k pay cut?
