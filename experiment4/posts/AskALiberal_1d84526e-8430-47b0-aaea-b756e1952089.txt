What is the most contradictory thing about you?
For example, I'm about as far left as you can get, am worried about climate change,but I work for a right wing construction company and own and drive af250

To clarify, I don't mean this in a disparaging way or blame anybody for any of the contradictions you might be aware of. In my own life, I work construction because I have a criminal history and that's about all I could do, and I drive a big truck because I have to haul heavy s*** around. I mean this only in an introspective way. It's hard to be completely consistent, and nobody should be blamed for it.
