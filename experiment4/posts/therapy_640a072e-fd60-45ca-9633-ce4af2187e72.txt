The real issue with "therapy"
It's supposed to be this open forum where you discuss everything, but the moment you touch upon anything serious or dark they panic and suggest going to the hospital. For example, I've been suicidal for years. Years. I've put in enough unsuccessful attempts to batter and beat my own brain, but I feel miserable sometimes and these intense and dark feelings and calls to action I have when I want to act on them if I just talk to somebody I get it out of my system.

Why in God's name do people like therapists, counselors, or whomever else in therapeutic fields refuse to touch the darkest of feelings? Like isn't their entire role attending to the miserable? 

I felt it, that way, and told my counselor and he suggested "going to the hospital" where they would babysit me for three days to a week without an option of leaving. My therapist one time I admitted to having simmering thoughts of wanting to off myself and the dude called the cops for a safety checkup. Both of them refused to actually communicate about my thoughts and feelings regarding suicide.

The most important part of my mental health.
