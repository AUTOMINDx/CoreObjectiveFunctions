Feel like I can’t “sit” right in my body
I’m not exactly sure how to phrase it but personally that’s what it feels like. I feel like there’s my physical body, but MY actual body is feels like it’s exactly 2 steps upwards and one step to the right. People say they feel like they are watching from a 3rd point of view, but I don’t have that. I just feel like my body and like my sense of touch and everything is slightly off and I want to sit back into my body properly. When I touch things, it feels different, almost like something is blocking me from touching it like a very thin cloth or something. It feels more “numb” then when I’m not like this. Also my eyes won’t fucking focus. Idkk how to describe this but I feel like everything in my vision is combined into one single blur. I can’t focus on specific things.

I also feel EXTREMELY weak. This will last weeks at a time and it’s ruining my life. I can barely get out of bed I feel so weak and I can’t think or have coherent conversations. It gets boring as hell but I legit can’t do anything

Edit- I also feel emotionally numb. Like fully numb. I’m someone who cries almost everyday and who is extremely depressed, but like this, I feel absolutely nothing.

Edit edit- (sorry keep thinking of new things) but when I’m like this I can’t be bothered to do any “self care”. Showering is hard enough, I’ll take one every few days, will wet my hair, not even shampoo or condition it, then I’ll throw it up in a bun. Won’t put and lotion on. By the time I’m out of my dissociation episode, my hair is one huge disgusting matted knot that I have to deal with.
