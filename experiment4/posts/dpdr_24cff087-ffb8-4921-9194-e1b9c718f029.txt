Just want to fake my death and start a new life
I always dream about somehow faking my death and then changing my identity before moving to a new place. Drop all contact with everyone. I read a lot of articles about people who randomly got up and left and have been missing for decades, I’m sure a lot of them had a mental health crisis, changed identity and became much happier in their new life. I want to leave everything behind. I hate the current me. I have for the 22 years I’ve been alive. I just want to start a new slate. 

My name disgusts me, my body disgusts me, my memories and experiences disgust me. I think I’ll always feel this out of place. Apparently this feeling of displacement was supposed to go away as I finished puberty but here I am in my 20s and still as unhappy as ever. Even in fantasies where I become rich and famous I still wouldn’t be happy. I won’t be happy until I become a completely new person.
