Does anyone else absolutely hate staying in someone else’s home?
I’ve always had a weird thing about my own personal space. But staying in someone’s home just seems like an anxiety fueled nightmare. I absolutely hate it and choose a hotel over even staying with family if given the chance.

Anyone else?

EDIT: Love this community. Y’all are amazing. Also staying in a hotel this Christmas while my family stays at my MIL’s and they understand:)
