DAE get anxiety “hangovers” after days of spiraling?
Does anyone here with health anxiety (or other obsessive-type behaviors) feel like you still have an anxiety “hangover” the next day or two after whatever you were binging on or obsessively worried about has died down or resolved itself? For example, from Friday to Monday I was absolutely spiraling over some unnerving health test results — I spent three whole days doing nothing but researching the possible implications, periodically stopping to force myself to eat or clean. Today I feel much better, but I still have a sense of jumpiness or amped-upedness while simultaneously being really tired :( anyone else feel me? Any tips? Thanks.
