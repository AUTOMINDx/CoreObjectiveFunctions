Boyfriend(29m) of 5 months came for dinner and refused to eat my dinner (27F)
I invited my boyfriend of 4 months over for dinner. He was coming straight from work at 6 pm so I knew he would be hungry so I spent a few hours making a beef stew curry. When he came over and asked him if he would like to eat now or later he said ***“No thanks, I’ll buy a takeaway on my way home… I don’t like people doing things for me”.*** I was so offended especially after the effort I went through to make this meal he has never even eaten my food before and I know I am a good cook. I am actually livid. How would you feel if that happened to you?

The same thing happened last week at a Wonderland for his birthday I had bought tickets including rides he was frantically looking for an atm the whole time when he found one he withdrew the total cost of the experience e.g $100 and gave it to me which defeats the purpose of a birthday gift or experience and he said he doesn’t like people paying for stuff for him like what am I supposed to do here.
