How much PTO should I take? Been at job less than a year
I have 44 hours of PTO left that I’ve accrued, but haven’t used. I’ve been at this job about 7 months. I’ve taken 40 hours of PTO so far, which I used mostly around Thanksgiving.  I don’t want to give my boss the impression that I need to use all that time off this month, but also seems like my coworkers take time off often.  I can carry it over. Would it be better to use some before the end of the year?
