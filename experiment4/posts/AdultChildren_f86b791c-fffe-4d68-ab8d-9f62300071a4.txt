My mom blacked out on Christmas Eve
For a little context, my mom has been a high functionning alcoholic for the past 10 years, but her drinking has worsened in the past year. She would not only start drinking during the afternoon, I would wake up at 9 or 10 am and find a glass of wine on the counter. She also began to black out from her drinking sessions and had to be admitted at the hospital for heart malfunctions. She had to admit her drinking problems for the first time, since she got some help from the hospital staff. I was away for college for several months, so I didn’t follow her progression and thought she was doing better, but she wasn’t.

See, my mom drinks wine and uses most of her time to watch tv to cope with her anxiety. For Christmas Eve, she insisted on receiving or small family for our usual gathering. We proposed to have a potluck instead of making her cook, since we knew it would be a stressing factor. She still planned a whole dinner, which is nice in theory, but just stressed her out to the point that she drank all afternoon and blacked out before dinner, and couldn’t finish the recipe. My sisters and brothers did the rest. She joined us when she woke up a while later, but had to go back to bed again. She was gone for several hours and we had to say to our grand parents that she was just tired when they arrived.

I was honestly stressed out the whole time and couldn’t enjoy the time around the rest of my family. It’s the first time that she is that bad on Christmas Eve. She is not as bad as some other parents in other posts on this group, but I still feel betrayed, but also just neutral, like I can’t give a shit anymore. I feel like I could cut ties with my parents if it wasn’t for their financial support, but I’m stuck with them, and my mom seems like she will never get better.
