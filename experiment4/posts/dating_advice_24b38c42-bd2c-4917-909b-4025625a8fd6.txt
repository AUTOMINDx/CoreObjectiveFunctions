Unpopular Dating Opinion: Straight Men of Reddit, You Don't Lose Good Relationships By Being Vulnerable With Your Girlfriend, You End Up In Bad Relationships By Not Being Vulnerable With Her From The Start
This isn't unpopular to the general public, but across Reddit, it's definitely unpopular. Go on to any [r/askmen](https://www.reddit.com/r/askmen/) thread and you'll see the highest upvoted answer to questions about being vulnerable in relationships being some variant of "I'm not vulnerable with my girlfriend if she sees me cry she'll lose respect/attraction for me" or "that's stuff I talk to my therapist with, not my girlfriend." I view this as an extremely toxic warped view of the way the average straight woman views the man she is dating.

Lots of men have had one bad experience in dating, or heard an anecdotal story about how a guy showed emotion in a relationship and was promptly cheated on. I know of one popular story where a cop cried in front of his girlfriend when his mom died, and she lost attraction and proceeded to cheat on him with his friends. And a lot of guys hear this and think "I need to not show emotion/vulnerability around my girlfriend, or she'll leave me." This is where I think otherwise. If you're dating a girl who'd lose attraction and cheat on you because you show understandable emotion about a difficult life moment, then that's not a relationship you want to save. She is not a worthy partner for you. It's good that you found out who she is, and can dump her like she deserves.

In fact, I'd posit that not showing vulnerability up until a major life tragedy was the reason you ended up in this situation to begin with. By not showing vulnerability in the early stages of a relationship, you're going to lose a lot of women who like deeper emotional connections. The ones you have left are going to be ones who don't want emotional men. It's rare to find a woman who wants a completely hardened emotionless man. Most women value emotional intelligence, honesty, &amp; vulnerability, especially modern, successful, independent women. If you're never vulnerable, that sort of girl will never want to date you, and all that's left in your dating pool are disloyal women who only care about their own perception of your masculinity. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
