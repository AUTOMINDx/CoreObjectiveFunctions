Has anyone considered crashing their car on the way to work instead of facing another shitty day in the office/warehouse/shop etc.?
I had this feeling years ago, fortunately now I would never consider doing it. I don't mean suicidal thoughts - just something to get some down time.

Recently a co-worker was complaining, and said exactly the same thing. It was the first time anyone had vocalised it, and really resonated with me, as it was almost word for word how I had felt - just wondering how common it is.
