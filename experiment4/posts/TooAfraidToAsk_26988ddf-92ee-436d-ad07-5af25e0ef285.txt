Will the pain end at some point?
This is my first post on reddit and first time talking about what happened please forgive my formatting, any tips will be appreciated. About 3 years ago my son was staying at my mothers house for the weekend. He spent a weekend there at least once a month. This time, however, I got a phone call from my wife when she had gotten there to pick him up. "He's gone." is all she said. After calling her back, my mom, my dad, my sisters, and no one answered my calls. I rushed over there, blowing through red lights and just hoping I didn't get pulled over. When I got there I had to push my way past the police officers to find my son laying motionless, staring off into the abyss. Deceased, I've lived that memory every time I think about him. That's when the chest pains started. Sharp pains pierced my heart every waking moment from first sight. Then, the funeral. After the service, my wife said, "You need to leave, like, for a while. I can't deal with this with you, you're a mirror image of him." Fast forward to 6 months ago. I haven't seen or heard from my wife since that day. I actually got a call from my sister in law. "Hey Anon, she took her own life last night. Now, the same chest pains pair with dizziness and loss of breathing whenever I'm even reminded of my home. I don't know what Im supposed to do but the thought of "getting over it" is incredibly scary to me. I don't want to let go of the memories.
