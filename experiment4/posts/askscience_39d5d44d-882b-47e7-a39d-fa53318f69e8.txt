Do individuals who appear older or younger than their biological age live a shorter or longer lifespan, respectively?
I understand there are various confounding variables (ex. those appearing older than stated age may smoke, drink, have a poorly balanced diet, etc.) but if those factors are controlled as much as possible, is there a correlation between appearing age and life expectancy?
