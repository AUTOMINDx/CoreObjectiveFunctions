What physical health issues do you have?
I was wondering what physical health issues that you have that you believe may be triggered by chronic stress from being an ACOA.

I have intestinal issues, and chronic hemmorhoids, fissures.  Nausea, headaches, body pain, panic attacks starting as early as 3 years-old, and spanning into adulthood.  I was hospitalized for sudden-onset bulimia twenty years ago.  Thankfully, I was able to be abstinent within two years.  I see/have seen a physician for all health issues.

Some of it is attributed to another condition that I have, but wondering if some of it is not.
