Have you heard of someone who's been at a company 3 times and has left twice?
I know someone who has done this

- They worked at a company for 6 months and then got laid off

- 6 months later the same company hired him back again

- he works at the company for a year and a half. Then he leaves the company to go to another company 

- 6 months later he applies to the same company again for a position 


I would think that's pretty crazy if the company hired him back a third time. Am I wrong?
