Why is medieval history so full of misconceptions and myths that still linger on despite its vast popularity amongst the mainstream population and large amounts of research about the era, and/or its inspiration for many works of fiction?
This begs the question why is medieval history so full of misconceptions and myths despite its popularity and/or its inspiration of many works of fiction as a large portion of the medieval era is passed down by the use of popular myths or classical fables like the archetype of the honourable knight and the Crusades, the myth of King Arthur, the popularity of the use of the Medieval Era as a theme or a source of inspiration in several works of fiction like Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings and the Witcher.

There is a lot of romanticism and interest about the era but there are also misconceptions that still linger on.

Some of these are ones that I was not aware of until later on such as the reoccurring theme that the Medieval era was less advanced than the classical era during the time of the Western Roman Empire, or that the Medieval era is rather filthy and gloomy compared to other eras, or how actually honourable or dishonourable the knights were or the vast number of different types of samurai or the brutal lifestyles and deeds that they did in the name of honour and carrying the art of the war.

I keep on noticing that these themes still exist and I am curious why this is the case
