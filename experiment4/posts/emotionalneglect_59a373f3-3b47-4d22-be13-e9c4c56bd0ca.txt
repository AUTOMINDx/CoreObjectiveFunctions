DAE experience their parents berating them when they make a mistake.
Today, I got a workplace accident and it was kinda minor with my big toe being hurt. I was sent home and my dad first thing when saw it said things like "why you never take care of yourself in there" and " must be more careful". Not once did he inquire about whether I was feeling okay and then proceeded to ask if there was insurance.

It's just I wish for a simple "are you okay". I probably would say I am okay just to not seem vulnerable but is it that hard to ask.
