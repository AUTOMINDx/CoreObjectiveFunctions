AITA for telling my former boss why I quit
I (f17) used to babysit for Daniel (6) and Katie (4) from 5-9 every Monday-Wednesday for $25 an hour. Daniel’s and Katie’s parents are good friends with my parents.

While the pay was great, this job was very hard. Both kids are very babied and neither of them are fully potty trained, they can’t get dressed by themselves, they fight all the time, and they throw tantrums all the time. I’ve been secretly looking for other jobs for a while now.

I found a job from 4-8 every Monday-Thursday babysitting 3 kids (2f, 3f, and 5m) making $30 an hour.

I babysat for them last Saturday as a trial run and it was incredibly easy. All of the kids are potty trained, they’re not picky eaters, they can get themselves dressed, they were extremely well behaved, and when I put them in bed, they all stayed in bed (this never happens with Daniel and Katie). 

I decided to quit and took the job with the 3 kids. At first when Daniel and Katie’s parents asked why I quit, I said it was because they offered more per hour and an extra day a week. They offered to pay me $500 a week because their kids don’t like other babysitters.

I still said no and when they asked why I said it was because their kids behave horribly and can’t do anything for themselves (in nicer terms).

They told my parents and, while they agreed with everything I said, they don’t think I should’ve criticized their parenting choices.
