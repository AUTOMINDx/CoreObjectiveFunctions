29M I don't know what to do and hate any and all physical labor jobs. Passions make no money.
I don't know what to say, I have a ton of willingness but no idea how to go about it and constantly scared of over exerting my resources.

I want so badly to go to school but I have no idea how to make plans to go about it, I work a full time job that I hate but I also don't know where else to go. It litterally eats up all my time during the week.

I worked in the mental health field for 8 years and thought it was depressing and never want to go back, I now work as a phlebotomist because I wanted to learn a new skill for free.

Well I learned the skill but my passion for it has dried up and its a dead end job.

I like being able to think about what I am doing, doing mindless physical labor just makes me depressed.

No matter how I try to run from it or tell myself its immature, I desperately want some sort of creative job but I don't have any creative skills. I also have an interest in coding but only for creative ventures such as games.

I desperately wish I had someone to invest in me or was some sort of career guidance, I just don't know what to do with my team or how to chase any goals while working a full time job.

I tried to find career coaches but none of them sounded like the fit anything I was trying to do and that it was a financial risk for me, double so because it could be a huge waste of time since I am not currently in the field or have much time to do anything.

If its worth noting I have clinical depression and also no time to see a therapist.
