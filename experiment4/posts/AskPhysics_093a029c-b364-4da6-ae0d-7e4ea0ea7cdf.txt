What are the limits of orbital stability for a Double Planet?
I'm wondering how things would work if instead of Luna we had another earth-sized planet orbiting us. I assume it would have to be significantly further from earth than the moon to keep ocean tides from drowning everything. 
How separated could the double planets be and still remain in a stable orbit around the sun? (where stable implies sticking around for a billion years(?))

It feels like there's a point where a double planet's orbit has to be treated as a 3-body problem, but that doesn't seem to apply to earth-moon, so where is it?
