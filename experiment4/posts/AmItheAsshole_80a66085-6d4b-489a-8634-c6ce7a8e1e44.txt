AITA - I hate the xmas gifts I get from my partner, even though I “asked” for them
I (30f) am currently in a fight about this with my partner (35m). 
We’ve been together for about four years now, and a version of this conversation seems to happen a couple times a year. It always, *always* goes like this:


Him: what do you want for Xmas?

Me: *gives specific answer*

Him: cool, send me a link.

Me: *sends link*

Him: you know, I have an old one of those I could fix up for you instead.

Me: Well… I really like *this* one because of the color / shape / size/ matches my stuff / have already done the research / etc.,  and I was thinking of getting it for myself anyway; you don’t really have to.

Him: But I could just give you this one, that’s sitting here unused. 


I should mention that we both have well paying jobs, and are childfree. We split bills and mortgage and have savings. We’re not rich, but money has not been an issue; we are fortunate. We can do ‘nice’ things like eat take out or go on a small vacation every once in a while. And we communicate well; he admits he needs guidance thinking of gift ideas for people. 

I usually give in because I don’t want to seem wasteful or spoiled. I don’t need any gifts from him at all, but he always insists for bdays and xmas so I try to be honest and name something I would actually use that’s not too expensive, so it’s easy for him. But he always gets me a hand-me-down, thrifted, imitation brand or jerry-rigged version. One year I pointed out a $75 used bike in a shop. He gave me his old bike. (He’s 6’5”.  I’m 5’4”.) Last year I asked for a hot stone massage at a spa, he gave me some massage oil and a ‘coupon’ for a massage from him. How can I say no to that without sounding ungrateful? (It was lovely, but it was not a real massage, lol.)

So now, just this evening he asked again.
Me: Well, I have been browsing a new tent for camping this summer - a dome one so we don’t have to stoop inside as much when we—

Him: Oh cool! My dad has a tent he doesn’t use anymore!

Me: … … Is it a dome tent?

Him: (laughing) no, it’s his old army tent—

Me: (exploding) why even ask me what I want if it doesn’t matter what I actually want - sometimes I just want what I want!

Him: Whooooa, you should hear yourself, ‘I want, I want!’ (backs away with his hands up)


I’m sitting in our room alone feeling like a selfish asshole while he Calls all of the Duties downstairs. He plays that when he’s pissed.


**UPDATE:** 
*I have found and purchased a copy of Orc Slayer.* 

Not sure how to deliver this to him in the most effective way (and selfishly, the most entertaining way for me. I had a shitty night.) 

He slept downstairs in the living room last night and went to work this morning. I didn’t wake up when he came in the bedroom to get ready, so I woke up to an empty house and a bunch of really supportive comments — thank you all so much. ~~I’ll show him some of them and see what he thinks.~~ We usually have good conversations about other differences of opinion, it’s really just this stupid “him getting me stuff I don’t want” issue that has been a consistent problem. And because it’s the only real disagreement we have, I have always felt really privileged and spoiled to be upset about it. So thank you for showing me that it’s okay to “want what I want.” 

**ONE MORE THING** 
*I just bought myself the dome tent! I selected the gift wrapping and added a note that it was from Santa. I’m so excited!!!!!* Thank you all so so so so much for giving me the push to do it!  

I’ll post an another, real update after xmas.
