Gf's best friend (27m) is in love with her
We have been dating for around 4 months now and I have met him a grand total of two times, but I am sure he loves her. The way he hangs on to what she says, looks at her and is always willing to cancel his own programs if she asks are clear indicators of his feelings. They met while in college, dated for 6 months and then decided that they are better off as friends.

The clearest proof I got was yesterday. We went to an Indian restaurant and ordered fish, and dude spent his whole time cutting her fish into smaller portions so that she can eat it easily. Sure you do that for your friends, but he didnt do the same for his own gf, who was also having difficulty in eating fish. At one point my eyes met that of his gf and she looked so defeated, it was sad. I cant even imagine what she must be going through when your bf of 3 years completely ignores you. Now, I have decided to break up as I dont want to compete with him, life is complicated enough without me taking on additional complications. But my question to you guys is, should I tell my gf that her best friend of 8 years is in love with her or just let it be?
