Funny: How has engineering changed your everyday vocabulary?
I'm a Mechanical Engineer and I can tell y'all that a lot of engineering terms are a part of my general vocabulary. Like when I'm talking about investments with my engineer friends, we talk about "entropy" of investments e.g. cash is low entropy, assets are high entropy.

But I noticed a funny piece of engineering vocabulary today. My dad's a chemical engineer and he's currently having some trouble with Sulphur flushing at his power plant. This basically means that filtered Sulphur has solidified and choked something. Today he was driving when I was sitting shotgun and some idiot coming wrong way stuck his car blocking the traffic and my dad was just yelling in the car, "Fucking Sulphur ass person" and I was laughing like hell even though it's not funny for anyone who doesn't know how annoying Sulfuric choking is for equipment.
