If Betelgeuse exploded, would it kill astronauts?
In early 2020 (just before covid-19 broke out of control and lockdowns were set everywhere), Betelgeuse was at ~40% it's normal brightness and we were waiting if it explodes ðŸ’¥ as a supernova.

The internet says if it exploded, it would be xtremely bright (like a 50% Moon), but safe with Earth's atmosphere blocking light in dangerous wavelengths.
But would ISS crew (or possible astronauts on Moon/Mars/etc. or on their way there) get a deadly dose of radiation?
And if it's dangerous, would we get an early warning hours/days before boom and evacuate ISS crew?
