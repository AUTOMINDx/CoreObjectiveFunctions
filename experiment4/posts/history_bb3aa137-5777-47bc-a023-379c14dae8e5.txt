Why do different cultures across the world have dragons?
I know this is a question better meant for the mythology sub reddit but I feel like the answer would be rooted in the country's history.  Even with the endless variations of language and culture that people have created — not to mention every possible type of landscape and climate they’ve called home — time and again, our ancestors have conjured up the myth of the dragon which is really bizarre to me. Sure, there are differences per dragon, Chinese dragons are really long and smart, European ones are buff and angry but where did this imagery of dragons come from?
