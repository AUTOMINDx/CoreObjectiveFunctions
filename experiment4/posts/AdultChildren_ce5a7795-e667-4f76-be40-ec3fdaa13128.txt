Have you ever been told you are overly responsible?
I just found this subreddit, and I am processing my identification with this. I hope this post doesn't seem like a gloat. 

  
I gained a great sense of community at my workplace this year, and was surprised to get the look at myself that I've gotten through other people's observations. I am the youngest person at my workplace (early 20's), and I get along with most of my coworkers. I have the most responsibilities, and wear lots of hats. I go above and beyond, and I take a lot of pride in what I do. It's a lot of work, but I feel really lucky and it's working out well for where I am with my degree.

Over the last year, I've been told on numerous occasions that I am the "most responsible person" a coworker has ever known for my age. Another said I take much more responsibility (personality-wise) than I have to. I was honestly surprised to hear these things, as I was somewhat disastrous and immature a few years ago. I am an only child, and I've never had to look out for a sibling.

My alcoholic dad has never been angry while drunk - it is always when he is sober - he dismisses, controls, ignores. He's definitely mellowed out with age and isn't the same irritable dad that would take his anger out on me sober when he got home from work, but I have a lot of memories walking on eggshells around "sober" him, and then feeling irritated by his stupidity when he starts drinking for the night. 

I guess it's just surprising to see that I exhibit these behaviors even under "better" circumstances than many of the stories I've briefly read here.
