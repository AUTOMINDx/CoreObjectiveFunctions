It's not my fault you didn't plan
Reposted from r/childfree. They said it would fit here.

So Saturday shifts are a bonus at my work. You sign up for them months in advance. My coworker is usually the last person to sign up (her choice) and takes all the shitty days and then tries to switch for the better ones because "she has no one to watch the kids".........who are twenager. You can see where this is going. 

I work this Saturday. She started yesterday with trying to tell me I work too much and I need the day off. I'm like ya no i have bills to pay I need the money. "But it's the last shift before Christmas and I still need to pay for the kids gifts". 

OK Karen how is that my fault? Now she's trying to say its going to snow so I shouldn't drive and she'll take my shift. 

Apparently she didn't plan for Christmas and is now trying to get every shift so she can pay off the loads she bought the kids. Her favorite thing to go to is that I don't have kids and don't need the money. OK but I have a dog who likes fancy things. I need to afford him the life of luxury that he's become accustomed to. 

Just because I don't have kids doesn't mean I don't have bills to pay. And it also doesn't mean that I don't have wants and needs. There is more to life than being a mother who doesn't let her kids lift a finger and then complains they don't do anything. 

Thank you for letting me vent but I'm so annoyed. I planned these weekends in advance knew I'd want that time for this reason! Like it's Christmas I have nieces and nephews I need to buy for. I wanted to not have that huge burden on me so I planned! 

Your lack of planning doesn't constitute an emergency on my part.

Edit because I forgot the dog tax https://www.reddit.com/user/emmyhc/comments/rhugy1/the_fanciest_pup/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
