I am 22 and I have no friends and it’s starting to get to me
So I’m just ranting hoping someone can help. I had friends in high school but after leaving for university I lost touch with everyone. I made friends whose numbers I have there but I don’t ever see them. I completed uni and now work but I have no friends who I hang out with out of work. They are all way older than me and have kids etc their not the type to wanna hang out with someone who looks like a high school kid. I used to not mind it as I loved hanging out with my family and staying at home but since covid it’s really gotten to me. I feel really low and don’t know what to do. I really want friends who wanna hang out or who I can even help and build memories with. Please help. I feel so bored and alone
