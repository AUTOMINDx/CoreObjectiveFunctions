I just wanna vent
My mom has been a heavy drinker since I was about 12 years old (I’m 20 now.) I don’t really know what changed but now as far as I can remember shes been an alcoholic. I didn’t realize she was an alcoholic until talking to someone in high school whos parent had recovered from alcoholism. I spent my childhood finding beer cans hidden everywhere, my mom did (and still does) stumble into my room drunk every night and won’t leave me alone. She also starves herself and is bulimic and I feel like her caretaker. But now I resent her. I get so mad when she comes in my room and then I feel so guilty bc she thinks I hate her. It just kills me to be around her. My family has so many problems and is so dysfunctional I can’t even begin to name it. I am tired of being her caretaker or the only one to consider her wellbeing. I want to move out but I’m scared to leave her. I’m angry she put me in such a difficult position. Why can’t she be the parent? I have never seen her as a parental role for me. I have soooo much anger toward my family and I don’t know how to overcome it. I constantly dream of saying things I wish I could say to them in real life. Oh well.
