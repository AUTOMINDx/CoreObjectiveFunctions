Worth of stone age tools (in neolithic/bronze age era)
I've studied archaeology for several years and for some time I have  been knapping simple flint tools as a hobby. I was looking through some  old publications today and the question came to my mind: are we able to  determine the potential value of flint and stone tools at a time of  their popularity? We undoubtedly know that in the early Bronze Age,  metal was a prestigious commodity, as evidenced by the grave gifts. I  also read another publication in which it was reported that in 19th  century New Guinea, stone adze could be exchanged for livestock. Maybe  some of you accidentally found an article that deals with this topic? It  seems to me that a detailed comparative analysis of artefacts from  graves and flint workshops could be a good lead.
