Who Are All The Most Essential Cultural Anthropologists That Every Advanced Student Should Read and Know?
After finishing off school I plan on dedicating a year to reading cultural anthropology's lineage. Y'know I'll read the old guys to the most influential newer guys and that will be a monster task. I suspect reading one book per major character will be the way to go but Im open to suggestions.

For example, Clifford Geertz - The Interpretation of Cultures is on my list. Franz Boas and Margaret Mead is too but I have yet to file out a long comprehensive lists of major names and their major works and to learn their major concepts. 

I hope to read them all and gain an opinion and understanding of how I may like to pursue research of my own style and learn the important terms/concepts for possibly pursuing higher education in the future or at the very least learn something new and hopefully relevant. 

What can you recommend to a budding student?

Thank you
