Always being used
Last 2 relationships were with people that had low self esteem. I helped both of these girls to get out of their shells and see how beautiful they were. As soon as they did, they walked out the door.

Both times I was left in a deep depression. And they did not care.

One could say u should have learned my lesson the first time. But I just didn't think this girl would be anything like the previous one. Yet she was.
Now can I say if the next person needs help won't help them? My therapist says I should care more about myself and not put myself in such situations, but idk what to do. I guess I'm just a caring person and fall for people that are unloved and don't love themselves.

So tired of being used and whenever I need someone to help me, there's no one around.
