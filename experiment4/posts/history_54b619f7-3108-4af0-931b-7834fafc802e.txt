Eunuchs role in Ancient China / how did they obtain so much power over the court?
How did Eunuchs in ancient China end up having so much power over the empire?

I am a westerner and just starting to explore Chinese history (it’s like game of thrones turned up to 11) and I’m a little confused as to the role of Eunuchs in China’s court. I read some books saying that they controlled the court and emperor and I’m just curious how they managed this?

Did they self castrate?

How did they obtain so much power?

What exactly was their role in the kingdoms?
