Reminiscing on "the good old days (pre anxiety)" and thinking I took it for granted...who else thinks this way
I often play in my head what my life was like before I had crippling anxiety and how I took it for granted. it's completely unfair to myself as I would have never imagined that my mental health would plummet like this but still find myself constantly reminscing on old times from age 17 prior (currently 23) which includes looking at old pictures on my camera roll, enjoying a vacation, being a competitive HS athlete, getting good grades, etc.
