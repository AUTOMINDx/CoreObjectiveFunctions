Moving for dream job; partner doesn't want to go
I (38f) have been offered a dream job in another state and I'm going to accept. My longtime partner (35m) does not want to move. He says he'll move when our kids (not shared) are done with school. I cannot wait that long!

The thing is... he knows I do not want to stay here. I have been working toward getting a job elsewhere for some time, because I am vocally NOT INTO the place we currently live. Maybe he thought I couldn't do it. But I want to go. It's a life changing amount of money and elevated job status. Not to mention the change in location I've been dying for.

I know I need to ask him to come. But I'm worried he's going to sabotage everything by hating me for moving us. He is not as advanced in his career as I am, and I'm afraid he's envious of me. At any rate, I doubt he will ever agree to come, because he's always said no to leaving. I need to be able to do my job when I get there, not deal with jealousy every day. This is breaking my heart.

What can I do?
