My mother cares more about money
I got a snake just over a year ago and I love him dearly. He is adorable!

Recently he's been quite sick so we (my dad and I) took him to the vets. Turns out that he has a life threatening infection that doesn't have a treatment that is guaranteed to work. This was not due to my husbandry, but he had it when we got him but it only showed now.

We came back home and my mother walks into my room and asks about the visit. I tell her everything including the infection.

She isn't that close to the snake as it is mine, but as soon as I finish, she keeps hounding me about how much the visit costs. This went for some time. I told her I don't know how much it cost because my dad paid for it so she went to him.

She found out and came back up and started getting mad that it cost that much. I had just found out my snake has a high chance of dying. She's been snappy with me and has made jokes and comments about it too.

I just needed to get this off my chest, it's driving me insane.

EDIT: Since a lot of people are telling me to pay my parents back or asking why I didn't think of veterinary stuff before etc. I was a minor when we got him and we did discuss in depth. I pay for everything except for when we initially bought him and this one vet visit.

EDIT 2: They do not expect me to pay this bill back.
