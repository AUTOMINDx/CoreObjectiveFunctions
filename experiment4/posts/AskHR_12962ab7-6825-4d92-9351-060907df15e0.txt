[NY] My former employer refuses to provide me with a pay stub. Can I sue him for that?
Hello there!

I know that it is not the best place to ask for legal advice. But I have no other option left on the table. Besides, I'm so fuckin mad at my boss that I have no idea what I should do in my case. I'm sorry for the harsh words, but I just dunno how to express all the bullshit my boss did to me.

The issue is that I've been working at one company for 5 years. I'm talking now specifically about my former employer. I never got a raise and was fed up with false promises that if I worked hard the next month, I would get a raise or a significant bonus. In the whole 5 years, I never got a big bonus or a raise. In the beginning, I understood that they had some financial problems and had to cut a lot of jobs. I was trying to be loyal and didn't leave them during the difficult period. I expected that my boss would appreciate this gesture and all my effort to help them to recover. But, he simply forgot all the kind things I did for that company.

Later, my flatmate told me that he wanted to move out of our place and rent a flat with his GF. Well, I understand that, and I can't stop him from being happy. But, on the other hand, I can't afford to rent this place by myself. I don't wanna get another flatmate either and adjust to his living habits. So, I started to look for a one-bedroom flat or a studio. Besides, I found a couple of options and almost signed a lease agreement with one landlord.

Another issue is that I started job hunting too. Each potential employer asks for a pay stub from my last place. But this bastard — my boss, doesn't want to give one. I tried to convince and threaten him, but he just laughed in my face, like I had no other option except for working for him for the rest of my life. I tried to find a solution and found this online service — [https://www.thepaystubs.com/](https://www.thepaystubs.com/). But I suppose this pay stub needs to be signed by my stupid boss, or can I submit an unsigned pay stub?

I know that there are so many questions, but I'm desperate...
