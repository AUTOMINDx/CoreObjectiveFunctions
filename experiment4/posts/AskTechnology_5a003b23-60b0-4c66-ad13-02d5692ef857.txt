How do I fix whatever mess-up I caused with this computer?
So this morning about 3 am the roof of my apartment caved in. I rescued what stuff I could by shoving everything in a giant bin and heading to my parents house while I wait for repairs. Apparently, the unopened bottle of Kahlua in that bin broke and then soaked nothing except specifically my laptop and cellphone.

I know what to do about the cell phone. Put it in rice and wait. I got all the Kahlua off the outside of this laptop that I could, turned it off, and left it alone for about 8 hours. On turning it on, it seems to work just fine-- keyboard's a little sticky and it smells like Kahlua and something vaguely burning (although that could be something else.) A few pop-ups and my mic isn't working, but again, that could be something else.

I'm not used to fancy laptops like this-- I used to get the used ones that lasted like 2 years even if you smacked them with a hammer or threw them off a building. But this is also the best laptop I've ever had and I'd like it to keep that way-- so what can I do? I have like 0 technical knowledge. I can't take it apart like every tutorial says, and I certainly can't put it back together. IDK what to do.
