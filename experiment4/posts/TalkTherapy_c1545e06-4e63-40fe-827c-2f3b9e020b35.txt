Seeing therapist’s bed fucked me up
I do a mix of telehealth and in person with my T. She is almost always in her office but a few times has been at home. Behind her at home is nothing but a blank wall and part of a bookshelf. This past time, she was very obviously in her bedroom. Behind her I saw her king size bed, dresser, tv, decorations etc. I also saw her husband outside through a door. At first I thought it was pretty cool and I liked that she felt comfortable with me. Then in the days that followed session, it has really fucked with my mind. In the past, when I would picture her sleeping, it was a fictional place. Now I know exactly where she’s sleeping. What her comforter looks like. What she’s seeing. I know where she has sex. I can picture her on that bed. It almost like I got too much of a picture in my mind of her. One that I thought I would really appreciate but  instead it’s giving me just weird feelings. I am thinking about her more. I feel connected to her more. I miss her more this week. I wonder how much is attributed to the stretched boundary.
