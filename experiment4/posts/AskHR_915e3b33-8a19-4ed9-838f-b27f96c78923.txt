[NJ] Grounds for termination for someone looking at a second job?
Hi guys—Here’s my question 

I currently work two jobs one at a huge company’s (full time) and one at McDonalds (weekends) to make ends meet.

I find that the McDonald’s job isn’t the best and am trying to find new part time  gig that will make sense on my resume.

I recently saw a post on LinkedIn and said interested for a job in the same field.

I wake up to notifications this morning stating me to have a meeting with management. During the zoom meeting management shows a message from someone with a screenshot of my post that was sent to them. Idk who screenshot it, but they were pissed and asked why I’m looking for work and what is happening.

I said the truth I work two jobs and need the second job in my field and they said ok and the meeting ended.

I’m terrified of getting fired I read even looking for a new job for at will hired employees are grounds for termination.

What do I do? I’m thinking of getting my part time job to verify my employment through a letter and sending it to my company, just to say hey I really do work two jobs.

Please let me know what you think.

I appreciate y’all
