Should I stop saying I was emotionally neglected since my parents didnt call me a piece of shit?
It seems like to have emotional neglect and CPTSD you need to have had your parents call you names (which mine did but not outside of jokes) and they need to call you useless. Mine didnt do that they just were never there emotionally and always told me to not complain and whine, so I feel like it's not traumatic enough and I should leave this sub for people who have real problems.
