I (51f) went to make dinner that we agreed on. Partner (48m) ends up angry that the mac and cheese is lacking ham.
I am tired. I hate food.  I hate figuring out meals. I hate dining out.  

Back story.  5 months I have had some pain and issues. Been rough getting it sorted, but looks like there's finally a light at the end of the tunnel. In the interim, I'm at a 5 to 6 pain wise every day. Simply exhausting.   So gourmet food isn't my priority. 

My partner and i agreed to have a quick throw it in the oven back up meal today. He thought it had ham in it.  Turns out it didn't.  He asked randomly as I'm putting it in the oven if i want to make something more complex. I said no. I'm tired. 

Ensue the agruement because I didn't mention the frozen mac n cheese was hamless.  It isn't proper dinner food because there is no ham.  Jeezus.  I offered to cook and add bacon...  his idea, Don't want to take any credit. 

So now he went to bed.  Mac n cheeze is back in the freezer and I'm just frustrated.  Not sure what the hell to do, but this happens often.

TLDR: partner is mad because agreed on dinner is just mac and cheese, no ham...
