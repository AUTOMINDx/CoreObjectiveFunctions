Went about expected, but im doing okay...
Came out to my brother, father, and then mother in that order. And as we go down the line the responses got worse and worse. For reference I recently moved out and started transitioning. They are all religious Christians who think lgbtq+ stuff is sinful, although my brother is less vocal and less judgey. He took it fine and went as far as to call me his sister. My dad appalogized for my past pains and said he'd pray for guidance on how to love and encourage me going forward. And then my mom went and ruined it all. Like I know my dad doesn't approve of my lifestyle choices, but he's clearly not going to be rude about it. But my mom basically didn't respond, and when I asked her if she had questions or needed time to process things first she said "Nothing to process you're my son and I will still call you [Deadname]." I told her that's rude and I don't want to talk to her as long as she treats me like that. She responded by saying "Why is calling you my son and calling your name disrespectful?" I explained it means you don't care and are acting like this conversation never happened. She tried to call me twice but answered saying my name and claiming "in my mind you will always be my son [deadname], I can't change it, that's just how I am..." I just hung up and texted her we can talk tomorrow. 

I don't really need advice, I just felt like sharing my story and getting it out if my system, but ill still gladly listen to any you might have. For now though, im just going to give it time while not engaging with her if she's rude
