Never been this overwhelmed. Should I call in sick?
I have never felt this stressed in my entire life. My boss keeps putting me on for extra shifts when I have other shit to do. I have a 5000 word essay to write for Friday which it appears that I’m not going to get done as I don’t have the motivation to get out of bed. All I want to do is sleep and get high but I know it’s terrible for me and I start to get anxious when I don’t get what I need to do done. Is it possible to get 5000 words done in 3 days??? Should I call in sick to work tomorrow? I hate the fact I leave everything to the last minute as well and then everything goes wrong!!!

Update: Got 1300 words done so far, the goal is 1000 more tomorrow then 1500 Thursday and Friday. Thanks for the comments!! Decided I’m going to phone in sick tomorrow!!
