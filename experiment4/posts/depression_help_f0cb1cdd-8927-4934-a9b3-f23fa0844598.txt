I'm not suicidal
I'm not suicidal, I just want to die.
The world has killed my spirit, and the glimmer in my eye.
I'm not suicidal, I just don't want to live.
Not strong enough to fight no more, I have no more to give.

People, family, politics, is all too much for me.
Been let down too many times there's no more hope I see.
Can't be the only one to have to stand up for myself.
My lovers, friends and family, just toss me on a shelf. 
Out of sight and out of mind, I cease to exist.
It's easier for everyone, I'm simply never missed.
I feel inconsequential, like I'm struggling for naught.
I have no more motivation after all the wars I've fought. 

I'm not suicidal, I just want to die.
Can't stand to struggle anymore, I just can't stand to cry.
I'm not suicidal, I just don't want to live.
Not strong enough to fight no more, I have nothing left to give
