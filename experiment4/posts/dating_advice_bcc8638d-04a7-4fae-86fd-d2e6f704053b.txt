is it a red flag if a guy jokingly asks for nudes on your first actual conversation?
i’m f(23) he’s m (early 30s). friends say it’s a red flag. i guess i just want to give him the benefit of the doubt 🤷🏻‍♀️ thoughts?

Edit: Thank you to everyone who answered (and even messaged me). I really appreciate it. I have problems with dating (I usually date older men since I was 15, but I’m already working on this thru therapy).

He insisted on calling me to apologize, and that what he did made him really guilty, and we tried to talk things out. I forgave him. Again, thanks for everyone’s comments! But I think I’ll observe his behavior for a while. Another red flag or anything like this and I’m cutting him off for good. This may sound dumb but after so much trashy relationships I’m just…. really trying to be optimistic for now (while setting boundaries, of course).

Edit 2 lol: thanks for all the comments, i’m trying to read all of em!!! i’ll definitely keep all of this in mind.

Update: I cut him off 😂 thanks everyone 😎
