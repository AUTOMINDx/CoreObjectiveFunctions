What did I do?!
I’ve been suspicious for a while my family had a group chat that didn’t include me. I was on my moms computer tonight and she has it connected to the messages on her phone. It chimed a new message from my sibling. Curiosity got the better of me and as I started searching I discovered that both of my sisters had decided to “write me off” earlier this year. I haven’t spoken to them in months, but I honestly thought that’s when the breakdown began. So before then I mistakenly believed they’d been open to hearing me. Which wasn’t the case, instead of trying to communicate with me they were taking their hands off the wheel, so to speak. My chest is tight and there’s a pit in my stomach. I feel like a fool.
