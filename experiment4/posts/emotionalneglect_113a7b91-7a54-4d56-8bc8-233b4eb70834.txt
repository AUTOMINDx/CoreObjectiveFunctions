It's hard to integrate the emotional neglect as part of my history
Because I honestly don't think they meant to do it. They aren't bad people, but they just couldn't at the same time give me as I was growing what I needed. They couldn't offer me the safety, knowledge or resources I would've desperately needed. One of my parents became handicapped when I was just starting school and that sucked out a lot from them. My mom already had at least generational trauma and became depressed and she tbh even before didn't know how to be with me. My dad really tried to be both of my parents, but he just couldn't. After he became crippled practically our extended family stopped calling, stopped visiting, abandoned us. My dad gets really upset if I say him getting handicapped affected me a lot. It's still not a convo we can have. There are other genuine problems in our family dynamic, but I feel like a monster while in therapy talking about how something affected me, as a 9 year old, when put in context is perfectly reasonable why my parents weren't able to add up to the task. How can I integrate a feeling of complete abandonment with parents who didn't know any better or due to circumstances weren't able to provide. How can I accept that the way I was raised deeply affected me, while also not hating them. I'm not able to integrate this. I don't know how to. I just, it doesn't make sense to be left with crippling cPTSD, a whole litany of diagnoses. I just don't understand how I'll ever be whole.
