How to deal with downvote stalker? (sorry if this gets asked all the time)
How do I as an average redditor like myself outcompete an even more average redditor who's dedicated his spare time to take my valueless karma points?

Is there a bot or something that gets red flags when someone goes through a post history downvoting everything?

context: dude sulked about Asians in a city near Asia, gave him data about local Asians ratios. 

(I know you'll read this, so again I ask why your wasting your time to do this)

edit: Hi all. I am in in awe of how my question has progressed. I have read ALL the comments which has given me quite some happiness. they have all been insightful and/or helpful in their individual ways

I know a lot of people here love their pets so I have compiled a small number of photo's of my 13yo cat 'stumpy' and 3yo dog 'woofy' to give some happiness back

2nd edit. I've tried thanking everyone who gifted me rewards but I lost track and just want to say thanks again.

I will try and give you generous people more focused replies when I get the time in the coming days
