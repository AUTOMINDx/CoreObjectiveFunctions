Is it possible for therapy to make things worse?
Please hear me out before downvoting.

I Have been to many therapists, before deciding it's not for me. I have an overthinking mind (already take meds for it), so whatever I 'learned' in therapy, I ended up overthinking it, which made my condition even worse. For example, in therapy I discovered a lot of things about myself and became very self aware. Worst thing ever! Now every waking moment, I have to deal with that 'self-awareness'. It's exhausting! I'll be walking down the street and my mind will throw a 100 page thesis analyzing what I did (how i walked, what vibe i gave off, did i seem confident or not, was i staring too long at the pretty woman, etc, etc)..

Therapy rather than fixing my issues, made new issues..
