Do men honestly care about a girl’s weight?
Guys I need brutal honesty here. So I used to be a size 4/6 US size like 2 years ago (pre-covid). I’m 5ft 8inches and fairly okay looking in the face (not to sound big headed). During covid I broke up with my bf and I’ve put on a bit of weight and I am now a size 8/10 in clothing. So I’m a bit curvier and I am having serious anxiety about going on dates. Like I feel really not good in myself and feel guys preferred me when I was slimmer. I use to suffer from an eating disorder when I was a teen so I feel I do have body dysmorphia at times. My dad often says thinks like when are you going to the gym, you need to stick at it and my mum recommends diets etc. my family are super slim so I’ve been brought up like this. This guy I was seeing recently said his ex was almost anorexic and he’s was glad i was happy with my weight and I knew he meant it nicely but I was offended as I thought he was referring to me as being fat.

I am going to the gym now and I am aiming to lose some weight but I want to know if guys actually care about a girls weight or am I just over thinking it.
