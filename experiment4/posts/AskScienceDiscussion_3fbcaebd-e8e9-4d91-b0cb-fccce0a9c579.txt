Monkey upon Canine Revenge Attacks, Lavool, India
A revenge attack by a local band of monkeys upon dogs has been reported.  Apparently neighborhood dogs killed a baby monkey.  It is reported that the monkeys went on a rampage of community dog killing.

The kind of questions I have concerning such primate behavior are:

1.  Has the incident likely been exaggerated?  Might this be just an ongoing association where there are many ferral dogs in the village &amp; a few times a week monkeys grab a few dogs anyway?  
2.  If a particular monkey was not in attendance at the killing of the baby monkey, how does a species w/o language disseminate the message that a declaration of war has been declared against dogs?  
3. Could it be the monkeys are just angry and not a revenge attack but the dogs are just what happens to be a life form available at a non-threatening size?  
4. It is understandable that the monkeys present during the killing would attack the dogs in the moment.  The sustained thought behind a revenge attack toward a particular species I wouldn't expect.  Would a monkey recognize a Chihuahua &amp; an English Mastiff to be the same species?
