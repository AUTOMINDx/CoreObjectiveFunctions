Being Anxious and Hypervigilant is EXHAUSTING!!!
It is physically exhausting and I feel so so so tired. I need some kind of massage to soften all my tense muscles and tissue and I am so tired.

People never talk about how exhausting and how much energy it takes to be constantly on edge and worried and expecting the worst in EVERY situation.

I'm trying my best, but it feels like nothing, it feels like the bare minimum and I'm just tired!

End rant.
