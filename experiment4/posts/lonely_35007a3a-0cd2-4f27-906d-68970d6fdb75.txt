Couples
I cannot stand seeing happy couples. Not necessarily any couple, but the ones where they're close to each other or seemingly having a good time together. I don't even feel good hearing the words "girlfriend" or "boyfriend", even on the internet, because all it does is send strong feelings of envy straight to my heart as it's one of the things I've wanted most in life.

I just keep ignoring them to the best of my ability. Sorry if this post seems toxic, I just had to get that off my chest and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone I know personally in my life. Thank you.

Addendum: I don't hate them, rather I just get an automatic emotional response of envy when the topic comes up or I see them, as I mentioned, being close, lovey dovey, etc. I don't want the wrong message to come off here.

Addendum 2: Holy crap, didn't expect so many to feel this. Thank you guys for sharing your experiences, it really  helps me feel less alone. I will try to get back to as many of you as possible. Please, if you see any trolls - tell them why they're wrong then block/report them, but still be kind. If they have any sense of morality it will get to them, and by ignoring them they'll usually just go away.
