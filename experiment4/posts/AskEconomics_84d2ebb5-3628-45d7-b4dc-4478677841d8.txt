What is the expected economic impact of Santa's global distribution of toys made with magic and free elf labor?
I assume Santa uses magic to conjure up the materials needed to manufacture the various toys.  I also assume his elves work for free (maybe they get some room and board, but that too is provided via magic), and they can perform specialist tasks, like forging microchips for game systems, etc.  His reindeer also serve as a super efficient global distribution network, so he doesn't need to hire any deliverymen or procure any delivery services.  With all these presents being delivered to Christmas trees around the world without contributing anything at all to the global economy, what economic impacts can we expect?  Mass unemployment?  Commodity crashes? Deflationary pressure?  Inverted yield curves?  How bad is it going to be?
