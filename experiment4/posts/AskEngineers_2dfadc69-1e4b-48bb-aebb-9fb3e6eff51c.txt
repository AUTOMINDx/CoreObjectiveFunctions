AskEngineers: How Does One Check on Team Member Progress Correctly?
/edit

Should I ask my main supervisor about how to best do this, or would that be a bad idea? We are on good terms and everything, I'm just trying to learn.

What is the best way to go about checking in on team member process? I'm in charge of two engineers by reviewing their designs and answering their questions, etc.

During the holiday season things have been a little slow over the entire team.. like some of these things could be done in 2-3 days as opposed to the now... 2 weeks ish. BUT nobody is like upset or anything from higher up, kind of just how it goes during the holidays I guess.

What I'm trying to ask is how can I check in on these guys without being like over their shoulder type thing? Every time I have checked in in the past they are pretty short and one guy is even pretty snobby about it. And I know they aren't doing everything correctly, which is as expected being new, but they never ask questions..
