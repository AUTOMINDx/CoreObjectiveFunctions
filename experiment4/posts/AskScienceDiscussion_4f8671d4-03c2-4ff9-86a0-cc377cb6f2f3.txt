Do Chimps and Dolphins recognise Humans as intelligent?
Do Chimps, Gorillas, Orangutans, Dolphins and Orcas recognise us Humans as smart beings?

And do Orcas and Dolphins recognise eachother as smart, or do Chimps and Gorillas?

I once read that Orcas can communicate to some Dolphins (iirc it was an Orca learning to communicate with Bottlenose Dolphins) so it made me wonder how these animals view eachother and view us and if they recognise us and other smart animals as fellow intelligent life
