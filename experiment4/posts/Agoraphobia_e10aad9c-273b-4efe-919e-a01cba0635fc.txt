I went shopping in the city centre by myself today!!
I had a group therapy meeting and I was literally putting on my shoes to leave when they called and told me it had been cancelled. I knew if I stayed in I’d end up feeling like crap - especially because I was already up and ready and dressed - so I went into the city centre anyway and did some Christmas shopping/bought some things I’d been planning to buy online.

I was definitely anxious and had a few awkward moments because the shops are crowded in the run-up to Christmas, but I feel amazing now. I’m so proud of myself. Feeling a little less trapped inside now! I’m even thinking about implementing long walks to keep up my progress! 

Seems like such a dumb, minor thing to be proud of at the age of 25 but up til now if I tried to go into a shop on my own without my friends there as a crutch, I’d go in, look at one thing, panic and leave and go home. But today instead I got everything I needed and even had a decent time!
