Numbness = my survival strategy
As I'm learning about Childhood Emotional Neglect I'm realising just how much I have been suppressing my feeling and emotions. 

- Feeling absolutely miserable but having to grin and smile during the work meeting.
- feeling totally miserable and empty but telling everyone at the birthday party, wedding, family get-together that I'm doing great and I'm maybe just "a bit tired". 
- together with friends when one of them brings up a painfully humiliating incident from your past so he can tell "a funny story" - and I am expected to grin and laugh it off when I'm dying on the inside. 

I don't want to be the emotionally volatile crybaby that's too sensitive. I don't want to be the weird person with mental health problems. I don't want my family to worry about me. 

I can see the value in numbing my inner pain and presenting a strong happy face to the world. Its helped me survive. But now I'm wondering at what cost? I'm surviving but feeling dead inside.
