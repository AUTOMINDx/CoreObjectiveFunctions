Is it ok to have 2 therapists without telling them?
So I'm going to start out by saying I feel like I'm being really weird about this. I have a therapist who is awesome, who helped me through a really difficult time (coming out of the closet, alcohol issues, cutting contact with my physically/emotionally abusive family, suicidal thoughts, etc). He helped/helps me so much. I'm honestly uncomfortable about how dependent I am on him at this point. I've never depended on a person this much I think. It almost feels clingy, but he doesn't know that.

I've started seeing another therapist too- because I see Therapist 1 once every 2-3 weeks, and I figured I might need more help because I'm still feeling pretty down. Also I have insurance that covers it so why not. I just haven't told either therapist I have another therapist. I don't want either one to have the full story, if that makes sense. It does feel like Therapist 1 knows so much that it's deeply uncomfortable, but I can't cut him off completely because he helps so much.

Also I told a friend about the 2 therapists- hadn't really thought about it much, but she instantly started laughing and said, "THAT IS SO YOU to have 2 thearpists and not tell them." Basically I have a history of cheating on my ex gfs, and can be weirdly secretive, and she felt it's like I'm doing that but with therapists.

Is this ok? Is it detrimental to therapy/mental health to do this?
