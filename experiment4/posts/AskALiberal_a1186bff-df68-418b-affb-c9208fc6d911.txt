Now that BBB is dead, if you were asked to give a eulogy/toast at its funeral, what would you say?
Manchin confirms he is a no vote on BBB. [(The Guardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/19/joe-manchin-biden-build-back-better-no-fox-news)

Here's mine

"Here's to BBB. The bastard had the worst bodyguards. Ty to [CPC for giving up](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/06/1053239109/rep-pramila-jayapal-on-what-led-her-to-throw-support-behind-infrastructure-bill) all [leverage](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/nov/01/house-democrats-vote-infrastructure-reconciliation-bills-biden-us-politics-live). Ty to Biden for being incredibly good at shooting himself in the foot. Ty to corporatism for creating a very vulnerable economy. Ty to bat or petri dish that decided to f\*\*\* us all up, economically and biologically. Peace I'm out."
