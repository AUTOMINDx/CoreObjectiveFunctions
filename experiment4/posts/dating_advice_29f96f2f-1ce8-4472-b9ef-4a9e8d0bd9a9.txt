How do I stop being desperate for affection and attention from women?
I constantly want to be validated, touched, and told I’m attractive by women. I have weekly dreams about sex or romance, and it makes me depressed just as often. I want nothing more than a woman to give me attention and comfort me.

I know I have nothing to offer in return. I don’t deserve to be treated like that, which is obvious since I’ve never even gotten close. This has been destroying me for years, how do I stop?
