I’m so nervous for Christmas...
It’s my first Christmas this year without my Grandma after she passed away. I can’t deal with the thought of her not being there, and I’m not sure how I’m going to make it through. She was my best friend, and Christmas was always her day. I’m freaking out even just at the thought of that giant void staring me in the face all day, and I guess just anxious of feeling those unpleasant feelings. I’m anxious about the fact that I’m not going to be able to cope and how I’m going to react. My family doesn’t understand my anxiety and emotions, and I want to stay strong for them...especially my beautiful grandad. I honestly think that I will have a huge panic attack and break down, and I guess I’m just worried that I’m going to ruin Christmas and bring everyone down/make them sad and upset if I’m emotional and they were holding it all in. I know that sounds ridiculous...I’m always the overly emotional one and come off to everyone else as crazy, and that judgement and lack of understanding is so hard.
Does anyone have any words of wisdom or ways to work through this?
