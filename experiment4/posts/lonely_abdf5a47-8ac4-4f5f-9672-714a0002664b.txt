24M married but in the feels.
Im not in the doghouse im a good husband. I work from home, cook and clean and i take care of myself. But my wife doesnt do much of anything. Been like that almost a year now. Me and my daughter go to the park often and she never wants to come. She never wants to get frisky and i feel like its been too long for me. I try to encourage her to have fun and go out but she doesnt want to much. Idk what im doing here idk if i want an escape some sort of validation or im taking revenge by talking to other people. I feel like maybe im not attractive and maybe im not enough motivation for her. I want to help her but it would also be nice if i had some attention sometimes. Idk saying it all out lod sounds cheesy.
