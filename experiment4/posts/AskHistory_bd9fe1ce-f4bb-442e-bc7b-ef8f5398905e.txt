In your personal opinion, who/what are the most important people, nations, or events that you think should be common knowledge but isn’t?
I’m 23, and I just learned the actual events that took place with Napoleon, Otto Von Bismarck, and Admiral Yi, and I have to say I’m a little ashamed I don’t already know about these people besides their names and nationalities. What are some other underrepresented parts of history that you think should be more commonly known about?

Edit: I appreciate all the suggestions very much and can’t wait to start learning about them. I am in the middle of finals so my research will have to wait a couple days, but I am excited to dive into these topics. Thank you all for your replies.
