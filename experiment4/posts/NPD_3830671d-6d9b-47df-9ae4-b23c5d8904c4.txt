I’m a narcissist and hate myself for it
My family and friends have told me over the years and I realize they are right. I never care about anyone’s feelings except my own and only think about myself. I am also a very empty person which makes it hard to connect with other people. I have no feelings to the point where if my friends told me bad news I have to try and seem like I care when deep inside I don’t. I spend a lot of time looking in the mirror and focused on my looks to the point where I hate going outside if I am not done up. The guys I used to date always said how I never asked how they were doing/ complimented them but I expected them to act perfectly towards me.I used to have a list of plastic surgery I wanted ect. Anyways, I’m depressed bc it I don’t want to be this way. I want people to like me and to build genuine friendships. I want to spread love and warmth to people but I’m a cold person. I hate myself for it. I wish I was outgoing, happy and loving but instead I’m just empty, depressed and emotionless.
