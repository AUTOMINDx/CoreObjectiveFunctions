questioning therapy?
i just had these questions go through my mind:

**isn't it completely without any sense to have a one-sided relationship wherein one of the people tries to be their most intimate, most vulnerable self? doesn't this just further projection/transference and also avoidant attachment?**

don't get me wrong, i love therapy, but i also feel like it's important for me to think about these questions. please be kind to me in your answers. i'm having quite a day - found out that I'll have to quarantine until Christmas, among other things.

sending some warm hugs, in case anyone needs them.
