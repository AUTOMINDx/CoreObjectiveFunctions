24 F and my life is in shambles
I can’t stop crying. Last week I graduated nursing school and my mother couldn’t be happy for me. I barely passed my exams, she tried to start fights with me the whole time. She is verbally &amp;amp; mentally abusive. I believe she’s a narcissist, I try to tell friends, family and even my therapist but no one wants to accept a mother could do these things so I’m always told what I could do better….I do those things and nothing changes. She kicked me out Saturday. If I knew why I’d tell ya. I planned to move out January but now I’m stressing. 

My cars heater went out a month before graduation. I live in the Midwest. It’s getting super cold. I took it to 3 different mechanics and no one wants to fix it plus it’ll cost thousands of dollars. 

Sunday, the day after she kicked me out I had another stressful thing happen and I had a full blown panic attack. I couldn’t breathe and have never experienced that before. I went to the ER. It’s now Tuesday and I have to face my life. 

I’m laying on my boyfriends bed searching for roommates and car dealerships. I’m convinced he’s gonna leave me because my life is too stressful. In addition his friend died last week so he’s got his own stuff going on. My friends say they are here for me but have become distant. 

I have $1k to my name. A cold car. No where for me and my cat to go. I’m working. I start my new nursing job Jan 10th. 

Idk what to do. Happy holidays 🤍
