DAE feel constantly terrified that you’ve done something wrong?
I’m always terrified that i’ve done something wrong or bad or horrible but that I just can’t remember it.. I know for sure that there’s a piece of early life (like under 8 yrs) trauma that my brain can’t pick up on completely, instead I get flashbacks of a certain feeling and I freeze bc I’m scared that instead of it being me who suffered the trauma, it was me who might have done something traumatic. Which would explain why I’ve always felt like I’m bad, esp as a kid.

This is affecting me a lot and i’m having nightmares and everytime i’m online and i see someone describing a toxic person/narcissist/gaslighter/bad friend/manipulator I automatically assume that that is how I act and that is who I am, that i’m just bad.

Idek, just wanted to know if i’m alone with this.

Edit: Wow, I didn’t know this would get so much attention!! Thank you for the awards and mostly thank you so much everyone who replied, i’m a bit overwhelmed I cant reply to them all but it comforts me knowing that there’s ppl out there who also feel like this &lt;3
