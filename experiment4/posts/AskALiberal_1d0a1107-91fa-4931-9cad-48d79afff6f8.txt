Strategically speaking, why restart student loan payments?
From [Yahoo Money](https://money.yahoo.com/student-loan-repayment-resumes-february-153043104.html)

&gt;almost two-thirds of borrowers who owe roughly $1.7 trillion are worried about how they’ll afford their payments, according to a recent study from CreditKarma, while the Student Debt Crisis Center estimates that almost 9 in 10 borrowers aren’t financially prepared for the payments to return.

There is also fear that the system will not be able to handle a mass simultaneous restart of payments like this.

I get that Biden does not want to forgive loans based on things he’s said in the past so it’s not necessarily surprising. However it seems this would only hurt in the midterms and beyond. It also undercuts the “Covid isn’t over yet” message imo.
