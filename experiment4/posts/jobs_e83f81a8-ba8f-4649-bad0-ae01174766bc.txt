Is job hopping really as bad as people make it out to be?
Rewind to 2019 I was working in logistics making $35k, terrible benefits, no 401k matching. Since then I’ve worked at cyber security company, left for fintech, then returned to the cyber sec company I was at before. Each time the benefits got better and my salary consistently went up. 

I’m in the position where I might make the jump again. I have a new offer with tech company. I pay literally zero for great health insurance, remote work, base salary is $70k, and I get $15k company stock each year. 

If I stayed at my logistics company, I still wouldn’t be anywhere near what I make now. 

So for me, job hopping has been vital to get more pay and better benefits. 

Thoughts?
