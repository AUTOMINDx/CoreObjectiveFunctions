14 years of marriage just blew up in my face
A few days ago my wife (38F) told me (42M) that she’s not “in love” with me anymore. Two days before Christmas we’re on the couch with my two young kids telling them what’s up.

I think I’ve slept maybe six hours over previous three days.

I need to be a friend to my wife, for my own mental health, my ex and above all else, my kids sake. She wants us to be friends too.

...but the hurt... man, the hurt. She says she still loves me, but is not “in love” with me. How do I not let this hurt I’m feeling not poison this future friendship? 

I could get resentful, jealous, really fucking angry about it but it won’t serve any use. 

I guess what I’m asking for is: have any of you been through the same thing and found any ways that have helped? 

I’ll even chant mantras to myself if it helps! 

(For the record, my wife is a beautiful shiny soul, we’re just not that good together- it sounds stupid but it’s taken us this long to work that out.

EDIT: My love and thanks to so many of you. Thank you everyone single person that has contributed to this discussion as it has helped me see many different points of view from which to look at this. Thank Ypu.
