How to stop changing my mind about careers?
I’m close to graduating college and I have this bad habit of being really interested in a career for a few months and then losing complete interest a few months later. I know I want to work in the healthcare field, but I don’t know where I fit. 

I’m not sure if it’s my intuition or just me being scared to commit to a career path, but I need to figure out what im going to do after I graduate. Im looking into getting another degree or just going to trade school and picking something. 

My only requirements for a career is that it’s in healthcare, it pays roughly 65-70k (I live in TX so COL is pretty low but I want to be comfortable), and I can work 3-4 days so I have time to start a family in the future.
