I think I am finally grieving my childhood.
And I am glad that I am sad, crying because of it. I was never taught how to deal with my emotions, I used to lock myself in a closet to cry alone because of my violent older brother or because I felt I was different from other kids at school. I learned how to hide my pain from others because I was never given support. I have almost no memories from my childhood (due to aphantasia, that I think is trauma related) but most of them are just awful, like when my whole family used to make a beauty contest between me and my uncle's dog, and the dog was always the winner. 

I grew up so detached, tried to protect myself from all of this that I never let me just cry and grief. But not anymore, now I not only understand that a lot of my emotional problems come from CEN but I  feel it deep in my heart and I am close to forgive myself for everything.
I just wish I am able to learn how to connect with myself and try not to repress my feelings and thoughts anymore.
