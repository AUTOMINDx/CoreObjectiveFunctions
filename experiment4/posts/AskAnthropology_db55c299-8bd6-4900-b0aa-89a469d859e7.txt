How does this sub feel about attributing modern political philosophies to pre-modern/historic societies?
Just a student wondering how to reconcile attempts to compare past societies with current political philosophies.

It seems that in order to garner legitimacy, proponents of certain philosophies attempt to tie the maxims of their movements with seemingly natural human societal processes. For example, using trade and private/personal property in pre-modern/historic societies (Rome, Egypt, Songhai, Tuareg, Malawi are among some names I've personally heard mentioned) to validate capitalism, or inversely, communal ownership of the means of production in agricultural/pastoral/hunter-gatherer economies to validate socialism. It would probably become more relevant the closer one got to the present, but I'm not convinced.

Just hearing alot of attempts among my as equally unprofessional peers to justify beliefs by claiming X or Y society is \[*insert political philosophy*\], therefore, I'm right because look how well they did and we should do more of that etc.
