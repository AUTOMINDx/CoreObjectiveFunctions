If you could be 20 again, what would you learn to do?
Hi guys, not sure if this is adequate for the subreddit as its more of career advice but i thought people on here have their head screwed on properly and we might have a nice discussion.

Im 20 Yo, i moved to London on my own when i was 17 from Croatia after finishing secondary. I come from an abusive household and basically threw my whole past away and decieded to put in the work and get my life running.

I have since passed a lorry license and recently got the crane (hiab) license on top, i currently work for a builders merchant making £34 as they have done the crane license for me and will stick with them till i pass my Class 1 and move onto agency work as these Class 1 Hiab drivers are on some sweet money ( Looking at £20ph easily). I also do security work on the weekends on my ltd for some extra money and this makes me about extra 500-800 per month ( depending on how many shifts i snag up)

I know this is a very good setup and i surely cant complain at my age, however what moved me to seek opinions is taking on some course or learning to do something IT related.

With my childhood and upbringing i was always a bad student just could never focus and didnt amount to much, but i was always very tech-savy and i actually learn quite fast when i manage to focus.

With the stability in life to focus on something brought by the money im on im very interested in just sitting down and learning to code or something like that, but having no academic background i find myself a bit "undirected"

So for the sake of the conversation, if you are currently doing a really cushty job in it whether it backend programming or just editing videos. If you were at my age and situation, what direction would you personally go?

Cheers guys
