Would debt forgiveness for things like student debt and medical bills have negative effects on the economy?
I’m only asking because I saw a video on it, I liked it but I wasn’t sure how actually feasible debt forgiveness would be, or rather if there would be repercussions for immediate forgiveness given the structure of debt in America. Like, would creditors not having debt to sell around have any affects on the economy in the immediate? How about generally speaking long term? Has there been studies conducted on this? I haven’t been sure where to look so I just wanted to come here and ask.
