Do you ever get the feeling that you’re about to do something you shouldn’t but it almost feels inevitable?
Title sounds weird but idk how else to phrase it.

Someone in my life hasn’t been complying with what I feel are pretty reasonable needs. I need very clear boundaries, reassurance, to feel important and most importantly not to be fucking ignored. 

It’s probably in my head but I’m reading into a lot of what’s going on as her committing power plays against me, which really really pisses me off. And the resentment has been building. I’m thinking about either cutting it off, yelling at her or fucking some other girl. Just so I can walk away on top. 

I was pretty damn happy as of late, and when I’m with her in person everything is great. But I can’t fucking deal with it anymore. And I’m trying to restrain myself but it feels like I’m just pulling a rubberband slowly until it finally snaps. Maybe I wasn’t as ready for an intimate relationship as I thought 

Any advice would be appreciated. Wish my next therapy session was sooner lmao
