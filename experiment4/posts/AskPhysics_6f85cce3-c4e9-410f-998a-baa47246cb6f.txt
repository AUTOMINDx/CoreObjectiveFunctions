I don't want to be an engineer, I like physics.
Hi there, im currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (i mean get a degree and pursue higher studies in) as im also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But i don't want to leave physics, i love atomic physics and cosmology so much.
 I want to ask here, can i continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT) , will there be time for my passion.
Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?
