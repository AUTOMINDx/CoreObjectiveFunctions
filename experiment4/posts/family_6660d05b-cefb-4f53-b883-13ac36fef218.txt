I showed up to Christmas dinner purely to intimidate my homophobic family out of bullying my sister
Idk I just want to tell this story to someone. I (23F) wasn’t planning on going to Christmas with my family, I only live 30 minutes away but I’m not close with anyone but my sister (20F). I told her I wouldn’t be coming and she cried, she still lives at home and my family is not kind to her. I told her if she needed me to let me know and I’d come. Christmas Day she texted me a little before dinner. She Identifies as “queer” and she said she’d already been called the F - slur 3 times and people had only been there for a few minutes. I was livid. My family has hardly seen me in the past year, so I decided to be a bit dramatic. I dressed up in one of my favorite outfits with high heeled boots (I’m a D1 athlete and I think the fit shows off my muscles pretty well). My family has almost never seen me in makeup so I did my best winged eyeliner and gold eyeshadow. I walked in the door unannounced and refused to hug anyone but my sister and little brother. One of the first comments said at dinner was someone degrading my sister so I stared them straight in the eyes and called them out for it. I stayed the rest of the night practically daring anyone to so much as look at her the wrong way, but no one said anything after I responded to the first couple comments. 
I feel a little guilty for being so icy especially to my mom, but we aren’t close and she was a huge part of the problem. This probably wasn’t the most mature way to handle things but I’m proud. I lost a lot of confidence growing up with these people and have spent most of my life terrified of being disliked or ridiculed. I haven’t always stood up for my siblings like I wish I had, and honestly it’s empowering to not be intimidated out of it anymore.
The great news is she’s finally financially able to move out of there and will be rooming with me in a couple weeks.
