If two people are both high/intoxicated, and they have sex, is that consensual?
Hey everyone, I've had this question for a while. While I've never done this, some of my friends have gotten drunk or high and hooked up with someone else who was also drunk or high. They have never had sex, just either made out or done oral. Is this immoral? What does consent look like if both parties are intoxicated, especially if they are the same level of intoxication? What if they both agree to hook up when they are high/drunk before they get high/drunk?
