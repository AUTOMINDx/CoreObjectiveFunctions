My career has hit the rock bottom need you guidance to put it back on path.
I'm sorry for the long post

My degrees and professional experience is all over the place. I'm not able to figure out my passion, don't know my skills, natural strengths and what am I good at doing. There's no one to guide me and that's why my career is out of place. Already in my early 30's and still figuring out how the job market works. I have had enough with myself. Am struck and unable see what's down the line.  

Have too my jobs under my belt and it's looks so embarassing because most of the jobs are irrelevant from what I have studied.

Left my first job as I wanted to go to school for higher education, so I worked as a CS rep in between while I was waiting for the start date. 

Got a job right after school, unfortunately I lost it during COVID as the company went down permanently. Started working as an essential worker to put food food on table. I resigned after over an year because I had to move out to a different country. 

My education is no where linked up with the jobs I've done, and I don't know how to represent myself to employers "I am not a job hopper, I prioritize a stable career over money because I believe money comes in with time and growth"

Have a Bachelor's in finance, MBA marketing, PG diploma Supply chain, PG diploma International business, worked as a customer service rep, Quality Assurance, production supervisor, essential worker, and logistic. 

Took time off to ascertain myself. Please assist through the hardest times of my life. I highly appreciate for your guidance and time
