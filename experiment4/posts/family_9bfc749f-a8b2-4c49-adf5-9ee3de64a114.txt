My (16f) grandpa is the best!
I live in an unhealthy household (joint families suck but I don't wanna elaborate because this is a wholesome sub)

Ever since childhood, this left me feeling unloved at times and that is why I have wanted a dog since I was 5.

I have cried and even starved myself a whole day over this multiple times. 

My grandma and uncle just "don't like dogs" so I could not get one.

Recently, I finally wore my mother down and she agreed to buy me a puppy.

I had always wanted a golden retriever but chose a beagle because they're smaller and have less hair so it won't cause any inconvenience for my family.

However, other than my younger cousin, everybody in the house has been downright cruel to me.

Today, when I recieved videos of my puppy to be amd showed them to my aunt...she just ignored me.

Which is why when I approched my grandfather with my heart in my throat and showed him the video and he not only smiled but also said that the puppy is adorable and he cannot wait to meet him either, I nearly cried.

My grandfather helping me plead my case is the only reason why I'm getting a puppy in the first place.

I cannot express how much I love him. He's the best!
