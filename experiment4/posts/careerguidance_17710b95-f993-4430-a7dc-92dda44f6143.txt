Last day today working in high stress covid response. No acknowledge nor even goodbye. Don’t most employers give a send off?
This is a rant post. I’ve been deployed last two years in public health covid response, doing everything from policy writing to vaccine eligibility planning vaccine ops planning and modelling. I’m burnt out. Worked around the clock. 

Got offer at another organization not in health in a role for much higher pay and advancement,  which I accepted.

Today is my last day at work. I feel bad leaving everyone as they face omicron. We are short staffed, but it’s taken a toll.

Perhaps not surprising yet sad, is that I am not getting any send off or acknowledgment. All I got were responses that it’s a big loss for the team, and a lot of guilt tripping. Im not  getting a virtual goodbye. Others I noticed had gotten virtual meetings for staff to come together snd say goodbye.

Now I know I’m not even appreciated among my public health colleagues. What a shame.

Edit: to make it worse they asked me to be on call when needed during my approved vacation that I’m taking to end of the year. Today was my last working day!
