I don’t believe in love anymore
My friends were always full of admiration for how much faith I had in love and how I always opened up to people. But the last person really turned my heart to ice. I don't want it anymore. I just don't believe in it anymore.
It's always so much fun at first, but then I get "too close" again when I open myself up and I get pushed away. And then they don't want me anymore.
I feel like I'm the stepping stone to someone else's dream relationship. So first they date me, they dump me, and then they find the love of their life. And I'm left with the shards every time.

I want to learn to love myself. All the love I give to others, I want to give to myself. But I don't know how.

I would rather stay alone for the rest of my life than feel this pain 1 more time.

EDIT: I’m 27F :)
