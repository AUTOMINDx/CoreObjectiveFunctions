Another sufferer joins the ranks.
So, hello. 37M here from the States, have had GERD for quite some time now (~2015),  though, up until now,  it's been easily managed with a 20mg Omeprazole capsule each morning.  On the 17th,  however,  I had my first ever bout of heartburn from the reflux (thought it was a heart attack at first),  and it's pretty much been all heartburn all the time since then, even with Pepcid (though, granted,  I'm only done with day 4 of 10 with two a day, and eating bland food all week. About to make an appointment with the GI specialist on Monday,  but, gods, this is so rough.
