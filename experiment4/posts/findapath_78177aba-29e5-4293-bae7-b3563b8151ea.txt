I'm a depressed college dropout with no interests or aspirations
I've dropped out of college after trying it off and on for five and a half years. This past semester I failed almost all my classes because I'm so depressed I can barely do anything. All these years have now gone to waste. I feel like such a failure and a loser. I have no plans other than to waste away living with my parents and play video games: I have no motivation or interest in doing much else. Besides, I feel like the world is going to end anyway, so it doesn't matter what I do. I need serious help.
