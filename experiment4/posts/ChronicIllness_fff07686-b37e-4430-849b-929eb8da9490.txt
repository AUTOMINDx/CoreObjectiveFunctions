Feeling a bit lost at the moment
I'm currently having a very hard time eating and drinking, as it makes me very nauseated and sick for hours afterwards. I'm on nausea meds, but they've quit working. I was tested for gastroparesis 2 weeks ago, and it came back negative. Since the test, I've lost 10 pounds, have been able to eat less and less, am unable to drink even water, and am feeling very weak and tired. I used to sleep around 6 hours each day, but am now sleeping up to 13 hours a day, and I'm still left tired.

As of right now, my urine is brown, I can no longer speak well, and am struggling to walk. My GI doc keeps prescribing meds that I can't take, and doesn't seem to be concerned at all. I have no idea what to do, and I feel like my body is failing.

Where do I go from now? I have no idea what to do, and I can't afford an ER trip. Please, if anyone has any tips or thoughts, I'm open to them. I know I *should* be asking my doctor this, but I have asked him, and he said I was fine. I guess this is just me casting a line out for any help or advice.

UPDATE: Just got a thing of ensure down me (forced it down me, but hey, it works) and am sipping on water. If I throw it back up, I'll go ahead and go to the ER or UC. Thank you all so much for the help and suggestions. If something happens, I'll add another update &lt;3

UPDATE #2: Kept the ensure and water down and am currently drinking biolyte IV in a bottle. Feeling a bit more hydrated now, and while I'm still nauseated, it isn't as severe as when I made this post. Thanks for the help and support!
