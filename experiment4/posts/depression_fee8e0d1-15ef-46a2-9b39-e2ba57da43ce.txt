I hate this time of the year
I genuinely hate this time of the year. It is so fucking stupid. Everyone is fake nice and happy, pretending like everything is perfect and wonderful. It's dumb and I just want to be left alone.

Edit: I have never had a good Christmas and am in no contact with my family. Currently, I am living with my in-law because COVID fucked me over financially, and he had decided to host Christmas day (I lost my healthcare management job in long-term care because we lost almost all our residents causing the company have no money and had a bad miscarriage right after losing my job that resulted in surgery and not being able to work for a minute). I don't want to sit and have these fake pleasantries with people I don't know.
