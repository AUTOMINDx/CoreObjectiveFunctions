Ex college athlete soon to graduate with BS in Biomedical Engineering and 0 work experience. Worth staying in school to make up for misused time?
I have a pretty good GPA but I have gotten no work experience nor have I done any non-athletic extracurriculars during my undergraduate studies. I don't really like my major either as I never really specialized in anything. I feel like I wasted the last 4 years by not having my priorities straight and picking a weak major. Do you think that it would be more worth my time to stay in school and pursue a second bachelors in a more specialized degree while doing relevant internships or to try getting a job in industry with a blank resume?
