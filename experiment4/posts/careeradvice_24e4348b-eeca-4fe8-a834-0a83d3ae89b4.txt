Managerial title vs higher pay
Got an offer of $250k for a similar title, currently earn about $150k.

Manager told me he's asking for my promotion to manager level. I expect my salary to increase by no more than 20%, so it will likely be less than ~$200k. My manager does not know about my offer.


Put yourself in my shoes, what would you do?




**Edit:**

Some additional details, I would be building a team and have some direct reports.

I also enjoy working where I am now, I don't however, like that I'm compensated below the median market rate for my location.
