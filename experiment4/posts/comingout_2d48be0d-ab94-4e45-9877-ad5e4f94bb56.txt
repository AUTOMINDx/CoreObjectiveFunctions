My coming out was not planned and its really taking a toll on me
I came out to my mom right cause she was gonna look through my insta on my phone and see my gender to so I rather her just know this. and it went eh she thinks im too young and thinks its a phase she told me its against the bible and asked me if I was influenced and told me its not a cool thing and Idk she says she loves me and im still her child and thats great but thats the bare minimum. I feel really bad not about coming out but the way she reacted the response hurts she promised not to tell anyone and to forget about this but It hurts still I wish I was back in the closet I wish that I had more time until telling her its a mess of emotions im feeling and its been hours after I just wanna forget about this experience. I need advice on how to just forget about it cause its interfering with my life rn.

Edit: Guys btw im a lesbian not trans im not cis either im genderfaer (its like genderfluid but I never feel fully male but I can feel partly male)
