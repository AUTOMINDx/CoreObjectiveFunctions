My boyfriends view on women’s body types effects me, what to do?
Context:  I was looking through online shopping websites and made a comment about how it saddens me that businesses often use the typical model and don’t utilize all body types more. These were the comments that my boyfriend made in the conversation that followed:

My boyfriend does often tell me I am beautiful and sexy however, during our conversation has told me that he would never say that he thinks I am the most beautiful or sexy woman in his eyes because he would be lying. He also believes that magazines shouldn’t include women of all body types but rather it is okay that only those with the standard society ‘model’ body type of skinny and fit are represented in magazines because they are the most sexy and additionally ‘sex sells’.

Objectively speaking I am average in fitness and attractiveness (that is I am relatively skinny, but not the most toned and skinny person you’ve seen, I can accept this) and I do not have the ‘model’ body type. 

I do not believe a partner should make the comments he has to me and I do not agree with my partners position on magazine models. This has affected me deeply as I struggle a lot with low self-esteem and feel like I will never be physically amazing in his eyes. I have approached him about this but his response is that I should accept we have different opinions, I should just be happy with who I am, and that if I want to be sexier I should work on it for myself. What should I do next?
