When I was a teen, my father (a medical doctor) used to give me his opiates (Vicodin,OxyContin) when I would get toothaches instead of taking me to the dentist.
Then, exactly once, he took me to get an emergency root canal. They prescribed Tylenol with codeine and he allowed me only one pill while he kept the rest. 

I’m 38 and I just realized that’s not f$&amp;king normal at all. I hate uncovering things like this. I hate having the ability to now really  process what he did. 

Every little thing he did was abusive or neglectful. I can’t cope realizing that, for every moment I spent with my father, he spent hating me.
