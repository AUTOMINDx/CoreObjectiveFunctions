24 years old, bought house in March in hometown, feeling stuck
Feeling stuck and very anxious lately. Saved up enough money to buy a house in March. Been at job for going on two years now. Feeling like I need a drastic change (i.e. moving to a different state). Girlfriend dumped me in July because she's graduating college in the spring and wants to move to Nevada. I didn't want to move because I just bought a house. Now I'm thinking I want to move. Only thing keeping me where I'm at is my family. My parents are getting old, my sister just had a kid, I feel like should stick around but I also think I want to move
