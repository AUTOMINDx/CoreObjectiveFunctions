Any creative-minded people here (artists, musicians) with emotional childhood neglect?
Hey,

Any creative-minded people here (artists, musicians) with emotional childhood neglect? I have since I was a little child always been drawn more to art than people. Started with painting and then transitioned into creative writing and producing music. Music truly opens up my emotions and I feel that music has and will always be the driving force to stay alive from my past childhood neglect.

Besides music, animals are the only thing that opens up my numb feelings from emotional childhood neglect.

Anyone else can relate?
