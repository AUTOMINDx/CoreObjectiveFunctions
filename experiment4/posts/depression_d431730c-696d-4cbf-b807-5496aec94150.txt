I only visited depression, hats off to those that live there.
I’d like to apologize to everyone struggling with their depression and/or anxiety. I’ve definitely been that person that thinks, “What happened to them that they can’t get their shit together?”

My brother died when I was 19 and while there was depression related to that, it was ‘understandable’ and ‘acceptable’. I have never before experienced the heavy blanket that just crushes my “liveliness” and makes me want to sleep my life away. 

I am much better now. I aggressively reached out for people in my church and threw myself into volunteering efforts. But I know this is not a recipe for all. 

I experienced the perfect storm of post-Covid depression, a recent move and huge distance from my support network. Fortunately I recovered quickly. 

To those that chronically suffer- it is a terrible burden. I am so sorry for your pain. It’s not in your head and you deserve just as much compassion as those with visible ailments.

God bless.
