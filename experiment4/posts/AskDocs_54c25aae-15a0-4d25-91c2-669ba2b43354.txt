Please help me understand my partner's passing (cancer).
My 33M partner passed away in June from stage IV, BRAF mutation bowel cancer. His first symptom appeared in mid-March, diagnosis at the end of April. He passed in mid-June. Pre symptom appearing, he was fit, apparently healthy, ate a balanced diet and was very health conscious.

He passed away peacefully at home. I still find it difficult to accept that he is gone and I would like to understand the process of his mind and body shutting down. Part of it is that I was his primary carer... and I hope, hope with every last part of me that I made him as comfortable as he could be. But death isn't kind, right? He must have suffered in those last few hours.

My questions are:
Was he still lucid, or conscious, in his last hours?
How much pain would he have felt (even with morphine administered hourly?)
Was he 'gone' when he took his last breath - or after that?

I guess what I would appreciate is a description of what happens with his brain, organs and systems as he left the world. 

Thank you.
