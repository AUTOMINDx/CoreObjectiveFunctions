How do you learn IC's so well?
I'm learning electronics and it's really confusing to me when I'm thinking up some random project and as I'm picking out the parts I think I can use to bend the world to my will, my teacher walks pasts, takes one look at what I'm doing, and goes "Oh, you can just use 74SL47 for that"

How do you learn all these IC's? Is it just experience? Is there some sort of catalogue for them? Some rhyme or sense behind the number designation? I don't understand and I'm scared and need an adult.
