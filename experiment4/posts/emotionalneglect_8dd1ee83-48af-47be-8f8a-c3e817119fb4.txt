Is anyone else realising that their friends treated them badly growing up?
I'm starting to realise that I had a lot of very poor treatment from friends growing up. 

They would often tease me about how I acted and constantly bring up embarrassing things I did. 

There were times when they were considerate, helpful and kind to me too. 

However looking back it makes me angry when there were many times they treated me badly. 

There were also many times where I was made to feel that I did not matter. My opinions didn't matter, my needs didn't matter and my accomplishments or the interesting things I had done in my life didn't matter. 

I've moved away from my childhood town and don't see many of the friends I grew up with. For me this is somewhat of a blessing as some distance has allowed me to view the friendships more objectively. 

I believe I have codependent traits and now realise how much of my time was spent considering the needs of others above my own. 

In spite of their bad treatment they still gave me more attention and showed more interest in me than my father seemed to. 

What makes me angry is the idea that maybe my life would have been happier and better if I'd been around people who treated me better. 

Just a vent really...
