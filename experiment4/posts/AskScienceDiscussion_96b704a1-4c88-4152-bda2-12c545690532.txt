Plastic eating organisms - looking for wild speculations.
Is it possible for life to evolve the ability to break down plastics?

If it is possible, there should be rather strong environmental pressure in that direction. An organism that develops the capability will tap into a huge new food source.

Can that happen quickly enough to threaten the technical civilization relying on plastic?

The analogy I am tinking about are fungi developing the ability to digest lignin at some point.
