anyone else seeks therapy but your issue is mainly - tired of living even though nothing remotely bad is going on in your life other than having to live life till you somehow die?
i stopped going for therapy a few months back because that’s my main issue and i don’t think therapy can help? 

i did tell my last therapist (new and was our first session) that i just did not want to live and saw no point in life but there was nothing major going on in my life other than finding a job (but i’m employed now and my thoughts are still the same) but they just kept asking me “why”… i don’t know why.. my brain is just wired this way?

thoughts or advice? maybe i’m just a lost cause?
