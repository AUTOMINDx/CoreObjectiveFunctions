Where to start with analytic?
I've been studying for almost eight years in uni but everything continental, from phenomenology to post-structuralism. I know next to nothing about analytic. I know who Frege and Whitehead and Russell and Wittgenstein are but I don't think I really know what they said and wrote and why. I would like to get to read more now we're in summer break here down south. I'm mainly interested in metaphysics/ontology, epistemology and logic (not so much in language).

What would you recommend to start with? I would like to get to read the philosophers themselves, but good secondary sources are welcome as well. I think the name of Bertrand Russell is the one that calls my attention the most, but I see he wrote just an awful lot about almost everything.

I will gladly welcome any recommendation!
