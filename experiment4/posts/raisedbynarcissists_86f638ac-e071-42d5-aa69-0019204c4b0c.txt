If you're still young and live with your n-parent, record everything they do.
What they did. Where they did it. When they did it. And who was there.

Trust me, in your mid-20s they will suddenly have amnesia and pretend like you had an amazing childhood.

ETA: The point of writing it down will be for YOU. Obviously n-parent will continue to gaslight, but at least you won't have to question your own sanity. You'll have proof for yourself and proof for anyone outside of the family if needed.

ETA2: I guess I should add that by "record" I mean that you should write down what happens. I wouldn't recommend actually video/voice recording without their consent especially in their own home. In some states I know it is illegal to use recording when the other person doesn't know especially when privacy is expected
