am I at wrong, or is my mom?
So, for Christmas, I made everyone cute things out of clay, like animals, and I made a cute little fairy for my mom. (Mind you, it takes a while for me to make humans out of clay, so it was hard.) So this morning, I was about to put them in the oven so they could harden, but my mom comes and says she wants the bunny I made for my grandma. I say ok, and I just guessed I'd give the fairy to my grandma, and my mom the bunny. Later this night, she looks at me and says she wants both. I, of course say I can't do that, because I was exhausted, and wouldn't be able to make another clay thing for my grandma. She keeps asking me for both, and then I eventually got very mad at her, and started insisting, she could only have one, because it's not fair. She ends up leaving my room, saying she doesn't want any, and I'm not sure if I'm at wrong, or if she is. I mainly need advice to know when to put my foot down on things, and stand my ground, and when not too. Any advice will help.
