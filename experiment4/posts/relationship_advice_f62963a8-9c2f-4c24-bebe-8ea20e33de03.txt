Thanks to everyone that gave me good advice. Lately I’ve been having some really tough days because for some reason I had my past husband in mind all the time, and I‘ve been going from really sad to breaking down and crying and all type of thoughts, which is something that hasn’t happened in years. 

Well, I (33F) followed some of the advices and had a talk with my fiance (31M) about it. He suggested that we should postpone the wedding and that I need to go back to therapy, and that’s what we’ll be doing. We’ve been together for 2 years now, and maybe waiting a little bit longer will be a good thing anyways. He thinks that besides the fact that the whole situation was hard enough for me, I might be traumatized because I was in the same car accident and nothing happened to me. Not even a scratch. But I was there and I saw everything happening, and I saw him dead. For a long time I wished it was me who died that day, and I really thought I had moved past those thoughts. I still feel like part of me certainly died that day. My fiance said we don’t need to rush things, he just wants me to be okay, and he we’ll wait until I’m ready for it. I’m really thankful that he’s very understanding. That’s a huge part of the reason why I love him, for those who thought I was just using him: he understands me, he’s patient, he’s gentle, and he takes care of me. 

Thinking about this all day gave me an awful headache, but I’m just leaving this update here to thank everyone and to say that hopefully things will get better someday. I’m not usually that depressed or nostalgic, it’s just been a really hard moment.
