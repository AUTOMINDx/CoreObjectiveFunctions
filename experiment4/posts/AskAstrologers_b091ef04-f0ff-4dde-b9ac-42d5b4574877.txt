QUICK REMINDER: Stop posting tables of chart placements please and thank you
It literally breaks rule #5 if you’d actually take a look at the rules for once. Not just that but it’s not even nearly as accurate as an actual chart. A Leo stellium in the 1st house can be so much different to a Leo stellium in the 8th. Then you have all the “experts” replying to these posts of table lists with horrible insight just because they had bad experience with the said stellium sign. And last but not least what the hell is this subs obsession with stelliums? I’ve seen one person post a table list of a chart that had a 5 planet ( i think) stellium that isn’t even theirs just for a few upvotes.

Edit: Thanks for the awards :)
