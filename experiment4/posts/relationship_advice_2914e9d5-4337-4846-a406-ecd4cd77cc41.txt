My (27F) bf (35M) is pushing me to get a boob job.
Yeah as you can see in the title, my (27F) bf (35M) of one year suggested that I should get a boob job! Just to give some context, I am 5' 8" and I am quite skinny with a bigger ass. I have a nice body (obviously not bragging) which i always gets complimented on and my bf has always found me attractive. The other night he told me that since my body is so hot... I should get a boob job to be perfect! I am really mad...I'm not sure if it is ok tbh. But also don't know how to react to this. Please help.

TLDR; My bf is pushing me to get a boob job.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments! I can't respond to every single one so I thought I'll just update the original post. Honestly after reading all the comments and thinking a bit I decided to dump his ass! I don't mind plastic surgery... I have done some but he's in no position to suggest that because it's my body... anyways! He gotta go! 

Thanks y'all!
