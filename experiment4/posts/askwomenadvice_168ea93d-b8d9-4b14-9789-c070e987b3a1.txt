I'm addicted to a man and I need serious words of wisdom (please don't be too mean)
First off : I know I am an idiot, so please refrain from reminding me - or do, maybe I need to be told how stupid I am again.

Background: I (30) dated a man (29) on and off for 3 years. He has broken up with me a total of 4 times, the most recent being 3 days ago on a relaxing Monday evening, over the phone. 

He and I reconnected after 2 months apart in July. This was the time he begged and pleaded to get back together. He made a tonne of promises and made his friend speak to me. He has some serious psychological issues, which are abundantly clear. He refuses to go to therapy. 

In fact, the one condition we got back together on this time was that we would go for couples therapy. After 5 months, I told him - him not going to couples therapy is him basically saying he does not want to be in this relationship since that was the only literal condition in which we would get back on. 

He travelled for work recently, he is doing really super well at work... and anyway, he spoke with his friends and (according to him) spent a lot of time thinking and decided he made a mistake coming back and does not, in fact, want to get married after all. Not just that, he does not want to be in a relationship at all. 

This is the literal fourth time he has said this but I don't know why I am so addicted to him. And he ALWAYS does this when things start going really well. Like when we are happy and comfortable and making changes and talking about our future. I KNOW he is not interested and just using me to pass time. But WHY am I so addicted to him? I still want to be with him. I still love him. I never wanted the relationship to end in the first place and I am always the one suffering. Jesus, I feel so damn stupid.
