Is there a phrase for people's tendency to ignore what you say and to instead respond to their own little conversation? Why do people do this?
Not necessarily a Strawman argument, but where you're essentially having two different (but similar) conversations. It's like people just assume you have some hidden meaning or agenda, or something.

Like, random example, but if I say "I like pineapples" and someone responds with "You don't like bacon? Why? What's wrong with you??" or "Banana cream pie is disgusting tho" or something. Even though neither bacon, bananas, or pies were at all mentioned.

It's exhausting to have so many conversations that go nowhere, just spinning out, because people hear what they want to hear rather than the words coming out of your mouth. I'd like to better understand this tendency (I know I've *probably* done it at some point, myself, even if I can't remember)
