genuine validation from therapist??
does anyone else overthink the compliments their therapist gives them? I often think my T is lying when she says something nice to me. She's told me she looks forward to our sessions no matter the day/time, she's also told me she isn't required to care so much but that she does, among other really nice things. I think she says these things because I often talk about how detached I've been from my parents my whole life and how much I crave their attention/love. Maybe i'm overthinking it but there's always a voice in my head telling me my T is just saying these things because I want to hear them. I wish I could believe her because I trust and value her opinion so much but it's just hard to think she'd mean it. Am I the only one who overthinks validation from their T because it's driving me crazy
