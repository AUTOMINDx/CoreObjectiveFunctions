my sibling committed suicide i dont know what to feel or think
he took our parents car and drove to a large bridge, the police came to our house and let us know their car was found abandoned on the bridge and a body was found in the water. i cried so much and now it just feels like someone ripped my heart out it hurts all i can think of is what could have been going through his head and what he thought of us. i jusf want to be acknowledged something anything really nothing feels like anything
