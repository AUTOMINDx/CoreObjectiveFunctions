Denied WFH, how mad should I be?
I work at small company and 90% of the people work at home. Of those 10%, it is new hires who can’t work from home yet. There is a policy that you have to be there a certain amount of time before you can WFH. 4 weeks ago I was coming up on that time and asked HR about WFH and what I need equipment wise. Well, that same day my boss calls me into his office and has a talk with me, where he says he is not letting me work from home (even though he previously said I could) because he wants to have daily meetings with me. This boss has super high expectations and other people that work for him are working 12-16 hour days for weeks just to finish the amount of work he gives. I, however, refuse to do that (8-5 are my hours) and he is not happy with me. He stated in a performance review that the reason he won’t let me WFH is because I don’t reach out for help enough which is a complete lie. My boss says he will re-evaluate my WFH request in February however I am skeptical that he will even allow it then.
