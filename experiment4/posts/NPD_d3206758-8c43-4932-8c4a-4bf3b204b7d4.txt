Want to learn about NPD? Screw Psychology, read Slavic Literature instead
I've been thinking about boundaries and the whole idea seemed bizarre to me, I was puzzled as apparently everyone else understands them. I came to that conclusion when reading articles on boundaries - in my perception, nobody feels the necessity to thoroughly explain or define the concept, as if it was obvious and a word that even kids use.

Boundaries suddenly made sense when I noted that English is not my native language, I was raised in Poland, and the Polish speak of the concept using different wording.

Culturally, we do not speak of boundaries, **we speak of self-respect** or the lack of thereof.  The difference can be illustrated as below:

* *You should not tolerate his belittling or shaming remarks. You need to have some boundaries.*
* *You’re way too permissive of his belittling or shaming remarks. You need to respect yourself more.*

Technically it's just language/cultural differences... But I have to be Narcissistic here, the choice of words that we culturally use is better. Drawing a boundary is just setting some rules, having self-respect is much more than that. "Self-respect" is a word that by itself contains many lessons and implications -- and points to the nature of the problem. If you love abusers, you don't respect yourself and clearly something's wrong with you.

What is more, my culture is far more knowledgeable when it comes to Pathological Narcissism - not everyone studies psychology or knows what’s a personality disorder, but the majority grasps the principle of it very well.

Throughout 12 years of education, as a part of the literature course, Polish kids are obliged to read and interpret works that include:

* The myth of Oedipus
* The myth of Narcissus. I had to write essays on Narcissism about 3 times
* Dostoyevsky

And that’s just on top of our national literature which contains many hidden gems filled with lessons on NPD, written by authors who lived long before Freud was born. We have a 500 page story about a man who during the year of 1878, had spent an equivalent of today’s 1.758.338,40$, a quarter of his entire fortune, to impress a vain girl from the higher classes of nobility. The title is “The Doll” by Bolesław Prus. Spoiler: she didn’t really give a fuck about the poor guy.

Dostoyevsky is #1 on Pathological Narcissism, but Polish literature is not inferior to Russian))) Unfortunately, I have to admit that Russians have got more to be proud of in terms of numbers. It makes sense that Russia is many times bigger and thus ended up having many times more literary pieces.

Another book I remember from my school years is indeed a Russian book, “A Hero of Our Times” by Mikhail Lermontov. It was on the list of non-obligatory reading when I was in high school. I loved the book and I remember “understanding” the main character, and any fictional character that I can resonate with – usually turns out to be a fully fledged Pathological Narcissist.

I don’t have the time for analyzing literature today, so I just googled for “Lermontov + Narcissism” -- and the below was copied from [somebody’s](http://tredynasdays.co.uk/2013/08/mikhail-lermontov-a-hero-of-our-time/) blog:

&gt;A Hero of our Time is then that very modern type of novel: **the self-analysis of the protagonist’s motives**.  As William E. Harkins says in his Afterword to this edition, Pechorin **is ‘narcissistic and neurotic’, unable to love, addicted to ‘empty posing’,  pettily manipulative, ‘opportunistic’ and ‘at times even vindictive’** in his treatment of women and men – the sad figure of Maxim is unforgettable when Pechorin spurns his friendship.  **He might today be described as sadistic – like so many other flawed, anguished and alienated** Romantic heroes, from Schiller’s The Robbers (1781) to Eugene Onegin and the proud, jaded heroes of Byron, and shortly afterwards, the Bronte sisters’ Heathcliff (who also liked to make ‘the worms suffer’) and Rochester, and Dostoevsky’s Stavrogin.  Harkins points out that Pechorin is **full of contradictions: heroic and neurotic, sensitive to injustice and callously indifferent to the suffering of others, a worshipper of women’s beauty and a narcissistic self-adorer**.  He is the forerunner of countless existential outsider heroes in later fiction, **the nauseated figures disgusted by other people and by their own ennui, filled with indifference and hostile to the matching indifference of an irrational world**.  This novel prepared the way for the more profound explorations of psychological depths of character portrayed in the masterpieces of Turgenev, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy.

I am led to believe that the author and the cited sources haven’t studied psychology and it’s possible that they don’t even know what a Personality Disorder is. Indeed, William E. Harkins was a Professor Emeritus of the Department of Slavic Languages. By a mere coincidence, they had accurately described NPD.

I don't wanna be belittling of other cultures, but this is the NPD subreddit where Narcissists post, so fuck it. Excuse my arrogance for a brief moment:

Dear Western Comrades, **Gatsby was a small fish**. Real fictional Narcissists rode horses in the wild steppes, kidnapped brides and were experts in fucking around. So grab some vodka, drink your sorrows away – and immerse yourself in the Slavic Literature.
