Are minors allowed to talk about inappropriate subjects with therapists?
Hey. I'm a 16 year old kid. Male. 

Trust me when i say that i do not want to get into an awkward conversation with my therapist. Especially since he's pretty old and we're both guys. I have hesitated to touch upon inappropriate topics just to not make things weird, but i might have to briefly touch upon something a little NSFW in order to talk about another important issue which isn't NSFW. And i'm wondering if it's legal since it technically could count as a sexually-driven conversation with a minor. 

Would it be a bad idea to bring up the NSFW topic or should i find a way to avoid talking about it? If anything, the NSFW issue is barley relevant but still is required to understand another issue that sparked from it. Thanks.
