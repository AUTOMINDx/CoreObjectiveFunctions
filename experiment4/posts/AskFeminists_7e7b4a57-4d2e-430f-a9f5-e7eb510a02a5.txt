Book: 'Womanhating' by Dworkin
If you read it what did you think about the last part in Dworkins 'Womanhating' about Androgyny.
She wrote it very well, it made a lot of sense.. 

Then my eyes just fell out of my eye sockets. 

The animal and !nc3st part (idk if I will be banned for even mentioning that word)
It made me so uncomfortable
And it is hard to think that she wanted to really say: hey everyone, let's abolish gender so we can have s3x with animals and our family members🧚‍♀️
But that's basically what I've read and what she noted. 

I see what she means. I understand what she means. But.. Wth?

Can someone please give me more nuance, information or background?
