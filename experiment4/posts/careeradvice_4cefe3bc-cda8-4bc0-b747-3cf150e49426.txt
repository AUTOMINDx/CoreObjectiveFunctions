my company does not value me - I'm depressed. what should I do?
I'm so unmotivated from my current work

There are multiple reasons.

first, I figured I get paid less than my coworkers who holds similar work experiences and in a same role. they even came in later than me but I think my company started to pay more to people who came in after me.

second, I told my manager and HR about it but they took no actions. I did have conversation with them and they said they will work on it but it's been more than 2 weeks I got no updates when i was promised that there will be something within few days.

third, I was sick and was unmotivated from work so I was slow last week and past few days. My manager said i need to get my stuffs done before I was on sick leave.

My work is very heavy load work, busy work.

I'm okay with the busy work but not willing to do all these work when I know that I get paid lower than peers and company does not value me.

I was a top performer but I don't know if it's even worth keeping up with my performance when they don't value me.

I think it's not worth it to try working hard here anymore and better look for somewhere else. What do you guys think?

I worry that I have so much work I can't look for new job unless I become slow at my current work..

what should I do ?
