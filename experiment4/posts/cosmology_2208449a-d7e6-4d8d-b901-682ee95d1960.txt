Why was the young universe hot?
Please forgive me if this question reveals how little I understand about cosmology. It’s my understanding that the Big Bang was a rapid spreading of space rather than a spreading out of matter into empty space. So if space itself was spreading out, and if we trace time back to shortly before t = 0, why would the density of the universe be greater and therefore the universe be hotter? I understand that the CMBR is evidence that the early universe was hot, but I don’t understand why it was hot.
