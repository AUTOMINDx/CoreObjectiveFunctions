Interviewing while pregnant. No parental leave before 12 months? When should I tell my new employer?
Hi everyone, I just completed the last round of interviews with one of my dream companies. It went really well and I am truly hoping for an offer letter sometime this week. In case this doesn’t work out I have 3 interviews lined up this week. 
That said, I found out in the middle of the interview process that I am pregnant. I quit my previous job for health reasons a little over a month ago. So I have to find a new role asap. That said, I am worried that I won’t qualify for parental leave at any of the companies I go next since majority requires you to be employed for 12 months at least. I have 7 months before the due date. I am not sure how to go about it. Is this something I can negotiate for before signing the offer letter? Thanks.

I am currently in Colorado, USA.
