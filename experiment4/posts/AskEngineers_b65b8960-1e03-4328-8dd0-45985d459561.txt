Dealing with negative colleagues
One of my fellow engineers is a black hat thinker. I respect that and generally prefer to have a pessimist in the team, especially because sometimes you need to hear why something is a bad idea. The problem is, if somebody presents an idea this colleague will shoot it down with 10 reasons why it's never going to work. And sometimes it's really basic issues that perhaps sound complicated at first. So sometimes when wanting to get things done, it means constantly having to power through a wall of negativity coming from them. Its difficult to see this as anything other than simply looking for excuses to not do work. How do you guys deal with this, and how would you manage a person like this?
