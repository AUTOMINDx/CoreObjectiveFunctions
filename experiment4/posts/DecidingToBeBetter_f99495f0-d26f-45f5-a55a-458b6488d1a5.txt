i’m very addicted to my phone (and u probably are too)
the average attention span has gone down from 10 seconds to 4…. we can’t listen anymore. we’re spending sm time on our phones that it’s raising our base level of dopamine to the point where if we aren’t facing constant stimuli then we don’t know what to do w ourselves and try to make up for it w racing thoughts. 

i’m so glued to my phone, i’ll accidentally waste the whole day bc i can’t get off of it. but when i am off it i just feel sad and alone. idk i really hate this, i feel like i’m wasting away. 

how can i break away from this?
