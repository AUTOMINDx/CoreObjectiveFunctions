LPR- overall just feeling very depressed
I have started the acid watcher diet, and itâ€™s my 7th day. Im having an incredibly hard time adjusting. I feel like I canâ€™t participate in normal life anymore, things that I took for granted everyday. Tonight I had a panic attack in a Thai restaurant because Iâ€™m visiting family, and it just sucks so much to only be able to order steamed vegetables and steamed brown rice, it doesnâ€™t even taste good. 
I work in a cafe, as a barista, and now I canâ€™t even 98% of the menu, nor drink coffee. I love coffee. And as any fellow service worker probably understands, working customer service without it is rough. 
Iâ€™m feeling incredibly sad about the holidays. I donâ€™t want to even celebrate with my family because I wonâ€™t be able to eat any of the good food all day. 
My work party is coming up, and I will be the only one who canâ€™t drink. 
Iâ€™ve recently started seeing someone, and I feel incredibly lame. I canâ€™t go eat out with them, we canâ€™t grab drinks. 
Iâ€™m incredibly sad that I donâ€™t get to enjoy the things that make me happy. 
Not to mention, my favorite thing to do and my dream ever since I was a child was to be a singer/songwriter. Iâ€™m really ducking sad!!!! And I can already tell the people in my life already are over hearing about it 
All of this on top of my never ending symptoms and hanger is too much
