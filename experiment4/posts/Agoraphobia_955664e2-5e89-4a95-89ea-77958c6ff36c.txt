I'm a chronically depressed highschool dropout who's been an agoraphobic hermit for the past 15 years. Has anyone ever managed to make a comeback from something like this?
Besides going to school when I was a kid/teen, I've never went anywhere by myself. Except for my mother, who happens to be as miserably depressed as myself, I'm utterly alone. No one can help me, and I'm too broken to help myself. Me and my mom are barely even alive at this point, and we're essentially just watching each other slowly wither away. I'm glad that I have her to talk to, and that we can both understand each other so well, but at the same time we only intensify each other's depression and things are only getting worse and worse. I really wished I'd drowned to death when I was a child. It would've saved me a lot of needless hassle.
