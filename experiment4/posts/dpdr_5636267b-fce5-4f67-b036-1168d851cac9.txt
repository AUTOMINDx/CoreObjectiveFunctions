Lighting can make a HUGE difference
From the sterile sickening white fluorescent lighting used in grocery stores which seems to trip me out even on a good day, to the atmospheric mood lighting in certain venues that make me feel cozy even when I'm feeling pretty detached, it's taken me a long time to realise that lighting really effects how I feel. 

I realised that's one of the main reasons I hate grocery shopping and hated working in a department store (besides from the noxious odour of cheap plastic and the customer service bullshit) 

Replacing some globes in my house with one's that aren't so bright and white has had a pretty significant impact 

Does anyone feel the same way?
