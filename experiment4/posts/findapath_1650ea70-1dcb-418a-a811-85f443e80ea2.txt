HELP: What To Do When You're Burned Out &amp; Don't Want to Do Anything At All?
I guess maybe I need some motivation, or a reskill, or something. I have zero interest in working in my industry at all. It's pretty unanimously shitty to people in my role, and pretty much a dead end unless I wanna move into management.

I don't have any burning passions in life that I'd want to turn into some enterprise or anything. I just know I can't stand the job I'm in, and want out desperately. Like, I would quit tomorrow and take a job at a pizza place if I didn't have kids &amp; a mortgage and could take a 2/3 pay cut.

But then, I think to myself, man, I am really unhappy, stressed, and anxious from my job, and that's how my family sees me. So... I really need out. I can't be this awful husband and father to them, they don't deserve that.

I just don't know what else to do. I've done this for 7 years. I can't start over in some entry-level role somewhere and put in another 7 years hoping I'll find my "calling" (I'm 40 and haven't found it yet).   
The only thing I could think to do would be learn web dev/code (those jobs are huge around here and pay high). I'm just not *that* interested in it (ok, it's more interesting than what I currently do), but if I have to do it to make a living I'm confident I could do it well.

I just don't want to do ANYTHING, really. I don't find any kind of pride or internal reward from my work. I do it strictly for pay (and the opportunity to be acknowledged, promoted, and given more pay).   
I CAN do a good job at anything, really, I just stop caring when I realize I've gone as high as I'm gunna go. Then what? Trying to figure it out has me stressed, anxious, depressed, short with my family, and just overall miserable.

This is way too long, so I dunno if I'll get any responses or insight, but if anyone's been in a similar boat, or sees something obvious that I'm missing, I would love to hear it.  
Please &amp; Thank you
