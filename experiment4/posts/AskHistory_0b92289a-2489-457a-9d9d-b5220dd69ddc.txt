Did Russia experience anti-war attitudes during/after the cold war like the USA did?
So I'm mostly referring really to a Vietnam type example.  Like the US had drafted troops going half way around the world to fight some horrible war in a jungle where the trees shot back and this war is always presented awfully in TV, media, etc. Is there a soviet example of this? A long slow war with minimal gains that the people disliked? Did Russia even fight many distant wars themselves? Or another anti-war attitude is the modern day thoughts on US CIA operations in Latin America. Were there many destabilizing KGB operations and how are they viewed now? 

I'm not an expert but Afghanistan would be my closest guess for a military operation the Russians fudged up.
