When you're lonely and have no friends, there are certains things which just hit you harder.
When you're so excited about playing a game but then you realize you have no1 to play it with. Or when there's a new movie or tv show that comes out... after years of watching weeks worth of movies and tv shows, you kinda want to be able to watch it along with someone and talk about it.  
No matter how hard we try and control that horrible feeling of extreme loneliness there's always something there to trigger it :/
