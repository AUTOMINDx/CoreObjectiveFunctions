After 4 years i'm still not over my bad coming out experience with mother.
First time posting here. 

4 years ago i 'accidentally' came out to my mom. She did not take it well and then i got the silent treatment for a few weeks. Mother forbid me to tell anybody so i didn't. It's still my secret. 
After the weeks of silent treatment she came to me and said horrible things to me and how wrong i am. I prefer not to go too much in detail here but yea it sucks. 

Now a few years later i'm studying far away enough from them that i don't have to worry too much, but it's still eating me up inside. I can't hold a normal conversation with them because i just feel blocked and frozen and i'm still very angry. 

My apologies for this sad post, but i needed to share because i'm feeling quite lonely lately. 

I hope everyone is having a good day/night.
