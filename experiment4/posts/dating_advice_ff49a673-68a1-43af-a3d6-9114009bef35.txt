Why is dating as a virgin so hard?
I’m 21F, still a virgin and trying to get into a serious relationship. What I have noticed is that most men are not willing to wait for me to be ready to have sex with them or some of them don’t even believe me at all! I am not necessarily waiting for marriage but I would prefer to do it in a long-term committed relationship with someone who I trust. So far the men I’ve been with are constantly trying to push my boundaries which is annoying so I don’t know if I’m asking for too much. 

Is being a virgin at 21 really that big of a deal breaker or am I just dating men who don’t like me enough to wait?
