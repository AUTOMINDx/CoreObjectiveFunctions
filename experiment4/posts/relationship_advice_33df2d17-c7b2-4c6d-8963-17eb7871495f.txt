My boyfriend went to his best friends wedding with all married people now he is extra lovey dovey
Here it goes. My amazing boyfriend went to his best friends wedding back east and when he came back he mentioned how all of his friends are either married with families, engaged or just got divorced. He said it made him think that he is at the age where he thinks maybe he isn’t in the same… idk same group as them. We have a great relationship but ever since he’s come back he is extra lovey dovey which I’m not complaining because I love it!! But it makes me wonder because I feel like this is a whole new man but can’t understand why… maybe someone has some input.
