My grandparents are getting a divorce and It doesn’t feel real.
My grandparents announced to my mom and my two aunts that they were getting a divorce. My mom and aunts are shocked and very sad about, so am I. My grandmother said that she “wanted a new life.” They are both in their mid 60’s I think and their relationship has been going downhill for years. I know it’s for the best but it’s very surprising and saddening. If anyone has any advice to overcome this that would be awesome. Thank you.
