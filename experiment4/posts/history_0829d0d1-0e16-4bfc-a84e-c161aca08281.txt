Nero (37-68) and the titles “Germanicus” and “Armeniacus”
Why was the title Germanicus (on coins, inscriptions) attributed to emperor Nero even though he didnt had a military campaign/ victory over the Germanic people. I know he got it because of his ancestor that had a major victory over the Germanics under August. But are there any other specific reasons? And why did he get the title Armeniacus even though he didnt achieve full domination and total victory over Armenia in the end?
