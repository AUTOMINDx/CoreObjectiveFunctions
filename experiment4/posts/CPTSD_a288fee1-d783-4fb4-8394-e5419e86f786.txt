Has anyone been bullied/criticized for being “arrogant/showing off” something that you’re naturally talented at or worked hard at, and you internalized it and stopped doing it as well so you don’t come off arrogant anymore?
Back story: I’ve always been really good at dance. For a very shy kid, it gave me confidence and made me really happy through an abusive childhood. 

During rehearsalyears ago, I had just finished my turn practicing (we were going in groups). And one of my “friends” was watching me. After I finished and sat down with her she said condescendingly, “why do you always go so hard?” To which I was genuinely shocked and asked what. I was beaming after the rehearsal and suddenly felt it fall. She said “I’m just saying, you don’t have to show off all the time. You’re making others feel bad. It’s arrogant. It’s only rehearsal.” I was a kid and it really broke me to hear that. 

I know now it came from a place of jealousy and I cut her off for other toxic behavior a few years later.

But it stuck with me. Any advice how to heal this part?
