Even if we teach men not to rape, the fear will never go away, right?
This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while. Even if we do improve as a society, and adequately teach men consent and personal boundaries, there’s still the basic biological reality that almost any man can overpower almost any woman. I’m a man, so I can’t speak for women, but the hypothetical thought that any *woman* could be capable of overpowering me at any time, for any reason, and I would have to be totally dependent on her to be a decent enough person not to, is enough to instill some existential dread. That feeling probably wouldn’t go away even if in this role-reversed world women were better taught boundaries.
Am I overthinking this, or is this something that women have to contend with forever?
