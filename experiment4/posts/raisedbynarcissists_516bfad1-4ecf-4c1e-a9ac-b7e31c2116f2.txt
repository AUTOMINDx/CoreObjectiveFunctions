Why are people so obsessed over me forgiving my abusers?
I am 100% that I’m not the only one who has explained that they didn’t have a good childhood to someone, only for the listener to comment something like:

“I’m sure they were trying their best. You should forgive them.”

Words like this hurt a lot, but I don’t blame the other person. We’re all human, and all humans have these little mental models of how things work. Gravity is a good example (ignoring the details of how it actually works), it’s extremely intuitive that objects tend to fall down when nothing is below them. If someone went up to you and insisted that they just dropped their keys and they fell *up* and not down, you may assume that they were:

1) Joking

2) Lying

3) Misunderstanding what actually happened

Likewise, the idea of a healthy family dynamic is something that (for those lucky enough to have one) may be equally intuitive. I feel like people just don’t/can’t get the sad fact that not all parents are good. **When we open to them, we’re challenging their entire worldview**. It is an easier option to decide that, rather than their worldview that they grew up with be wrong/inaccurate, the abuse we described to them just didn’t happen in the way perceived it to.

Going back to the title of the post, I still hate when people insist I forgive my parents. They, especially my mom, did a lot of bad things that eventually caused me to suffer in a lot of ways. I have no reason to forgive them, just like they had no reason to do all the things they did.

Edit: I want to reply to a lot of comments, but there’s quite a few. I have read pretty much everything so far, if that helps.
