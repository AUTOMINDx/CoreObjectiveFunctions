How can I be my true self and stop pretending to be someone else sometimes out of fear of judgement or criticism?
I tend to not be who I truly am sometimes because I am worried about how people will judge or criticize me. I feel like I am not my authentic true self at certain times out of fear or being judged or criticized. I feel like I worry about trying to get other people to like me as well. This has become a problem for me because I do things that I don't want to really do out of fear, judgment, criticism and being liked. How can I say what I truly want to say and do what I truly want to do and not pretend to be someone else?
