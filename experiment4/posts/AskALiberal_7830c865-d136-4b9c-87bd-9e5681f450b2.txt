How do progressives and Democrats overcome the "soft on crime" label they receive
Here in LA, DA George Gascon has been an endless punching bag by everyone not progressive. His role in eliminating bail has people claiming this is causing our current crime wave (when some crimes are up, some are down, and it's really the media picking up more visually stunning versions of robbery as of recent plus LAPD feeding into this.)

So I ask humbly, how do progressives shake this label put on them by others, what facts and statistics should we point out to explain that "No, progressives are just as tough on crime as conservatives are, if not sometimes more so."
