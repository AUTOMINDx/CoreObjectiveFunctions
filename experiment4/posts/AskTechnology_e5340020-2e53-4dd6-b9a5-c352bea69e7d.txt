Creepy IT Guy, please help!
The IT guy at the company I work at is incredibly creepy and gross in an incel-y kind of way. But before I was aware of his questionable character, I had him fix my mac laptop. I am considering doing a computer information reset/wipe in order to get rid of any possible spyware and software he may have installed on my computer. Other than that, is there anything else I can do? Are there any hardware related things I should check in order to be safe?

Thanks in advance!
