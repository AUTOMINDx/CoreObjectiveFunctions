Total Apathy
My mother was completely emotionally unavailable. I cant remember ever being hugged (not to say it never happened but obviously so little that the memory never stuck), deep parentification both dealing with my mother's weird psychological problems as well as being a parent to my sister who is 10 years younger than me, general instability and neglect due to addiction issues and traumatic rage episodes. I grew up an absolute mass and made many unhealthy decisions.


I've been working with a therapist for a while to gain a healthier state of mind and I'm generally happy and content with my life.


During these sessions I also realised I have no feelings whatsoever towards my mother. Not anger nor love. She's like a total stranger to me.


I didn't make the conscious decision to go NC but just generally stopped making an effort. The response I got was. ...nothing. Not that I was in any doubt that I made the right move but it certainly helps.


The most difficult part of this  is the loneliness I feel at not having any friends who understand (thankfully! I wouldn't wish my childhood on my friends) in a deep, comprehensive way what the effects of having an emotionally neglectful parent has. I'm still working on that one.


I wish all of you a gentle journey to the emotionally healthy and fulfilling lives we all deserve.
