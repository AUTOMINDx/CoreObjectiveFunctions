How to deal with intense Sunday Night anxiety?
Do you guys feel intense work anxiety on Sunday night or even the afternoon? If so, how do you deal with it? I tried doing relaxing things like playing games, drawing, yoga, watching movies, but nothing seem to help and I can't stop worrying about work. It's even 4 am right now and I can't even fall asleep.

Edit: Wow, thank you for all of the replies. I'm going to give some of your suggestions a try, including finding the root of my anxiety.
