Trying to be compassionate, but secretly loving karma
My husband threw his back out this morning. I got him painkillers, gave him one of my muscle relaxants (yeah, yeah, yeah, I know), got him onto the couch. I let him vent to me about feeling useless and the frustration of having the motivation to get stuff done but not being able to. Then I kindly told him that this is exactly what is like for me when I'm having problems with my back, which I have been, consistently, for the last several weeks. Then there's the other things I didn't say... like "but this will go away after a couple of days at the longest, whereas I've been having my back pain off and on for several years now." Or "I've learned how to just function while in pain, maybe you should try that." In the future, I will be reminding him this experience every time he complains about me not doing more around the house. 

Ahh, karma.
