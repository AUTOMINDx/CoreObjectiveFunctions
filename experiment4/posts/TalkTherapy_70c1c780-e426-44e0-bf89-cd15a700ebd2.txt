Feeling off about therapy.
Hi all. I know this has probably been said 1,000 times on this sub, but I don’t feel like therapy in general is genuine. I almost can’t get past the fact that it’s so one sided. I tell this person every detail of my life, meanwhile all info I have about them is what I can find online.  I’m too shy to ask them anything about themselves, because I’m afraid to make them uncomfortable. I know I should bring this up with them, and I will, but I don’t know if they’ll be able to change my mind.. 

if therapy works for you, I’m jealous. I’m so jealous.
