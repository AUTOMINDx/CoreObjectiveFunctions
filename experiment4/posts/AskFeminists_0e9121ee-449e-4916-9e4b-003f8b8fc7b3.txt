What are some of the primary reasons men tend to take more risks than women do?
It's interesting how men tend to take more risks in our society (U.S.) across seemingly unrelated domains. Men have been shown to be riskier drivers than women. Men also tend to  make much riskier choices in investing (most people I see/know who invest in crypto, meme stocks, or engage in "YOLO investing" have been men). Men also have shorter lifespans than women in part due to risky behavior.

My biggest guess on why this is would be because men are much more pressured to outperform and outcompete others than women are. This generally involves taking risks. One benefit of deconstructing the patriarchy would be removing this pressure so many men face.  


No doubt there are multiple factors though. What's your take?
