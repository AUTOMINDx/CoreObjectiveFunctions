Anyone else feel like they’re playing Russian Roulette whenever they drink?
I (24f) am the product of two alcoholic parents, and have other alcoholic family members. As such I am aware that my risk to develop alcoholism is quite high, and I was often warned about the possibility during adolescence. My Dad likes to say that “once a cucumber turns into a pickle, it can’t turn back.” which is his way of saying that once someone becomes an alcoholic they can’t go back.

It didn’t really concern me much when I was in college, I didn’t drink much compared with many of my peers. But recently I’ve been drinking more frequently  than before (and more casually) while I doubt it’s something a person without a family history would worry about I tend to obsess over it. I feel guilty when I even think about wanting to drink, wondering if that desire is normal or if it makes me an alcoholic. It’s like playing Russian roulette…i’m never sure if or when my drinking will spiral out of control, I’m just terrified of becoming like my parents. 

Does anyone else feel this way? If you do, how do you cope?

TLDR: I am a casual/social drinker with alcoholic parents and am terrified of ending up like them someday.
