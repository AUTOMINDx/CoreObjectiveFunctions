Is it normal to have zero friends as an adult?
I'm in my late 20s and have no friends, and I have no idea if this is how it is for everyone or not. I haven't had any friends in years, and I spend all of my time at home sleeping when I'm not at work. I realized recently that everyone who pretends to be interested in what someone else is talking about is just putting on an act to seem friendly, nobody actually cares about anyone else as an adult. 

Is it normal to have no friends? Are real friends even possible as an adult?
