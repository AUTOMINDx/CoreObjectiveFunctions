Any tips on answering competency questions in interviews?
I have real difficulty questions which involve stuff like "tell me about a time when..." 

I have enough experience and I know I should be able to answer them well but I think I get panicky and nervous, and it's hard for me to give a proper detailed answer about a specific situation.

I'm aware of the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) technique but I find it really hard to apply in a granular way to my every day work experience. I take too much of an overview.

Does anyone have any tips to help make this easier for me?

Thank you!
