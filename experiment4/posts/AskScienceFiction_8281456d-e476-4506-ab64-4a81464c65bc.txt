[Cabin in the Woods] How powerful are the Old Gods? What’s the ecological damage of them emerging? Is all of humanity gonna be tortured to death?
In the movie, when the Old Gods rise, the organization’s director told them that everyone on earth is gonna die a slow painful death if thy rise. Well, as everyone knows, they rise and we see that they’re of colossal size, reminiscent of the Celestials in marvel. Could they be defeated? If not, what exactly is the fate of 8 billion people? Are they all really gonna be tortured to death?

 I imagine it’s a lot like the situation in Doom Eternal, but I’ve always been curious about what happens after the movie ends
