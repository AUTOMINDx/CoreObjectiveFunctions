SIL from hell
So my SIL is an absolute nightmare. She's a narcissist, and very much one of those "Facebook moms" whose whole life is supposedly her kids, but she never does any actual parenting. She's a nightmare and her kids are until they realize how bad their mom is and start acting like decent human beings. I have many many stories about her, but the following is probably my favorite. (Not entirely sure this is the right group but she uses being a parent to way too many kids to justify everything.)

I hate planning parties, especially birthday parties with different sides that dislike each other, etc. They stress me out a lot. My mom rented a hall at a club they belong to for my daughter's birthday. That way I'm not worried about my house being clean enough. I called/texted/or messaged everyone the date and time, and the location. That part is important. So we're going full swing in the party and hubby mentions SIL is late. (Not shocking. At all.) He calls her and she says they're almost there. Except by "there" she meant our tiny little apartment an hour away fron the actual party. He corrects her, she has a full blown hissy fit like I never told her that. When they finally arrive she immediately starts bitching that I never told her, blah blah blah. Now I'm pissed. I go into my messenger and clear as day is the right location. I shoved my phone in her face. Her response? "You should have reminded me." Yes, it is totally my fault that in the midst of my panic attack I didn't think to remind an adult something it took me 2.5 seconds to find. God I hate her.
