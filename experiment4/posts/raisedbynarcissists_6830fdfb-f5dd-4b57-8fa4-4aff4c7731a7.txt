I’m watching the Netflix series “Maid”. This part hit me pretty hard.
For anyone who invalidates their own abuse, claiming “it isn’t/wasn’t that bad”… this scene from the Netflix series “Maid” might resonate with you.

Story: A young mother named Alex takes her toddler and leaves her boyfriend, who has a habit of getting drunk and punching walls, verbally assaulting her, and holding money over her head. He never physically hurts her, though. 

Homeless, jobless, and penniless, Alex  seeks assistance from Social Services. The first visit, the social worker suggests she stay at a domestic violence shelter. Alex declines, claiming she’s not a victim of domestic abuse.

During her next visit, she and the social worker are once again discussing places for Alex to stay. The social worker once again suggests the shelter. 

SOCIAL WORKER: There’s beds at the domestic violence shelter but, uh, you said you’re not DV?
ALEX: Yeah. I would really hate to take a bed from somebody that’s been abused for real.
SOCIAL WORKER: “Abused for real”? What does that mean?
ALEX: Beaten up. Hurt.
SOCIAL WORKER: And what does fake abuse look like? Intimidation? Threats? Control?

Alex doesn’t say anything. She looks away, shaking her head.

Such a great scene. Wonderful writing. I felt it.
