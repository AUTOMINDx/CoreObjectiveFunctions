Animals as an attachment substitute in childhood
Not sure how old was I, but I remember sitting under a cherry tree behind my house, hugging a duck. That animal was amazing and would sit on my lap. We would even nap together! I remember hugging the animal and crying...
I also had pet chickens and baby goats. 
I never looked at it through an emotional neglect lense, but now I question being overly attached to my animals. 
I'm I making up this connection?
