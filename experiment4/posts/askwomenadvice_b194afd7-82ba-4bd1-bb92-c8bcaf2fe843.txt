I have really long hair on my lady parts and i need help shaving it
Okay so I (14F) just started shaving not too long ago and i shave pretty much every part of my body except for my lady parts. 

i started growing hair down there at a pretty young age and i also believe that was the first place i even grew hair. at that time i didn’t have shaving supplies nor was i allowed to do so

because of that the hair down is extremelyyyyyyy long and it’s impossible to shave there with a normal razor and cream unless i trim a lot of it before i shave. 

since i cant shave there it’s causing me a lot of vaginal issues and it’s uncomfortable. 

any advice on how to get rid of the hair completely ?

TLDR; pubes r too long to shave and is causing me issues with my area, need help shaving it off.
