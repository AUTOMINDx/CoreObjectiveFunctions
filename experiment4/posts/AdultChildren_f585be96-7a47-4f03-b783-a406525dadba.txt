Mom fought me for car keys in Belk parking lot
I just need to get this off my chest because this is the worst I’d ever seen her. She goes over to my grandmas this afternoon &amp; around 7 we get a call from my aunt (who lives with grandma) that our mom just left the house in an extremely drunken, fiery rage and refused to not drive home. Only my mom didn’t drive home. She started driving all over the city. My sister &amp; I tracked her on find my friends and finally found her in a neighborhood, driving around. We watched as she almost got into 4 wrecks, drove up on curbs several times &amp; swerved in front of cars. It was horrifying and I didn’t know what to do. Finally she pulled into a belk parking lot and parked. We pulled up beside her and confronted her, asking her to give us the keys so we could drive her home. She insisted she was fine, but was clearly not. She began fighting us, shoving us, trying to slam the car door on us. I finally managed to get the keys from her and got into my own car, and she climbed in after me, fighting for the keys. She told me if I didn’t give her the keys, I would never see her again. Obviously I kept them. I started crying at this point. I didn’t know what to do. Then our mom runs off, and my sister finds her inside of belk. We both follow her around and then a flip switches, and she asks us if we want clearance jewelry that is on sale. She’s fawning over the jewelry and says we can each pick out something we want. Then another flip switches. We get on the escalator to leave the store, she turns around and runs back up. She continued to try to escape us for 45 minutes. Finally we left with her. She asked me for her keys and I refused. Luckily she got in the car with me and let me drive her home. I hated every second of it. I just had to tell some people.
