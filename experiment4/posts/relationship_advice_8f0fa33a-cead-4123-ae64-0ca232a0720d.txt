My boyfriend holds every single thing over my head in relation to the number of sexual encounters we have. I feel like Im being treated as a PC friendly version of a prostitute…LTR (long-term relationship) style.
Hey all. I’m wondering whether I’m in the wrong and he’s in the right about playing the “tit for tat” game with announcing that he ‘did this for me…bought that for me’…”I’m taking this away” etc if we just skip an evening of sex. I’m not a total nympho in this relationship but I like to think I put out at an average level at the least in this very instance. Regardless, I dont think I should have to earn my doggy bone by making sure to provide a satisfying session…OR ELSE. 
It got to the point where he wouldn’t buy me body wash and face wash at Walmart today because there was no action yesterday or today up until that point. Few facts- he is a 43 year old male and I’m a 34 year old female. I’ve also been depending on him for a living situation currently. 
All thoughts welcome! 😘😣
