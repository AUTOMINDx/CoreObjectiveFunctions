Anyone else stop caring about perks and fun office culture?
When I was looking for work after graduating, the cool hipster office with free lunch every day seemed so amazing to me. Now after working for several years and switching jobs a few times, whenever I hear about the free beers and lunch in the office, the parties, the "culture" and the super-cool office with ping-pong I cringe. It doesn't interest me now because I realized that it doesn't make me love my job. It only serves to compensate for bullshit and gaslight you into working there longer. I might just be spoiled after working in this type of office for years. But yeah, I'm pretty much at the point where if they just give me a workstation with a decent computer, 2 monitors, a comfortable chair and a plant I'll be happy as long as I'm not micromanaged. I don't need all the frills. With or without the pandemic, I feel the same way.
