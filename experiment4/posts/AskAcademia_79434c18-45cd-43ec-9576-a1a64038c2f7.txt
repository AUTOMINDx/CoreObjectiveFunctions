How commonly do universities lie about test scores and GPA's?
One of the oldest universities in the country claimed a GMAT score of its accepted students to be over 700 on their website. 

Why would students with 700+ GMAT's join a mid-tier pedestrian college in Virginia when they could easily be accepted by schools like MIT and Stanford with scores as high as that? I was curious. 

Luckily, the Virginia college was a public college, so I sent them a FOIA request as a Virginia resident myself. I got a response from their General Counsel's Office this morning. Here's what their General Counsel told me under FOIA.

Mean GMAT's of accepted students for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 592, 602, 549 and 560. When I checked their website again, they had taken down their 700+ claim.

So, how common is it for universities to lie about test scores and GPA's? Do they lie only to the public or do they also lie to accreditation agencies?
