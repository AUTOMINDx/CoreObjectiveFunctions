Did anyone else use to daydream about being saved by someone when you were younger but have no idea why?
Probably around 12 or 13 I distinctly remember I would start daydreaming of situations where I would be randomly saved from different scenarios. It became a routine that would help me get to sleep.

But they weren't related to anything actually happening to me in real life - it would be things like getting caught out at a bank that was getting robbed, or a school with a shooter (this was before even Colombine). Or even just walking down the street I would imagine myself getting physically stabbed or beat up, but then always someone (usually the male protagonist of whatever show I was into at the time) would come save me. Or I would somehow sacrifice myself so others got away safely.

I always knew as I was thinking them in the back of mind that this was fucked up and probably most people didn't imagine these things, but it somehow brought me comfort.

Looking back now I think it was a cry for help, without actually having anyone to help me :(
