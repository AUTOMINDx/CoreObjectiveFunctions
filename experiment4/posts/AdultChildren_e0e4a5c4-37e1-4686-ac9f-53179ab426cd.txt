My family blamed his abuse on alcohol for so long and now I realize it's all bullshit
My dad is an alcoholic. Every single day without fail he would drink- he usually started around 3 or 4 when he started cooking dinner and would be drunk the rest of the night. I rarely saw him when he was sober especially in my teenage years. 

My dad was also an abuser. He screamed at my sister and I constantly. Dinner was tense every night because he always found some reason to yell at us. My sister and I learned to walk on eggshells but my mom never did and usually was the one to say something that triggered a screaming match. 

My dad always blamed his abuse on the alcohol. "Honey he's just drunk, he doesn't mean it." Things like that. It made me afraid of alcohol because I thought it would turn me into some abusive monster. 

I moved out a few months back and tried alcohol...I've been drunk a few times now. And I realized- bullshit! My dad was abusive because he's abusive. Him being a drunk made it worse but I never acted like him drunk...because I never acted like him sober. He's just a fucking asshole. 

I have a lot of mixed emotions
