Does anyone know how eye trackers calculate where you are looking?
I was just looking up how eye trackers work after watching a video with them in. 

I’m not surprised that they calculate where you are looking on your screen but I don’t really know how.

All I could find online is information from teacuplab.com which said they use Machine learning, image processing and mathematical algorithms.

Sorry if this is obvious and I’m not just seeing it but I have no clue how these things would calculate where you are looking.

Does anyone know how they calculate it?
