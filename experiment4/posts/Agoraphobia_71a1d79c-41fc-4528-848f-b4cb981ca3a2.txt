Why?
Can somebody help me understand WHY do I get anxious at public places? Like yeah I know, it's because I have agoraphobia, and that's propably because I've had panic attacks at those places, but I know all this stuff, and I know that certain places work like a trigger for me, but why does the anxiety begin to build up like automatically every freaking time I try to go to these places? It's just something that I can't avoid no matter what. I've even got to the point where I am fully relaxed when I know I need to go to some of these places and even on my way I may not be scared or anxious at all, but the second I step in to that place, boom, anxiety and fight flight or freeze is fully on. I just don't fucking get it. Why do those places work like a switch that just turn the anxiety on immediately even when I'm supposed to be in a relaxed state?
