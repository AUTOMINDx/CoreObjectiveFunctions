"So brave"
My son (2y) went to the dentist today. He only got his teeth looked at and brushed by the dentist, but to him, it was really scary. He clung tightly to me and cried a lot. I held him during and for a while after, telling him how brave he is and how I know it's scary, but we can get through it together.

No fighting. No withdrawing my love because he wasn't cooperating. No getting mad because he was crying out loud. No invalidating his emotions just because nothing "really" happened. Because to him, that was one of the most terrifying things he's ever done.

When we got home, the first thing he did was run to his dad and say "dentist. So brave". He did the same thing a few weeks ago after he got his flu vaccine and the following week whenever he saw his bandaid.

It's things like these that remind me that I'm not my mother. If that's what he takes out of those experiences, then I'm doing a good job.
