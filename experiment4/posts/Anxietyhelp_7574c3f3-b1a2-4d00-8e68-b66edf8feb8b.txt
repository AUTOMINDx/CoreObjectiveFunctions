I literally can not relax. Please someone help
I'm writing this because I can't fucking take it anymore and I want it to just stop. I'm 27m and for some reason I can't relax or simply slow down. I run 30ish miles a week just to cope with the nervousness and anxiety and when I'm not running I'm anxious sitting there constantly tapping my leg. So I just want to ask can I do anything about this? Is there a medication to stop this level of anxiety? Please let me know if you experience this or someone you know is like this and if they can help. Thank you

Edit: I'm currently taking 80mg of prozac. 4 weeks in now. About to see a therapist
