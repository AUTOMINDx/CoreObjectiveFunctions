Is it normal to not remember most of my past? Like I remember I worked for4 years at this job and lived nearby and did so much from what I remember, but I mentally can’t remember anything. Is this normal?
I don’t remember much of my childhood/my old life and I’m having a hard time remember who I even was before that. I am in therapy and I know I was a big people please, but with friends I forgot to be a friend and I just know that I’m just tired of putting myself out. I’m drained and tired.
