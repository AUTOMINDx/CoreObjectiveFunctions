Is it cruel to break up before Christmas?
Update: thank y’all for the input. I’ll do it in the next couple of days, when we’re both free to get together. It’ll be good for both of us to rip that bandaid off.

I have been dating my boyfriend for about 6 months now. But it’s increasingly obvious to me that he is not the one for me—not because he’s a bad person or anything, I’ve just come to realize he’s not the personality I’m looking for. However he is head-over-heels for me. We’ve said I love you, but now I realize I mixed up infatuation and love. I don’t love him but he loves me. Staying in this relationship is stressing me out because I feel like I’m lying to him. However, I don’t want to break his heart right before Christmas. Should I get him a gift and wait until after the holiday, or should I break it off now and risk ruining his holiday? I still care for him a great deal, and I care about his feelings more than my own, so I want to prioritize him.
