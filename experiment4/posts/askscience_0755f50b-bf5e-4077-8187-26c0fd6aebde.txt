How do drugs know where to go in the body?
First of all, I obviously don't think medicine is actually making the choice of where to go.  

But, if I take (for example) acetaminophen for a sprained ankle, adderall for my adhd, and bupropion and lamotrigine for my bipolar, how does all of that get to where it needs to go? Is it just a matter of getting distributed evenly through the body and then absorbed wherever there happen to be receptors that fit the molecules? Doesn't that end up being really inefficient? -- seems like most of the actual meds would just get filtered out pretty quickly.   

Is that were drug interactions come from? -- multiple drugs competing for the same receptors?  

EDIT: holy crap. I was not expecting this quantity or quality of responses. Seriously, i think I learned more here than an entire semester of biology. Every comment is a gem. Thank you all for your time and energy! It is very appreciated.
