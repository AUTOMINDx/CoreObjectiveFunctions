Need advice on living with a cat, so that I don't end up fighting with fiancé over it
My fiance (32M) has a 7 year old neutered female cat which will be living with us when we get married next year and I am quite concerned as I have never had a mammal for a pet (only had reptiles) . It was also rather unnerving to know that the cat has scratched the fiance multiple times over the years since he adopted her when she was 5 months old. Of the few times I have met the cat, the impression hasn't been that good. She's hissy and cranky, but not at me since I don't interact with her much. Have brushed her a few times and she was calm (thank goodness). The fiance says that she has gotten grumpy with age. 

I don't intend to interact with the cat much when we start living together. I'm indifferent towards cats but I I will not like it at all if it scratches me for no reason (would they scratch for no reason?) The good thing about the cat though, is that she apparently doesn't knock things over, climb on furniture or gets up to any mischief. She is apparently rather elderly too, or so the vet said. 

Has anyone who had to live with their partners' pets (especially cats) have any advice to give such that I co-exist with my fiancé's cat peacefully?
