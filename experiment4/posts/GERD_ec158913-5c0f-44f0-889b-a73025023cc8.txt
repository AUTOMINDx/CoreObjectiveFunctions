anyone get bold sometimes?
My acid reflux has gotten worse since Feb of this year due to antibiotics I took. 

It's been awhile since then and I've taken plenty of probiotics over the months and I think my stomach biome has been getting better.

I still get acid reflux but yesterday I tried Spaghetti Sauce for the first time since April. And I'm currently drinking a Coca-Cola. I didn't get any reflux from the Spaghetti sauce and I don't know at the moment for the Coca-Cola. 

You ever go out of your comfort zone and try things that may give you acid reflux?
