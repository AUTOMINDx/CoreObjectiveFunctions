I am going to give up smartphone and gadgets for 15 days.
I(17F) once jokingly asked a gadget addicted friend to go on a smartphone detox. Guess what? He actually did it. For 15 days. This was a man who went from double digit screentime to almost no screentime. I never gave doing this a real thought myself. But lately I have been super glued to my phone, wasting time endlessly. My screen time averaged to 6-7 hours a day last week! I just realized keeping my day 18 hours long doesn't help if I am just surfing around. I am hoping to be more productive in this period and do things I haven't done before. I want to read more, study more and basically, do more! So as of today, 7th December, I am going to switch off my phone in a few hours and keep it locked up somewhere. It's going to be hard I think. The thought of being in a room of people where everyone's glued to their phone and not having a phone yourself is slightly scary. I will put my simcard in a basic phone for emergency calling purposes. I will use my laptop for an hour daily max only to attend classes or study. I will block netflix and other sites. I will write letters and write in a diary. I will communicate with two people via call. I feel crazy already. And I am shit scared right now, like why should I be doing this? But I am gonna do it. Sounds like an impulsive decision. It is an impulsive decision. I hope I make through it and not give up midway. My parents think I am crazy. Maybe I am. Wish me luck anyways.
