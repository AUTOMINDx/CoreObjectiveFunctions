What should I do if I want my kids to be vaccinated for Covid, but my husband is against it?
We have two daughters, aged 9 and 5. I am fully vaccinated and my husband is not. We have all had covid as well. I want our girls to get the vaccine but he is staunchly against it, saying that he doesnâ€™t think they need it. I have made an appointment with our pediatrician to consult and get his advice, and give my husband the opportunity to ask any questions. What would you do if you were in this situation?
