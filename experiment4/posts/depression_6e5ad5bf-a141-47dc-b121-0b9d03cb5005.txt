The future ain't friendly, and I'm not sure it's for me.
Man, I turn 29 in a week. 30 in a year. I look at the future my generation was promised. What should have been sunny days and happiness is gray and monotonous. Paying to live, looking for joy in material objects. Only way to possible own a house is to ask my step father for help, a thing society says you shouldn't do because of your gender. Real men don't ask for help.

Real men keep the gray pressure pushing at their forehead draining their energy. Go see a therapist, sure. So I can tell them my future looks bleak and they can offer false assurances and recommendations for drugs. I just want to look forward and see the sun. Instead, we snuggle with the corpses of dinosaurs. While we continue to be ruled by geriatric flesh bags.

How do I stop looking into the darkness of the future and focus on the present? When the present doesn't seem to lead anywhere? How do I bring a child into this world? When did I start stressing and worrying about things I never use to? Is this adulthood? Take it back if so, I just wanna imagine making pies outta dirt again.
