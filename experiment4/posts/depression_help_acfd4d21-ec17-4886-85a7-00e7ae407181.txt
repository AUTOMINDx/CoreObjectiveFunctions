Anyone relate to my depression-induced brain fog experience?
My brain has been foggy for years. Slow and hard to think and focus. I think it should be caused by depression. I have ruled out other possible culprits after obtaining blood/hormone test results and adopting lifestyle/diet changes. 

Let me describe my brain fog:
I feel very spacey. I have to consciously and deliberately think all the time to be marginally functional. My unconscious does not feed information into my consciousness - that is say, nothing would pop into my mind and I have to actively think by prompting questions to myself to be a minamally functioning person. My head also feels numb. Thinking needs to be so deliberate that I feel so spiritually tired to be at work. 

As said, I have been depressed for a long time, and I think my brain has already gone through some structural changes, such that the brain fog I have presists even without a lot of rumination of negative thoughts. I feel so hopeless sometimes.
