Find yourself someone who’s actually excited to be with you
I spent far too long trying to force it with people who were clearly disinterested, trying to justify why they didn’t try to arrange plans or didn’t seem to ask me questions. Basically they had me on the back burner. 

Find yourself someone who actually puts in reciprocal effort and seems excited to spend time with you.

Most won’t, but that’s ok.

Life is too short to spend it on those who don’t respect you or your time 

I’m sure I’ll slip up because this stuff isn’t logical, but I’ll try to remind myself of this as often as possible
