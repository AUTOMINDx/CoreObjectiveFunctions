Reminder: take care of the child in you
Hey, guys. I felt like sharing a part of the book I am reading right now with you all.  

"It can be very painful to be told that you are not likely to receive from your parents the love, attention, and validation you missed out on as a child, no matter how hard you try to please your parents today. Many who were neglected or abandoned spend their entire lives looking to their parents or others to give to them today what they didn’t get as a child. Some stay tied to their neglectful parents and continue to suffer from the pain of rejection, abandonment, or disappointment. Others have the expectation that others should take away their pain. This causes them constant disappointment as well as further experiences of rejection and abandonment. I want to save you from both of these tragedies. The best way to do this is to stress to you that you absolutely must stop expecting others to take care of you. Even though no one else can give you what you missed as a child, this doesn’t mean you are doomed to never receive it. There is one person who can give you what you missed out on—what you so desperately need and desire. That person is you. The adult part of you—that part who had to grow up even though you didn’t get what you needed to do so—can begin to take care of the needy child in you. The adult part takes care of business, gets up to go to work every day, pays the bills, and puts a roof over your head. This adult part of you can begin to take care of the child part of you—the part who feels helpless, afraid, deprived, and unloved."

The book is called: "Healing Your Emotional Self: A Powerful Program to Help You Raise Your Self-Esteem, Quiet Your Inner Critic, and Overcome Your Shame"

Take care!
