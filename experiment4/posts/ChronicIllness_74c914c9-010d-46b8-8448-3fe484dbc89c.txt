UPDATE: I’ve had an AMAZING doctor for the past 5 years, she’s the best doctor I’ve ever had. I found out today that I’m being forced out as a patient (among many others), because I’m poor and disabled.
So, I sent a polite email to my doctor inquiring about being dropped as a patient, who ALWAYS responds. She never responded. So either she’s been instructed not to interact with “previous” patients, (I’m still technically her patient until January) or she’s a fucking coward. 

I was also told I’d be emailed a list of doctors that would take me, since I am too poor to remain being a patient as a member. They are ALL practices that DO NOT ACCEPT INSURANCE and require memberships to be treated. 

I am so fucking done. Medicare gives me access to doctors that are too ignorant/egotistical/ indifferent/ uneducated/ sexist/ lacking empathy to even waste my time on most of them. I have no idea where to go from here. I feel so betrayed. I am severely chronically ill, disabled, and I’ve been left high and dry by the best doctor I ever had.
