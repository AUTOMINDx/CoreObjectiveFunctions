Heart rate
I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience.. every since I developed severe reflux/indigestion I’ve noticed my heart rate gets VERY high sometimes, but especially when physically exerting myself. Like if I’ve eaten somewhat recently, and then run up my stairs, my heart will be absolutely racing. As if I just did a crazy cardio workout. Today after breakfast I was playing fetch with my dog and it was beating so fast that I had to sit down. And of course I get a lot of palpitations but I know that’s pretty common. Anyone else? (I’ve had all the tests done on my heart and it’s fine)
