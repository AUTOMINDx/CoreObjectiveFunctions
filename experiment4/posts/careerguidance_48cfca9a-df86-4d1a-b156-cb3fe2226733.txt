Better offer to retain me after resigning. Shall I stay?
I am with this org for more than 6 years now. In the last couple of years I started looking for a job as I was not getting any growth.  I asked for better grade and pay but no one responded until I resigned.

During the notice period my current org came back with the offer to retain me with higher grade and pay better than the new offer that I have.

If I take back my resignation, I will need to notify my new employer and disregard the employment agreement that I have signed (legal?). To me this is non-ethical option. But I am getting better pay and stability by staying. New org provides me better learning opportunity and decent pay.  Note: My job search journey started for getting growth.

Any thoughts?
