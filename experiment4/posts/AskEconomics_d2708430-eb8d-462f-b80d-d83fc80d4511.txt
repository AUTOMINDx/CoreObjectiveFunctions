What would happen if the entire tax system was based off asset values?
The most common endorsement of taxing unrealized gains I’ve seen is that real estate is taxed as an asset who’s value has been assessed, so doing the same with stocks has some precedent.

My question would be if all assets were the only things taxed, and with overall tax revenue was equal, what would be the impact on the economy?

I would guess that people would be less likely to hoard assets purely to push off a tax bill, and there would be more buying and selling in the market.
