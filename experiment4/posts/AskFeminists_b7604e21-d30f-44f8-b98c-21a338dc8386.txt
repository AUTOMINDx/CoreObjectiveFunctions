Where to learn about feminism without falling down the anti- feminist rabbit hole?
I would like to learn more about feminism without falling down the anti feminist rabbit hole again. When I was a junior in high school, up to my freshmen year in college, I fell for the anti feminist content that was fed to me via YouTube. Now that I took a gender studies course in college I realized how the content creators I was watching, like shoe0nhead, Lauren Chen, Mr.Repzion, etc. don’t/didn’t know 99% of what they were talking about and misinformed their audience.

I would like to learn more about gender studies and sexuality outside of my university of course.
