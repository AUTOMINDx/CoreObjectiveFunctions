Am I wasting my therapists time when I can’t leave my situation?
I’ve been with my T now for almost two years and the better part of this entire year has been just keeping my sorry depressed ass alive and moving forward while dealing with an abusive relationship. Most sessions are just current things. Most sessions I’m showing up without an agenda other than some sense of safety with another human. Some sessions are me trying to figure out how safety actually feels. I’m not really getting better in my life but also know that’s mostly because of my home situation and I can’t get out yet but this makes me think I should quit until I’m out. Would it better for me and my T to postpone therapy until I am out of my relationship and can actually progress and not be such a failure?
