recovered 2 years now, used to be on this subreddit daily, you’re all going to make it
hey guys, i used to be on here near daily i think this subreddit had maybe like 10k-20k people in it at the time, crazy how much it’s grown, i made a post last year letting you all know it’s been a year since it ended for me and it will end for you as well.

around the end of 2015 i smoked weed for the very first time, i was 15 years old, 2 months after my mom died, sent me into a spiraling panic attack unlike anything i’ve ever felt before it felt like the closest to losing all reality i’ve ever gotten

i eventually calmed down but something felt off? i couldn’t pinpoint it and turned to google and around this time the most info there was was a few forum websites, some niche youtube channels, and this subreddit

so began my journey into hell for the next 4.5 years 2015-2019 i experienced daily panic attacks, unable to drive, questioning my entire reality, feeling like an alien, people looking like aliens, nothing making sense, 8 hours a day reading about it, just complete and utter hell that i’m sure you all know about

there were people who said it was permanent and hopeless and stories of those who recovered and stories of those who didn’t know what to believe.

but i made it, i’m here, and i haven’t had a single DPDR moment since 2019

the way i got better was just living, get off this subreddit and everything else and never come back, i’m fine to come here now but i don’t want to stay just in case, DPDR Is 30% anxiety 30% ocd and 30% trauma, heal one of these and you’re free. the reason you don’t hear many success stories is because once people recover they want bothing to ever do with this disorder again and are afraid of even coming back, live everyday like you don’t give a single fuck literally that’s all there is to it and then one day you wake up and you realize you haven’t been dissociated in months

love you all,
