Whenever I get a notification, I uselessly hope that it’s someone texting me.
Edit: if you won’t be supportive please don’t comment, I can handle the criticism and apply it any other day, just not when struggling and mid crisis
I have always been socially awkward, but I still have a few friends. The things is, I always am the one reaching out. If I don’t talk to them, they truly will forget I exist unless they need something from me.
The thing is that I’m struggling with my mental health. I always have, but the last month it’s gotten worse. It’s so hard for me to tell anyone because I feel like a burden, but I’ve been so bad that I have. But I receive no response. Two weeks ago I asked if anyone could receive me in their home because I had tried to kill myself in mine (and my mom just got angry at me so I needed some support) and no answer. Now I reached out because I’m feeling the urge again but no one cares.
At first I thought it was because I was a bit vague, maybe they didn’t understand what I meant. But shouldn’t they still care if one of their “friends” says she is crying so hard she can’t breathe?
