Looking for tips on reading dense material with ADHD/poor reading comprehension
I've always enjoyed philosophy, but I struggle to read, understand, and retain just about anything that's not a pop-philosophy book. I was somehow able to get a PhD in math so I'm not dumb, but it's always been a struggle to 'read to learn'. I'd really like to be able to sit down with something like Kant and understand his writing enough to engage in some sort of mental dialogue with his work.

I'm sure there are philosophers on here that have had to overcome similar difficulties, and I'd love to hear any pointers from them.
