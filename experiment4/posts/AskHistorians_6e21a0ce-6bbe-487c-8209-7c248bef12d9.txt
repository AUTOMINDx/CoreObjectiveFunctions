How did George H.W. Bush manage to lose the 1992 election after the success of Desert Storm?
Desert Storm is mostly forgotten at this point, but it really is one of the greatest triumphs in American history. The entire international community viewed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as illegitimate, and the US built a multi-nation coalition to oust Saddam's forces. Everything followed international law: Iraq ignored multiple UN Security Council resolutions to leave Kuwait, and rejected peaceful solutions to the conflict. 

And it wasn't obvious that victory would be so easy. [People on both sides of the aisle opposed the invasion — Ted Kennedy and Patrick Buchanan, for example — and Kennedy predicted 3000 US casualties per week.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/20/the-gulf-war-in-retrospect/) Iraq had the 4th largest military in the world at that point, and it was very experienced after having fought a 10-year war against Iran. Nevertheless, when the coalition invaded, the fighting was over after about 100 hours, and around 100 US combatants were killed. There must've been widespread celebration.

[When we look at historic approval ratings, it seems that Bush's was at about 85% when Desert Storm happened, but by 1992, it had fallen below 50%.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/) What happened? Why wasn't Desert Storm a lasting political victory for Bush? Why did his approval fall so suddenly, and how did he wind up losing to Clinton in '92?
