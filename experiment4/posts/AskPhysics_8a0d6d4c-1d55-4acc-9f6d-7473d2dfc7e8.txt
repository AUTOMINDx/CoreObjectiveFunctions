Are stable isotopes fundamentally stable? Or could they just have half-lives too large for us to determine?
I know the stability of the proton is still an open question, but even assuming it is, is there anything about atomic theory that suggests that there's a clear distinction between stable and unstable isotopes?

To put it another way: are their any quantum phenomenon that can cause "stable" atoms to decay?

Bismuth was thought to be stable until 2003, when it was found to be radioactive.  If the only thing that keeps us from classifying the "stable" isotopes as radioactive is a lack of experimental evidence, then should the classification even exist at all?  For all useful purposes, Bismuth may as well be stable; if there's no way of saying with confidence that lead or other elements aren't just extremely long lived, then why draw the distinction at Bismuth?
