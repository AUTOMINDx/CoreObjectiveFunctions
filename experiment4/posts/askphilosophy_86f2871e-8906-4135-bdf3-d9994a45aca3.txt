I am a beginner who's interested in Heidegger. Can you help me?
Hello everyone.

Well, they say when you want to read and learn something, start with what interests you. I am interested in Heidegger. Deeply. But I am afraid that I lack the knowledge. so I don't want to misunderstand him and his ideas. I always wanted to get into philosophy, but nothing that philosophy asked really made me super interested or invested. I was sometimes interested in stoicism but found it hard to achieve and lost interest with time despite watching a lot of videos about it. I also read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and liked it, but stoicism didn't stick with me much. My passion is movies, I found myself interested in movies that represent vague obscure ideas about life or persons or person's relationships which eventually lead me to some talk about Heidegger. My interest in Heidegger is real and I plan to dedicate self-studying time to understand him. So for someone who doesn't know much about philosophy, where should I start? A path that should eventually lead to Heidegger. Who do I need to know about before him? And what books should I read for them? or can I just delve into Heidegger as a beginner?
