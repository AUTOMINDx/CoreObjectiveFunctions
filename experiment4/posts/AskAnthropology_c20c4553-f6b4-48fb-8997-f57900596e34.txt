Struggling with what career path to take
Hello everyone, I’m 21M and I’ve always been interested in social issues and especially languages cultures geography and ethnicities from around the world I know a great deal about my home country just from my own curiosity I tend to research a lot on these types of topics, I first did business in university for two years then left it but now I am an electric apprentice currently working around Europe its good job and after four years it’ll pay very well, I also studied for a month this year of social science but had to drop out due to travelling it was a night time course but the hours didn’t work with it which was a huge shame as it would of been great for me but what I’m trying to say is I’m stuck between pursuing my hobby as a career or doing a trade which I don’t mind it’s not like I hate it It’s interesting I have good fun with co workers but I feel like by not pursing the one thing I’m so interested in I’m gonna regret it in years to come I really don’t know what to do I also feel like if I was to do an Anthropology degree it would take 4 years and feel like I’ll be old finishing at 26 I know it’s stupid ! The degree sounds so interesting too.

I also want to know as I’ve seen a lot on Reddit people saying it’s a “useless degree with no jobs after it”? Is this true or not ? I don’t know what career I would even like after it I feel like it may have lots of options if someone could explain to me what typical careers are after it please let me know I just want to know more about it incase I do decide to go for it next year thank you very much to anyone who replies !
