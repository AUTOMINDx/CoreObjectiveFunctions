DAE Have an obsessive need to have people validate your trauma?
I'm so obsessed with having people in my life recognize that what happened to me was indeed objectively horrible and caused/causes me pain. I think because my parents would constantly gaslight and control every single one of my thoughts, feelings, needs. They would abuse, humiliate, insult, project on to me then turn around and be astounded that I was ruined by it. I would beg and plead with them to stop. They never did. I think this is at the core of my need to have others tell me that what I went through was actually that bad and that I have every right to be torn apart by it, that I'm correct in cutting contact with them. I often don't even trust my own inner voice and thoughts because of this. Yet I know...I KNOW what happened to me was abuse and that I have every right to make the decisions I have made...logically anyway...but that side rarely prevails. Does anyone else struggle with validation?
