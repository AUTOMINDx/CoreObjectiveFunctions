There is a problem with me if my sister’s success bothers me. Help
My younger sister is graduating this month with a BS in Criminal Justice. She plans to go to law school next year, become an attorney, and open her own practice one day.

I know she deserves this. She is very smart, super passionate about justice, and I have no doubt that she will accomplish her dreams. I am so proud of her! She’s told our friends and family all about her goals and everyone is happy for her too. 

I’m trying not to be jealous of her success. And the more I think about it, it’s not her success or potential that bothers me, it’s the fact that she is following her passion and I am not.

I am 3 years older, graduated with a BA in International Studies. I’m now a Consultant for a software company. I’m not passionate about my job or field. If I had known what I know now, and I was more sure of myself, I would have studied something else and I think I would be happier. Everyday I wish I could break in to a new field.

So my sister is not the problem, but seeing someone so close to me live their dream while I can’t figure out how to get to mine bothers me. Need advice on a new mindset and deeper perspective.
