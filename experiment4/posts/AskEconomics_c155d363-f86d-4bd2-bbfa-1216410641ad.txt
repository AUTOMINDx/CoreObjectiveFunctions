Does labour flexibility promote economic growth?
I've been searching in Google Scholar but I can't find anything solid and conclusive. By further looking at the OECD list on labour flexibility, I can't take any conclusive results either, because for example Venezuela and Germany appear on the top with the most protective labour laws.

Are there any meta-studies or conclusive research on this subject? Does labour flexibility promote economic growth? Is there any measurable elasticity between them?
