I feel like I'm qualified to do something, but can't find anything.
Hello. I'm 30, I don't have a career, not for the lack of trying, but I just can't get any interest. I've generally lost a lot of my drive, and my resume keeps looking worse and worse as I get further from college and I don't gain any real experience. A quick rundown. I have a 4 year degree in intelligence analysis. I have a US gov clearance. I worked as a private investigator for just under 3 years. I worked on drones in the military for a few years. I currently work as an executive assistant (fancy title for secretary) doing nothing much other than controlling calendars. I make barely enough to feed myself and live with a roommate to pay the bills. A lot of my resume outside of that was working as a security guard because I just couldn't find other work.

Someone told me recently that I was lying to them that I had such a resume and couldn't find a better job. And I wonder if they're right or not. I don't know what other people do really or have done. I met someone recently who was a "senior analyst" but never had an analyst job in their life before that. I regularly go on dates with women in their mid 20's who make twice the salary I make and I've been made fun of for it. 

I really don't know what I'm supposed to be doing or what jobs I should be applying for. My college never gave me any help. People tell me to apply for intel analyst jobs as if those are easy jobs to get. I've been rejected by every 3 letter agency you can think of at least twice. What if I'm just a loser? What should I do with my life if I'm a loser? Are there loser jobs out there?
