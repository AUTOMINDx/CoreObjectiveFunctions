this sub desperately needs pinned threads
so this has been bothering me about this sub, i find that the general reddit format is detrimental to how useful this sub COULD be for dpdr sufferers, if not actively harmful for dpdr sufferers. it ends up being a laundry list of negative dpdr experiences, which for people with dpdr can just be triggering and make them feel worse. I've spoken to people who decided there's no hope because they read one post that said there's no cure.

there is a lot of experience and wisdom on here, but it gets completely lost in the noise of people's day to day. i see a lot of the same kind of posts that i get are coming from a place of hurt, but for someone with dpdr reading who is naive (coupled with fast onset and debilitating symptoms), I can see it being terrifying. dpdr is so bizarre and unique amongst more commonly understood mental health issues like depression and anxiety that i think it warrants special considerations. this is not in any way a criticism of those posts, but we could be using pinned posts to highlight some of the big recommendations and compiled experiences of treatments that have worked, success stories, resources, research, FAQs, etc. there was a pinned post from a mod a while back, it addressed the notion of people "just accepting it", it was good advice. having a few positive/helpful/resource pinned posts that people coming into the sub would see first I think would be legitimately beneficial to a lot of people. they could be cycled or refreshed periodically, but even something saying, "this is a recognized disorder, everything you're experiencing can be explained, you're not dying or in hell" I think would go a long way towards helping people.
