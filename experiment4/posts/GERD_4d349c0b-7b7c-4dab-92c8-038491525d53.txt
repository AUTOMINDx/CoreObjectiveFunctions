Constipation from PPI use?
Does anyone have constipation from taking PPIs?

Starting about a year ago, I've been chronically constipated.  I've been drinking a gallon of water every day for the past two weeks and eating fibrous foods... and cannot find relief.  Then, I recently read online that PPIs may be stripping the magnesium from my body, which is responsible for bowel contractions and water absorption of the colon.  Whenever I do go, my stool is small, hard, dehydrated-looking pellets.  It makes absolutely no sense considering my diet and the amount of water I'm drinking.  Any ideas?
