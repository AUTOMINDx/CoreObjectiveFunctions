First visit giving the therapist a reference sheet from my problems and the people in my life.
I'm starting therapy again, and I typed up a reference sheet. I want to give it to my therapist at our first visit, but I don't know if that is appropriate. The reference sheet a different main categories example, family, romantic relationships, alcohol/drugs, etc. With subcategories for each main category. I thought it would be helpful so the therapist could be all caught up on my life.
