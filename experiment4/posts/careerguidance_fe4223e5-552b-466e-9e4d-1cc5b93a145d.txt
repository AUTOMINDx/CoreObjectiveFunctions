Recently accepted a new job but current employer asking me to delay handing in my notice due to staffing issues - is this appropriate?
Been with my current employer a year and recently successfully interviewed for a role with a different employer. Yet to hand in my notice as awaiting pre employment checks to clear. 

Today I received a call from a senior manager asking me to consider delaying handing in my notice as my line manager had been recently diagnosed with cancer. They want me to stick around and man the fort whilst the treatment options and staffing situation becomes clearer.

The new job comes with a &gt;20% salary increase and I am hoping to apply for a mortgage next year (after a 6 month probationary period) so any delays here would mean my plans would get postponed. 

As selfish as it may seem, I am keen to start my new role ASAP and progress with my plans to get on the property ladder. What would you do in this scenario? TIA
