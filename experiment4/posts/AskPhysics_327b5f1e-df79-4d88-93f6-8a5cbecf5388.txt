How far away would you have to be to see light travel in space?
So the question pops into my head every time I watch Star Wars 7 when they turn on the dreaded laser from star killer base which goes on to wipe out several planets. The scene cuts to several scenes where you can see the laser beam actually traveling across the sky. My question is three fold, how far away would you have to be to watch a concentrated beam of light (like a laser) progress forward like that? How concentrated/bright would the beam of light have to be? And is this even possible at all?

If I used words improperly that’s my bad but I’m not super science inclined as I’m asking a question I’m pretty sure the response is going to be that “it’s impossible.”
