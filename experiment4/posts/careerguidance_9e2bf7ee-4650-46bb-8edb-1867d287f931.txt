Where can I learn to communicate in a professional and articulate manner?
I feel I have a very poor vocabulary, and I want to try and fix that. I want to try and move up in life, but I can't do that if I sound like Charlie Day from It's Always Sunny. I want to sound more articulate and confident. Yeah I know I guess I could go to college for that, but I'm working a lot and I'm also going through financial hardship, so that's not going to work out for me. 

Where else could learn to speak in a more professional manner?
