Is there any morally good response to, “why do you eat meat?”
Let’s face it, unless you are the small percentage of people who actually kill their own food, you’re buying from stores.

Most of which are supporting factory farming, and even those which don’t, still aren’t that great.

I was asked why I ate meat recently and I have to say…I didn’t really have an answer other than, “because I like it” or, “because I’ve always eaten it”.

I tried to come back with things like, “well there is a hierarchy called the food chain…” and ,” the minute animal products become unavailable, is the minute I become vegan”. But I still didn’t really have a solid answer from a morality standpoint.

So other than just accepting that I’m just compliant in the mass torture and murder of innocent animals, raised to be nothing but good….

What is your response to being asked, “why do you eat meat?
