This healing shit really be taking forever don't it.
I haven't been to work for a week. I got COVID (yes it still exist and it sucks. I'm fully vaccinated and I still suffered, but I'm okay now) anyways that's not the issue. But those feelings that was suppressed will come swimming to the surface when you're seating with your feelings and when you're not occupied. I've been single for two years I thought I moved on but then yesterday I suddenly wandered around instagram and clicked on my exe's sibling's ig (she viewed my story for the first time in a long time so I'm like ooooooh let me see how she's doing) and then there it is, the recent post was a picture of her and my ex and the next photos was my ex with his new girlfriend. I didn't stop there and clicked on the gf's ig and saw all their photos together. HAPPY. FULL OF ADVENTURES. And  I couldn't help but cry with the fact that why am I still sad about it? Am I just doing some self pity party cause I know in myself I'm the one whose supposed to be happy but I'm not? I worked on myself for two years and I hate that I still have relapses. Learned my lesson tho, don't visit ig accounts that I know will just trigger me.   


I can't wait to finally live again, not just survive. I hope y'all are doing alright at least? It's hard. But lets keep holding on eh?
