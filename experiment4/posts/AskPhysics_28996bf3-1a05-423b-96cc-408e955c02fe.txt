"speed of entanglement": why is it impossible?
Ok, I know entanglement needs a local interaction to setup. And I'm also aware that we "cannot exchange data FTL" (no communication theorem).

It feels like this setup should work, but also that it violates FTL communication. I know some of the resolutions for QM is non locality, despite the no communication theorem, and it feels like that's the only thing I'm exploiting here, which is probably wrong...

My understanding of QM is, admittedly not very strong, but I'm looking forward to developing a better intuition for it.

Here is my experimental protocol.

1. Setup a (huge) bunch of entangled pairs of qbits |00&gt;, I don't mean they are always the same, I mean that in a given base of measurement (let's call it "vertical", whatever that means), they always both give 0. But also, since they are entangled and not just (|0&gt; x |0&gt;, unsure x is the proper operator here, but bear with me), any change to one, would impact the other.

The way I see it, this could be achieve by generating triads of 1/✓2|000&gt; + 1/✓2|111&gt;, measure one of the qbits, if it outputs a 1, discard the remaining pair, otherwise, keep it.


2. Split and ship away one qbit from each pair. At some distance so light takes a measurable amount of time to travel from here (A) to there (B).

3. At A, start measuring the qbits, by batches of, say, 100 using the vertical base. And send a light pulse to B. (This is obviously only going to output a bunch of 0 for now).

4. Once B recieves the pulse, reflect it back and measures all the qbits, at once, in a perpendicular base (let's say horizontal).

Now, since the qbits pairs are all |00&gt; in the vertical base, they will be (1/✓2 |00&gt; + 1/✓2 |11&gt;) in horizontal base.
And so, the output at B will all be random 0 and 1s. However, once measured, the remaining qubit of the pair at A will be 50% chance of |0&gt; and 50% chance of |1&gt; in the horizontal base.

This isn't a superposition anymore, only a statistical mix. Each being equivalent to (1/✓2 |00&gt; + 1/✓2 |11&gt;) in the original vertical base. There might be a sign change or a missing i factor to make everything work out, but I don't think it changes the rest of my argument.

5. Reducing that state, the remaining qbit at A now have only 50% chance of being measured as 0 in the vertical base.

Since they are measured by batches of 100, the probability of all of them outputing 0 until the return light speed signal arrives at A is quite low. And could be made arbitrarily low by using bigger batches. We should be able to find an upper limit on entanglement speed.

It feels like that would allow us to setup a FTL clock (and therefore carrier wave, are therefore FTL data exchange, which should be impossible.

This can't be a new idea either and I see two places where my reasoning could fail:

1. My understanding of entanglement is broken at step 1, there are no fundamental differences between |0&gt; x |0&gt; and |00&gt;. (I need to read up on the mathematical framework).

2. My understanding of entanglement is broken at step 4 and measuring one of the qbit in an alternative base doesn't impact the original one. Although, from what I understand of quantum teleportation, that's actually the crux of it...

So where did I get it wrong? Or do we actually have some sort of interesting experiment here?
