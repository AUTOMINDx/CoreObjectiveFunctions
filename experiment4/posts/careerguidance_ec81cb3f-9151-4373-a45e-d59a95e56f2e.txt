I have a worthless degree and I live with my parents. What should I do?
I’ll make it quick. I’m 25. Graduated college with a crappy journalism nearly 4 years ago. Done nothing with my life. Still live with parents. Work a full time job that has nothing to do with my field.  Haven’t done anything in my field in years. Did a shit ton of internships. None of them mattered. Severe depression of 6 years. 

My physical health is failing (not  in weight gain but other issues, not deadly but not where I can hardcore labor like when I was 19) and I don’t have passion for really anything useful. Basically all I enjoy is gaming, news and politics. 

So if I’m going to be miserable I Atleast rather do it in my own place. I don’t want to be 26 still living with my parents.
