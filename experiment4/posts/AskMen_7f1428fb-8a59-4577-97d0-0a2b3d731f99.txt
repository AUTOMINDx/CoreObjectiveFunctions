Men, what’s something you feel that men experience that you feel like society dismisses or downplays?
For me, it’s body issues. I’ve always felt anxious being out in public because there’s a part of me that feels like everyone is looking at me and judging me. I’ll take my dog for his walk and get anxious whenever someone in a car drives by because I feel like they’re looking at me and judging me for my weight and over all appearance. 

I remember about a month ago Jonah Hill made a post on instagram asking everyone to basically back off on the comments on his body, and on Twitter there were a bunch of women making it all about them and their body issues and how it hurts women more and one woman actually referred to Jonah’s situation as an ‘anomaly’. My blood was just about boiling. Yes it’s true that body issues/shaming has historically hurt women more than men but this is hardly an ‘anomaly’…
