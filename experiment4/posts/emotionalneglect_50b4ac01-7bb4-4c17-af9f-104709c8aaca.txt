DAE always feel separate from everything and everyone?
I realized today I never really felt like a belong anywhere. I never felt like I was part of my family, my school, any social circle I was part of (willingly or not) even when I am friends with someone I feel disconnected and distant. I\`ve never been able to get any close loving relationship. I was never anyone’s first choice or most important person. It\`s always just me. And it’s hard, because it makes me feel like I don’t really exist at all or that my existence is irrelevant.   

Is it possible to have a relational trauma so deep that it makes it impossible for you to ever to connect with anyone?
