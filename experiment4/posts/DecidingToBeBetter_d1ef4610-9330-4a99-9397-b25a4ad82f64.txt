I want to be someone's favorite person
Long story short, saw one of my friends say to another that they were their favorite person, and it made me realize I'm no one favorite. I hate that it triggered a strong reaction from me. I hate that I feel jealousy. No one really thinks of me unless I show myself. I feel like have to constantly be around them in order to be remembered, or they'll forget. I feel like I have to be entertaining and provide something to the relationship or else I'm useless. And even doing all of that, I'm not enough. 

I know it's all an exaggeration. I'm completely aware that it's my brain playing tricks on me. I'm sure people miss me and care for me. But these thoughts still plague my fucking mind every once in a while and I just wanted it to stop. I want to be okay with not being relevant in peoples lives. I want to feel like I have worth. 

I know it's probably hard, and it's an ongoing process, but what can I do to change? I feel like I'm suffocating in my own mind.

I just want some help. Something.
