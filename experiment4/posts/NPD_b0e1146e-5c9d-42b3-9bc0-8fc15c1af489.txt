Managing revenge desires
Little backstory before. I broke up with my partner a little more than a month ago, got into a fight being drunk (both of us) because of she still having contact with a man that allegedly, had sexually assaulted  her. Since the breakup, I rarely felt any remorse or sadness, even less had feelings of missing her. This changed last week, when I found out that she had a fwb and was sleeping with him. I know it’s stupid because I have been doing the same shit since then, but my ego got really messed up after this. My first thought was of revenge, and this has brought to me an extreme rage about everything in my life. I don’t want to have anything else to do with her, and also, I don’t want to look like a jerk for messing up with her again. How do you manage this rage and these kind of revenge desires?
