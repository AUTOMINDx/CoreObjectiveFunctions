not sure love is out there for me?
i'm at a point in my life where all my friends are in relationships. almost every one of them is in a relationship or situationship or just seeing someone except for me. even my younger sister (17) just got into her first relationship. i'm 21, have never been in a relationship, and am super inexperienced when it comes to stuff with guys. my time in college is also coming to a close and no one at school has shown interest yet. i really want to be in a relationship, and eventually be married and have kids, but just feel like love isn't out there for me. i've given dating apps a solid try, but don't enjoy them. i'm not sure what to do anymore &amp; feel super alone in this.
