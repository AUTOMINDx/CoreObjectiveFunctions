They will never ever apologize or give empathy to you for the horrible things they’ve done to you but they will beg for your empathy whenever they feel like playing the victim and they try to show you like the monster.
It’s all in the title. They will try to trick you into thinking they’re always the victim of your actions, that they didn’t deserve things you’ve supposedly done to them. But they will NEVER take any responsibility for their truly hurtful actions and again will play the victim when faced about their wrongdoings. For them empathy is a one way trip. In their twisted sense of reality they deserve it all the way, you do not.
