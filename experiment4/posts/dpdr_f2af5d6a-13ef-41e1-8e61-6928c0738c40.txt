Some days hurt more than others...
Who else had an awesome live before they got this? Most of the time I just sit around in disbelief that this is my "life" now if you could even call it that. Looking at pictures from when I didn't have this and didn't even know much horror existed. Life used to fun now it feels like being trapped in hell with the only things I ever feel are terror and fear and anxiety. The pain of knowing I'm missing  out on my life and having absolutely no control or way to make it stop hurts reallllll bad......

just venting I guess.
