I [23F] had breast reduction surgery in July. What's happening to me now? Am I botched?

UPDATE AT BOTTOM

The surgeon removed about 360g from the right side and 220 from the left with a lolipop/under breast incision. Immediately after I woke up, the surgeon told me my breasts were more uneven than she thought initially and my right breast was still going to be bigger. My scars are very uneven. One is much higher and longer than the other.

Additionally, my body is rejecting the dissolving sutures and stitches have been "spitting" for the last few months, one every few weeks. The problem is it leaves a big gaping wound and freaks me out. Is this normal? Am I still supposed to be experiencing stitches spitting 5+ months after surgery? Will they keep spitting forever? The open wounds drain frequently but Urgent Care has said they aren't infected. The surgeon's office is difficult to get a hold of for these concerns.

The uneven-ness of my scars, plus extra large scars from spitting stitch holes, plus the fact that one breast is still bigger than the other makes me feel equally as insecure as I was before the surgery. The only difference is that now I have no feeling anywhere in the areas that were cut or my nipples.

Am I botched? Are the scars fixable? Do I need to get this revised? I have my last followup tomorrow and I need some guidance for what to say to the surgeon when expressing my concerns. Thank you for any and all advice!

Update: it's MRSA. these "spitting stitches" are not that, they are MRSA pustules. The nurses and urgent care doctor were wrong. I am now in decolonization/decontamination. Surgeon was shocked at lack of care her office showed me and appalled I wasn't able to see her despite my repeated efforts. Now I feel like not only a botched freak, but a contagious one. Hopefully if I follow all the steps, this issue will be taken care of. Thanks everyone.
