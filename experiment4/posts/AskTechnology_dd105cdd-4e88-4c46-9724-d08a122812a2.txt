file transfer visualization on PC
So. I do a lot of data transferring. A lot of photos and video clips for TV and film post production.

When i first started in film I used apple products. I have switched to PC since but I have never found a better system for monitoring transfers. The Mac finder window set up with the folder structure in cells and being able to add color labels was the only feature I miss from my apple days. Is there anything similar in the PC world? I'd love to hear from my fellow data wranglers 

Any suggestions welcome:)
