My daughter broke a Mason Jat today....
No one screamed at her. No one called her "stupid" or "clumsy". No one smacked her. 

I  just gave her a hug and reassured her that I wasn't mad and I was just worried about her not getting cut.

I told her it was an accident and that accidents happen. She did get a little cut on her foot, so I placed a bandage on it and kissed it. 

I cleaned up the glass and there was no drama over it. No huffing and puffing. Just calmness and the sound of a Dyson vacuum cleaner. 

I love breaking the cycle.
