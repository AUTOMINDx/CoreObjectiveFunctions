Which women do you admire, respect and look up to as role models?
I've previously heard the complaint that women tend to have male and female role models, while men's role models tend to be almost exclusively male. 

As a man, which women do you admire, respect and look up to, and why? (in the role model sense)

Please do NOT list women that you admire sexually or for their attractiveness. I am also not asking you to list who you think other women should be more like. 
This is NOT about who you want to bang, this is about who has qualities that you would personally like to mirror in yourself.
