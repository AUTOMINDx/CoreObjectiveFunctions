Just wanted to say. I think you all are some of the strongest people on the planet, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time.
Every day that I wake up, and sometimes in my sleep, I deal with being a "survivor." Sometimes I wake up screaming, paralyzed with fear. I'll go to work and be having an alright day, and then some tiny thing sets me off and my whole day is ruined. 

I tried to kill myself twice in 2020. I honestly don't know how I'm still alive. I'm doing much better than I was back then, and I'm starting to shed the whole "survivor" thing and just live a normal life.

Every day that I wake up, I know I deserve to be happy. Because I've been through literal hell and stuck around to visit the giftshop. Every day that you wake up, just give yourself credit for what you deal with every day.

Every day that you open your eyes is a victory.
