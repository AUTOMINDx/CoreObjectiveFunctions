How do I stop using internet and phone addiction to cope with depression?
Hi! I’d really be grateful for any motivation and tips on this. :) Have you ever used your phone or the internet (binge watching shows, social media, reading stuff online) to cope with your emotional pain and numbness? Particularly if the environment you are in is overwhelming and not stimulating in a healthy way? I have these things I want to do, like cultivate a reading habit, shower once a day, do yoga once a day, organise a few belongings, and clean/repair a few things to start with. But I just find myself waking up, feeling extremely depressed and turning to my phone to stimulate my brain and disappearing down the internet to avoid dealing with the boredom, pain (lots of old trauma coming up cause I’m in my hometown and with my parents currently where a lot of stuff has passed and I just dissociate with my surroundings), nothingness. An entire day passes like this and I end up even getting to sleep late. I want to stop using my phone so much, and really sit through the environment I am in, including facing my pain and grieving if I have to.
