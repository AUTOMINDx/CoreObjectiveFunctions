[NY] New job asking me to resign from current employer without background check clearance
I have less than 2 weeks left before my start date with my new employer and my background check has not been completed. Its been under process for 2 weeks+ now and my new workplace is asking me to resign and not wait for the background check to be completed to put in my 2 weeks notice so I can start on time with them.

Is this normal? How can I work around this because I have heard of background checks failing for the most weirdest of reasons and I don't want to put myself in a risky situation where I put in my notice with my current employer and next week my background check fails.

Thanks
