I get the urge to tell people I’m have NPD
I don’t know why, I love to over share but still not over share, you know?

I just want people close to me to fucking understand that it’s exhausting for me to act like I care that they got a new job, it’s exhausting to answer their damn questions all the time just shut the fuck up and support me and my life, give me validation and make me feel wanted!!

I’ve never vented so much in my life, I feel so good now

But I’m just gonna say I have depression because apparently NPD is for evil people
