Hey all! My doctors can’t figure out what’s wrong with my GI system, and I don’t blame them… but maybe a physician here will have some insight.
Thank you in advance for reading, and apologies in advance for poopoo talk.

I’ve been struggling with abdominal pain coupled with general IBS/GI distress for the past three years. This seems to have been triggered by a Hep A infection and/or gonorrhea (even though I’m vaccinated) given to me by a cheating ex-partner. I’ve been treated for both, of course, and have since not had any subsequent infections, STIs, or the like. One odd thing that sticks out to me: when I was initially hospitalized, I recall being told by a nurse that she could see calcifications in my small intestine which she said was strange for my age, but the doctor never mentioned that so I didn’t pay it too much mind, but I wonder if that could point to something else going on. 
Edit: I want to mention I also have pretty extreme midday fatigue lately and have been napping, which is very unlike me. 
In the past two months, my symptoms have gotten to the point that upon eating anything, I am uncomfortably full (bloated- feels as though it is in my small intestine), feel as though my stomach is “sour” constantly, and am constipated/have diarrhea constantly unless I use Metamucil. I have a colonoscopy scheduled, but I feel like an endoscopy might be a good idea too- disagreeing with my new GI.

Any insight?
Thanks again.
