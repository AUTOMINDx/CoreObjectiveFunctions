Seeking advice on what to do about a man in a professional setting consistently misgendering a femme, cis woman
I have a middle aged male client who, from day 1, CONSISTENTLY addresses me as “sir” in every email. I have had video calls with this man, I have a very common female name, and a female sounding voice. After I started including my pronouns in all my correspondence with him, he referred to me as “he” in a conference call with other clients. I work in a male dominated industry and in a traditionally male role and I feel like this weird behavior is his way of saying to me “a man should have your job.” My (female) boss thinks that my client is just referring to me as male out of habit/confusion and I am being overly sensitive. I am struggling to work with this client without getting angry but my boss is uncomfortable with me confronting him directly about this and also very hesitant to transfer him to one of my coworkers.

*edit* my boss is afraid if I confront the client, he will complain to the director and make her and our department look bad. She doesn’t want to transfer him to one of my coworkers because she thinks I am being over sensitive and it would be annoying for a coworker to take over midway.
