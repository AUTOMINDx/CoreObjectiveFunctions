If only I had had suicide pills, I would have just ended it.
I am writing this post in desperate need of assurance that everything will be fine. I have no one to talk to about my mental state. I don't know why, but deep down I wanted to be told that things would get better somehow, even if it's for false hope. Please help me.

I am done with this meaningless life. I tried to make my mind wander away from all the painful day-to-day life, but in the end, everything just got worse, everyone just made it hellish and I was the only one suffering from it, yet no one even bothered to help.
