I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life alone
I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm keeping myself as busy as I can during the holidays, exercising, helping around the house with some small chores, I'm making the effort. But even then I feel like I'm lying to myself. I feel like I'll never find love, no matter what I do or how I do it. I try to be as genuine as possible, I'm nice, I'm respectful, I'm just afraid. I'm afraid of telling girls I like about how I feel, because at this point I'm used to it ending in disaster. I don't know what else to do, or how to do it. I'm trying my best to be happy, yet judging by this post it's clear that I'm not. I can never appreciate what's around me either, despite having EVERYTHING I need to feel appreciative. I don't know anymore. At this point, asking complete strangers on the internet for life advice feels like the only option.
