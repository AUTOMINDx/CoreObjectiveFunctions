My dad forced my sister to eat until she threw up
This is my first post so sorry if it’s a little  rough. A couple weeks ago we were on a family trip and for dinner we were having a meal with chicken, we didn’t have a way to heat it up so the food was cold. My little sister (11) hates eating meat (especially cold) and ate everything else but refused to touch the chicken. My dad told her she had to eat  or she couldn’t have desert and she saidshe didn’t care and kept saying she wouldn’t eat it. My dad told her she had to eat it anyway even if she didn’t want desert. Basically this went on for a long time with my sister crying and my dad sitting there yelling at her until she finished the entire meal. We were in a small camper trailer so there wasn’t really anywhere to get away from it. As soon  as she ate the last bite she threw it all back up on the plate. My dad got upset with her and said he might make her eat what she threw up again. I don’t think he meant it but she started freaking out. My mom stepped in at this point and told him to let it go and let my sister leave the table. Later we were having desert and my dad wouldn’t let her have any because he said she worked herself up like that on purpose. 
I keep thinking about it feel bad we all ate desert without her and how upset she was through the whole thing. She is really picky though and sometimes it does seem like she has issues eating food in general. So I guess I wonder, was it bad for my dad to make her eat the food she hates or is this just something she needs to learn?
