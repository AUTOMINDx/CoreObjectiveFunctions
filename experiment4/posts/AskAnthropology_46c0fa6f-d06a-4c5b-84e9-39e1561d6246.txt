How was giving birth during Jesus era?
Years ago, I watched a documentary that tried to show a more scientific point-view of how Mary delivered Jesus and all the history behind.

I remember they explained that during that time, women used to hold a rope attached to the ceiling and then squat, but I cannot find any reliable i formation that tells us that was like that in that region during that time.

Is there any paper or book that explain that or there was a different way?

Thanks!
