Thought about suicide last night
I have had acid every day for the past 4 months. I have to wait another month to get into the GI. But, last night I didn’t get to eat lunch or dinner so I decided to have plain popcorn , maybe 3 hours before bed. WwwoooAaaaaa. Never again. I had 4 TABLESPOONS of gaviscon and it didn’t even help.I might have fell asleep around 1am and woke up again and took a chug of it again. I know I went well beyond recommended usage but that’s how bad it was. 

I never had issues until I tried this “death nut” challenge with a friend. It’s these really hot nuts and it’s a serious or pack of them. I ended up finishing the “challenge” but throwing up. My stomach hurt all that day and into the next but since then I have had GERD

Anyone else have experience like this.. after eating something super hot?
