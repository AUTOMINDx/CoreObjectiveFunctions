I turned 18 a week ago and made no effort in becoming 18 years old mentally
I still have a same, rotten mind. How do I change it around? What do I do to completely change my thoughts and the way I think completely? I hate the way I think and I hate my thoughts but I never hate them unless I reflect on them like I am doing right now. I feel like a horrible person with no sense of personal authority or sincerity. 

I feel that everything I produce in my mind is either a heavy negative, neutral, or constructed by media or people that my mind threads together, I have no opinion or mind. 

I feel brainless and I want to fix that, I know I have a brain but I don’t feel like it’s really thinking and if it is, it’s all completely and terribly wrong. I react too much, I’m instinctive, I have no control.

I want to become 20 with pride and not fear, because all I feel is fear in a lot of things, or reactionary emotions. How do I progress my mind so that I can progress reality because I feel with this mind I can not progress in the real world

I’m very scared and have accomplished nothing in my life
