What are your favorite placements and why?
Mine are my main three Aries Sun, Scorpio moon, Sag rising ðŸ”¥ then my Venus &amp; Mercury both in Pisces, I like all of these placements because it makes me feel like lava. I am fire and liquid. I am an ocean on fire. Or how light shines through waters and creates rainbows ! All of these placements are what also makes me feel very connected to the spiritual and metaphysical realm. I donâ€™t have much earth so feeling grounded is hard as Iâ€™m pure emotion and passion
