How do you continue to live knowing you'll die? (PTSD Anxiety)
I'm afraid to ask my therapist this because I don't want to be hospitalized - I don't want to hurt myself or kill myself. I know it might be taken that way, but I couldn't. 

I lost my dad 6 years ago. My mom recently passed away a few months ago. I am attending college this semester because she wanted me to keep going, and so do my immediate family. I work 3 jobs currently, its about maybe 25-30 hours a week depending on which job I work more. 

I stopped taking my meds after thanksgiving (my first one without my mom). I would spend evenings leading up to it trying to be present with my people and I'd just get these overwhelming, intrusive thoughts of "You're going to die. You will die and this will all be nothing anymore. Time will continue to pass and you can't stop it." It takes the breath out of me when I'm alone and I go into a panic attack. I try to ignore it when I'm in public and act casual, but even then I end up spacing out a lot. 

I honestly can't be sure it's the medication (lexapro 20mg, been on it for 3 months after prozac was making me more depressed) but since not taking it I haven't had those thoughts. Instead, I've been overwhelmingly panicky and crying. I can't control it and I don't want to leave my room, I feel like I'd start sobbing in public over nothing. 

Maybe this is the first time I'm not on meds that I'm processing how alone I feel, and it just really is an overwhelming thing I never took time since my mom's passing to think about. I don't know what I'm asking here, I guess just what I could do to try and function daily. I feel like I haven't been for a while. 

Thank you all.
