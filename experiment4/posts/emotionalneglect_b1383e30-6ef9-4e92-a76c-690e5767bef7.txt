I feel a vague, internal barrier with everyone I'm close to and it's been a challenge trying to overcome it.
I've been in survival mode and it's been hard to feel things that when I actually do I cling on to it or I feel fake for feeling. Conversations with my girlfriend and with my closest friend feel superficial, emotionless, shortlived sometimes. They're not but they feel that way to me because I feel distant. 

It pisses me off how nice my girlfriend and I are to each other that it starts to feel like we're both interacting with each others' facades. Even though we're very close and we feel close I can't help feeling this way sometimes. Maybe I'm not handling healing and being in a healthier relationship well.

I want to ve vulnerable, to do the things that will bring us closer more often, but this doesn't seem to happen. Maybe I'm being a perfectionist about it. It's just... Hard to feel things.
