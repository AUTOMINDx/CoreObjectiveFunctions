Is there anyway to download an audio file from an audio player on a webpage?
Firstly apologies if this is not the correct place to ask this question.

Hello,  I would like to download some drum-loops from a webpage that allows me  to listen to them through an audio player that's embedded on the  webpage.

I've tried combing through the page's source code and source files but I wasn't able to find anything.

Is there anyway to accomplish my goal?
