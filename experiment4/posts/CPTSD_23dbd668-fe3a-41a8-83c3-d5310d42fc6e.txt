DAE feel incredibly ashamed when around other ppl?
I don't even mean about anything in particular, just in general. Like you are the imposter, you don't deserve to be there, and everyone probably secretly knows it and is just waiting for you to step a toe out of line to strike and start treating you like trash. Or like you're genuinely disgusted with yourself, like every breath you take, way you move, and word you speak is viscerally Wrong and you're not even human, just this bizarre inferior thing failing to impersonate one. Or just me?
