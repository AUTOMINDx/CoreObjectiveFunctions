Is being sexually molested as a child a normal thing ?
Is being sexually molested as a child by a close family member something "normal" that happens to alot of us ?

Like do families really do this and just keep it hidden under the rug to avoid having the family separated or whatever...?

I'm genuinely asking , this happened to me and someone else in the family and when it was brought up to my parents we both were shut down and attacked pretty much questions like "why are you telling me now why didnt you tell me before "
"Well then you let it happen"

Please answer with sincerity I take what people say too serious sometimes ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

EDIT: 12/13/21 2pm central time- 

1st trauma- 7ish years old (X person about 13ish) 
2nd trauma- 10/11ish (X person about 16/17ish)
3rd and last trauma- 13ish (X person about 19/20ish) (about 2-3 years later around 16yrs old I made the decision to leave my parents house because of X person)
I'm sure it happened more but I dont remember and idk if its recommended or not but I dont think i want to know honestly.
 

Also when I posted last night , I really thought that this was something normal , I really did think at a moment that maybe it was my fault that maybe I was being dramatic and i let it happen and everything else that was being said to me.


Thanks so much to everyone sharing your stories and your outcomes , reading everything is making me feel less alone and a little more normal. I'm grieving right now the loss of my family and it hurts a lot, this is without a doubt the hardest pain I have ever experienced in my life, it hurts me literally to my heart. 

But I do have my 1st appointment with a therapist next week. And also I have my physiciatrist whom I talk to every month.

Thank you for all your support I took the time to look into support groups and have found a few around me I will definently do that as well. Idk yall are really making me feel warm inside , thank you !!! I cant say thanks enough!!! Thank you!!
