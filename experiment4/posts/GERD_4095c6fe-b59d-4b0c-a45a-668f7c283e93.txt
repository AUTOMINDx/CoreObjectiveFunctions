Endoscopy and Colonoscopy came back completely fine. Scared and so confused about what to do next.
This is what the doctor sent it an email. 
“I really think that you have a musculoskeletal etiology to your pain and there is no clear testing to prove this. We have done a lot of testing to exclude big and bad things in the gi tract. I don’t think you need any additional testing from a GI standpoint.” 

So confused about what that means. I’ve had ongoing consistent horrible pain from my stomach for 5 years now. No matter what I eat or what I do it’s a consistent pain and now I get this message. Any ideas on how to heal a musculoskeletal etiology or what it even is? Thanks for all the help guys
