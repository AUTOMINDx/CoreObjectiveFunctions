a lot harder to make friends as a woman
jealous of guys who can strike up a friendship with another guy just bc they like the same sports or video games. a lot of women need to make sure their friends are beneficial to their image/not pretty enough to be threatening  to them. then, they have to be matching at all times to look good for the gram. can’t forget making a separate group chat without the friend they like least (usually me). girl friend groups seem to operate in a hive mind and i hate it. and it’s not like i can have a group of guy friends bc the overwhelming majority of men can only tolerate being around a women when they’re actively trying to sleep with them
