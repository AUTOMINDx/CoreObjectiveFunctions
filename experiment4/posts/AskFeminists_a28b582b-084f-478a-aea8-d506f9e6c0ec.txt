What do you think of the lack of response to the harassment of Brie Larson?
So, what I'm asking is, how do you feel knowing that Brie Larson got harassed with nothing done about it, while Chris Pratt was able to get nothing but defense for the church he goes to?

I ask this because I like Brie Larson and I think it's terrible that she got harassed by misogynistic men online.

Meanwhile, Chris Pratt attends a queerphobic church and he gets nothing but defense from Marvel cast members.
