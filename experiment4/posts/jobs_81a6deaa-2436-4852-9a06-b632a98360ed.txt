Not a valid excuse to miss work.
So i currently work at a pizza place part time. i just had a family emergency where my uncle is in the hospital and my family and i are 30 min away from home. i am currently stuck babysitting my cousins for the rest of the day. I am scheduled to work at 4:30 and i texted my manager to let her know the situation. she said unfortunately it is not a valid excuse and will need to make it to work. I’m literally unable to go, what would happen if i don’t show up?
