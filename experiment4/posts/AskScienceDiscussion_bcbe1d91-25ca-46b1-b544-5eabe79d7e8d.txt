If you were in a room with no windows and went seamlessly from floating in zero gravity to free falling, at the same speed as the room, would you be able to tell a difference?
So like outer space vs. free falling through an atmosphere within the room, with you falling at the same exact speed as the room is falling. 

Without any sort of visual or audio cues, can the body detect the difference between actual zero-gravity and the simulated zero gravity that you might experience in one of those planes that fly straight down so you can float around in the cabin?
