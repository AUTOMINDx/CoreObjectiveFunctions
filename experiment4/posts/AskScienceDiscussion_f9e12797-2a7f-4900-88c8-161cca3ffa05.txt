How do space telescopes help advance society?
Today, the James Webb telescope launched. Interesting stuff! I'm very hyped, but I had a discussion today what the telescope is worth for society as a whole? I'm not asking about the advantage vs normal telescopes, I know how space telescopes are better, but what are they needed for? I looked into the advances the Hubble telescope helped with, but I can't see how they are useful beyond the pure advancement of astronomy. Did the Hubble telescope help discover anything that resulted in anything applicable beyond "now we know more about the universe"? Is there anything to be expected from the Webb telescope?

Imagine I have to explain my parents why they should be excited about the telescope\^^
