How do senior engineers know so much? What do I have to do to get to that point?
I interned for a year, and have been working full-time for about half a year as a controls system engineer. I know I've learned so much during my time so far, and I started part-time grade school so I can try to learn more to keep up with advanced stuff that we're doing at my work.

It's just hard to see myself knowing as much as a senior engineer, most I work with are a lot more efficient than I am, better at documentation, and just knows so much. How do you get to this point? Is this just continuous learning in and out of work? It gets hard to keep up sometimes with everything I am trying to learn. 

I tell myself they have 20-30+years of more experience, but it seems impossible for me to know as much.

At what point did you feel comfortable with how much you know (and if you had it, no longer have imposter syndrome) And do you continuously try to learn in and out of work? Just for reference I work for a small-medium sized robotics company in Ca.

Thanks!
