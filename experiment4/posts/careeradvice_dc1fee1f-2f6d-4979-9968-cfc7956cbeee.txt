Am I being gaslit?
I just had my performance evaluation and I am left shocked to say the least. I have been working for quite some time now for this company in a role where I am severely overworked, underpaid and undervalued. Nothing I ever do seems to be “good enough” for the management. When I do take initiative and try to come up with ideas I am knocked down a couple pegs but when I just “fall in line” and do what needs to be done, I was told that I needed to take initiave. My bosses said some really ridiculous and unfair things to me and continuously discredited any achievement I brought up. The review was also focused on what I needed to do better and did not focus at all on what I mastered or already did well. I am full of dread and anxiety every single day, I am buried with minimal clerical tasks yet I am told to interact more with people and hop in on conversations. They said I was too slow in completing tasks but when I communicate how much I have to do they told me I was expressing “frustration”. To summarize I have no clue how to move forward and they have completely destroyed any self confidence I had due to constant gaslighting and criticism. They turned all my strengths into weaknesses: I always ask if anyone needs help, and they said I should have enough to do and should come up with tasks myself, I always communicate if I am really busy but they said I was expressing frustration. Any advice would help.
