My manager is threatening to call corporate on me because I had food poisoning. What should I do?
I work at a warehouse/supermarket (3 &amp; Â½ years) and over the weekend I bought a little thing of curry and ended up getting food poisoning from it. On the same day my coworker also happened to get food poisoning and we both had to call out, I got back to work earlier today and come to find out that my manager was/is threatening to call corporate because of the incident saying we called out on purpose. What would you do in this situation?

Not sure if this matters but I did have sick time to cover the shift.

Edit: Jesus was not expecting this much traffic, to clarify some stuff, they don't know we know I was just told last night via text from the same coworker who also called out, my other coworker/friend heard it from another manager because someone started a ridiculous rumor over it.
