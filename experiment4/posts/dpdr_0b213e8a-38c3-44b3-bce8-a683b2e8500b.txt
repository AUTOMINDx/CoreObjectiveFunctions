Everyone here can recover
Dpdr is a temporary measure. For everyone. It’s just your bodies response trying to protect u from “a threat” or “danger” that isn’t there. It’s a trauma response that for me was a result of very bad weed induced panic attacks that traumatized me. It depends on the person obviously for how long it is going to take to recover, but no matter how long or how severe your dpdr may be it is literally a temporary measure that 100% of people are capable of recovering from. I’ve been slowly but surely improving and the first step for me was accepting your symptoms. Understand no matter how scary and uncomfortable they may feel, they are not dangerous and cannot hurt you. After you accept the feelings are there the next thing you have to do is stop resisting them. That’s been the hardest part for me. When you resist your symptoms both physical and mental it’s putting more stress on you  and the loop will just continue. Obsessing and worrying about ur symptoms leads you to further anxiety and prolongs your recovery. So accept that they are there and stop resisting them, eventually your body will realize that there is no danger and threat and it the symptoms will naturally fade.
