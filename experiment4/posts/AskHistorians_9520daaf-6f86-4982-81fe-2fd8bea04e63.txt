I read that the Mongols were mass producing texts in the 13th century using a moveable block type printing method. Why was Gutenberg's press so revolutionary in the 15th century if similar technology already existed in the interconnected Eastern hemisphere?
Title basically says it all, came across this reading "Genghis Kahn" and it made me scratch my head. I was always taught Gutenberg took Europe from labor intensive manual transcription to modular type. But it appears similar technologies already existed at least among the huge and widely influential Mongol Empire. Was there printing in Europe before Gutenberg? If so what was it like? If not... Why not?
