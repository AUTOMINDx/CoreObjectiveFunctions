I've tried to develop so many passions that I'm just lost now
Hi--this may be long but I'll try to sum this up easily. 

I'm on my last leg of college, and for as long as I can remember I've been a very ambitious person. I have a lot of big dreams but none of them have been executed because my mind wanders and I find something else to have a short passionate burst for. 

For instance, one of my dreams is to be Youtuber because ever since I was young I loved video-editing and telling stories. I pursued this for a bit but then stumbled across this video about dropshipping and got into that. I started wanting to become an Entrepreneur because building brands is fun to me but the capital investment to reap high rewards has been difficult for me to get by. The same thing happened with NFTs - I loved the creative aspect of NFTs and wanted to launch my own but those gas fees are insane.

My head is a whirlwind: I want to do so many things and I cycle through these different things that I want to do but never settle on one. I've tried to do both at once and got incredibly burnt out really quickly. I want to go all in on one but I have so many fears about whether or not I'll be successful and wasting my time on one when I could have done better in one of my other dreams. 

What do you all suggest that I do?
