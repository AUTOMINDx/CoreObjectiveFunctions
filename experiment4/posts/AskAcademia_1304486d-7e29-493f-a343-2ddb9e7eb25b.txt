Workflow for organizing notes on papers / research?
Hey all!

As the new year rolls around I'm making it a point to start reading more papers once again. One problem I've faced in the past is finding a good workflow for collecting my ideas and notes. I always end up with a jumbled mess of disconnected ideas for things that really should be connected. Things I've tried in the past include:

- pen and paper, then adding notes as PDF pages to the PDF version

- boox tablet where I write in my notes directly to the PDF. The issue here is that all those notes are pretty disjoint.

- roam research, but I ended up using it as a bullet point taking tool. It was useful to be able to use backlinks, but it was pretty expensive, and the cloud-only setting was a huge thorn in my side.

Ideally the workflow would be something like the following:

- notes directly onto the PDF
- easy export of the notes + relevant sections
- a way to backlink everything to easily jump around between ideas.

P.s I work in a computational area, so math equations and such are a nice-to-have for me.

Alternative tools include:
- obsidian note taking
- logseq (roam research-like tool with less features, but allows local storage)

for those interested in note taking tools.
