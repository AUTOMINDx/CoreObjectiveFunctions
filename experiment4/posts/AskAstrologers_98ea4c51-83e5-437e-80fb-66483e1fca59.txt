Anyone else with a Sagittarius moon feel incredibly wiped this morning after the eclipse last night?
I slept in for hours this morning, which I normally never do. I feel remarkably “clear” but it’s as if I was in some intense battle over night in my dreams. 

On top of that, my 10th house is also ruled by Sagittarius because I have a Pisces rising and my north node / MC is also in Sag. Everything feels brought out into the center stage. I’ve definitely been thinking a lot about my career, public image (of course, I’m a Leo!) and what is the best approach to how I’m expressing what I stand for. A lot of deep thinking, introspection and movement inside of me. I’m always roaming and out and about but this time I feel that energy directed inwards in an intense way, searching for what I really want without distractions or preoccupations on all my “options”. Frankly I’m tired of all these options and want to only focus on what serves me. 

I also deactivated all my social media and have become very protective of my energy and who I spend time with. I only trust books and my boyfriend right now, haha. My bf is a cancer moon and he just seems fine and dandy and I’m like dude I’m on a different planet rn! 

Anyone else? How has the eclipse affected you?
