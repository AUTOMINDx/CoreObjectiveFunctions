I'm not sure what I'm doing with my life
I'm almost 27 years old with no college degree and almost no prior work experience. I was a YouTuber and made a living out of it for a few years but the channel doesn't do well anymore and I feel stuck. I dropped out of college because I hated it and this YouTube thing was really taking off at the time so I focused on it full time without really thinking what would happen if my channel doesn't do well. So here I am now, with almost no work experience, no degree or anything. Just trying to figure out what I wanna do.  


On top of all this, I am trying to move to a different country (currently in the US). It's expensive but I have to move there for my gf because she doesn't live in the US and she wouldn't want to move here. (She lives in Australia). So now, it's like even if I did want to go to college, it wouldn't be easy. 

Life just feels like a complete mess and I feel like I've failed miserably at it.
