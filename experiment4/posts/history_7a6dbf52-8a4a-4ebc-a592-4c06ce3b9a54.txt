When did kings stop owning all land in their kingdom?
So I have heard that throughout the medieval period that kings of the land were considered to own all the land in their kingdom and that the peasants were just consider to be allowed on it. Basically that the entire kingdom was the kings personal property. 

So my question is when did this idea change? When did the people who purchased and lived on the section of land considered the owner and not the king?

Or if I am wrong about this please correct me
