Why does Finland have the largest debt relative to GDP out of all Nordic countries?
&amp;#x200B;

Sweden 39,9% of GDP

Denmark 42,2% of GDP

Norway 41,4% of GDP

**Finland 69,2% of GDP**

I excluded Iceland, as its population is only 400 000 people, and comparing economics would not be really fair.
