Nephew hitting my son
My husband’s brother’s son is 2.5 years old and my son is 3, about a 7 month difference. My nephew, let’s call him J is constantly hitting my son, pinching him, throwing toys at him and stealing toys away. All my sister in law does is say “no” in the nicest way possible or “let’s not do that”. Immediately after, he does the same thing again. No times outs, no actual consequences, nothing. We see them pretty frequently because we live close by and our family gets together pretty often. My mother in law doesn’t see this as a problem and says “he’s just frustrated”. My mother in law frequently takes sides with her kids but that’s another story. Anyways, I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to be the one disciplining someone’s kid but I am not okay with my son constantly being bullied. Also, just want to say that I’m not blaming my nephew at all. But I don’t think it’s okay that he continues doing this and his parents keep allowing this behavior. What should I do?
