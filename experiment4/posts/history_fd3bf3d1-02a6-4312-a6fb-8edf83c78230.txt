Works on the history of drugs
Hi!

I recently finished a book called “Historia General de las Drogas”, from [Antonio Escohotado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Escohotado) (General history of drugs in English).

The author analyses the use of and society view towards drugs from antiquity to the 90’s.

It was really eye opening and totally recommend it. The author has published several books on the topic, some shorter, some denser.

Any other recommendations on the topic of drugs/ethnobotanics? Their history, uses, creation…
