Nfamily looked into my bank account and is forcing me to spend my savings.
What the actual hell. It’s not just one member of my family, but it’s a whole unit. I’m 21 and they force me not to have a job “because college is my job” or I’ll get kicked out of the house if I do get a job. Then they guilt trip me about having to support me. I’m not spending my savings because I need that as an emergency incase it gets really bad. 

So I told my nanna I didn’t have any money left over so that I could keep my savings. Well somehow she LOOKED INTO MY BANK ACCOUNT and saw how much I had- and is not forcing me to use that. I was concerned about the security of my account. It’s not joint with them, and she had no way of accessing that info. When I asked her she said, “I have a high security clearance due to my job” which I know is a load of bs because she doesn’t have high clearance. When I told her that I just need to know out of security reasons she got reallll defensive. This isn’t the first time my privacy has been invaded. I also just learned tonight that they had put a tracking device on my car at some point- but it had gotten ripped off. I didn’t do it because I didn’t know there was one. Then at one point they put cameras in my car with audio in them. (Which is illegal here cause I didn’t consent) 

What the actual hell. What the actual hell is this situation??? Has anyone been in this situation? How did you get out. 

So they invaded my privacy in multiple ways at the age of 21- then when I say that all I want is privacy I get guilt tripped, yelled at, and told how I’m at fault for all of this occurring.
