Did anyone else’s parents threaten to throw them out while growing up?
Growing up, my parents would always threaten to throw me out of the house. Then when I got close to being 18, they would say stuff like, “Only 3 months till your out”, or they would hold throwing me out over my head. Any time I would stand up to them, they’d be like, “Well, we were gonna let you stay, but you don’t treat us right”. It’s all manipulation. They would start 95% of the the fights, and when I stood up for myself or didn’t give into their tactics, then they held this stuff over my head. I find it disgusting how they twist things.
