Why were the Marathas unable to defeat the British for control of India?
It is often said that the British Empire took over India from the Mughal Empire, but in fact, by the time of the early 1700s, the dominant power on the subcontinent was not the Mughals but the Maratha Empire, founded by Shivaji in 1674. The Marathas would grow to rule large portions of India, even reaching a point where they sieged Delhi and marched into the Mughal capital in 1757, decades before the British became a significant threat.

Yet, after three Anglo-Maratha Wars, the smaller British forces were able to emerge victorious. Why were the Marathas unable to defeat the forces of the East India Company, given that  
technological differences did not seem to be so big? How were the British able to beat the subcontinent's dominant power?
