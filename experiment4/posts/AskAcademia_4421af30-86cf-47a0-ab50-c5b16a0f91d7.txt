What are the wildest hijinks you never though you’d have to write a syllabus disclaimer about (and yet here we are)?
This morning I woke up to an email from a top journal in my field confirming my submission. I definitely did not submit anything there. Eventually I realized that instead of submitting their term paper to Canvas, one of my students had somehow managed to submit it as a manuscript to a journal, under my name and identity. I can’t believe I have to put “do not submit your class papers as journal manuscripts under my name” in my syllabi. 

I just keep thinking about it and bursting into laughter. So, what are some of your “I can’t believe that just happened” teaching stories? 

This is not a thread for student bashing - just some good natured, end of the semester stress relief!
