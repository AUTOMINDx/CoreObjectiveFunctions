[MA] Does HR get a bonus based on unused portion of budget for benefits?
My buddy and I were arguing about this the other day.  Question is a bit more complex.

Facts: 

His company gives 5% of his salary to his retirement fund.  They also match up to 4% more.

His company offers two health insurance plans.  One is more expensive and provides more/better coverage.

The company's budgets for the year are 'worst case', in the sense that they set aside enough money to cover everyone matching 9% and taking the more expensive health insurance.

His extrapolations:

The company should just give him the 9% without asking for anyone to match, because the money is already set aside in the budget.

Upper management and HR specifically choose the 4% match and the two insurance options in order to create a portion of the budget that they know will have unspent funds at the end of the year.

They do so because their bonuses are a portion of the unspent budget.

My response:

I doubt HR's bonus has anything to do with the budgets.  Possibly they receive some sort of bonus based on the company's overall performance, maybe even specifically if the whole company or department comes in under budget.

I assume the 4% is negotiated as an incentive to keep/attract workers and is only that high because only some will participate.  I assume the two healthcare options really are just for the benefit of the workers, possibly to make the job more attractive.

So, how does this really work?  Is it different depending on what level you are in the company?
