What was ancient wine like, would cheap boxed modern wine seem like very high quality wine if I brought it back in time and served it to people used to expensive wine?
I've read that ancient wine was actually pretty poor quality compared to modern standards. We can today reliably produce millions of litres of a brand of wine a year and the quality and taste is basically the same in every bottle or cask. It's clean, stores well, is perfectly fine to drink. 

How would this cheap wine today compare to the wine from 3,000 or 2,000 years ago, would our cheap wine today impress a roman emperor who was accustomed to the best wine of his day, or would the best ancient wine actually be quite a lot better than cheap commercially produced wine you can buy anywhere today? And when ancient wine is described as overall bad and difficult to handle, being a paste that needs watering down before drinking, and disguising the natural flavour with additives like herbs and honey, did that apply to the very best wine of back then or was it only the cheap wine?
