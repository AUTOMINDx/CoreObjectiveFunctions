How did early Homo Sapiens deal with bodily dirt ? Did they only live near bodies of water ?
Humans can get pretty dirty without doing anything and early Homo Sapiens probably had lots to do, so they probably got real dirty much quicker, and licking themselves like some other animals was probably not an option too because it either was not possible or tolerable.

It seems to me humans are unique in how fast and dirty they can get among the animal kingdom, so I wonder what the answer is.
