People who label others as 'low value'
Has anyone else run across this? I have seen it in a few different areas of reddit and it makes me really sad to be honest. People frequently list those with mental illness, people who may have few friends or people who are unable to work as low value. I think it's really cruel to judge anyone in such a cruel way because nobody knows anyone else's story or their life journey.
I know that if my life had turned out differently, I would love to have a good job and to have met kind and supportive people, but my life hasn't turned out like this so far and it depresses me further that me and probably many others like me are lumped into categories according to Whether we have value or not due to the trauma we incurred in our lives 

The truth is that all human beings have value, someone has value just for being a good person or bringing a smile to someone else's face,  especially in this harsh world we are living in now. 

Does this kind of stuff really get others down aswell?
