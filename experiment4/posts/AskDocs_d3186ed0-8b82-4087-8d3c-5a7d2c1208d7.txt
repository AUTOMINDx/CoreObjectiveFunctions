Need help with these dog bites 17F
Hi guys, 

My girlfriend, who is a 17-year-old female, was bitten by a dog 1.5 weeks ago, she went to the doctor and he gave her an Anti Biotic but it's finished and these still look bad, I'm getting worried they are infected, notice the orangish blood and the yellow?

She is taking some medication like Iron tablets but hasn't the last few days (unprescribed).

Other stats of her include:

17 years old  
Female  
165-170cm  
50kg  
Non-smoker
