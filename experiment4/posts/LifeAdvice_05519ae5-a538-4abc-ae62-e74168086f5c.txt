Don't really know who I am
I have the feeling that over the years I forgot who I really am. Life experiences, mostly the bad ones and aquired negative thoughts about myself, others and the world really slowed me down and left me crippled. I am often depressed and don't really find room to become myself again. Everyone around me irritades me and I can't really show honest appreciation for the little things. I am in a loop of self-worthlessness and pity for myself with phases in between in in which I find strenght for a little time to be my best self, but I feel like putting on a show when doing that. The worst part is, nobody seems to understand that I can't control being a bitch sometimes and I desperately want to feel connected to others and myself again. There are too many emotions and thoughts inside me everyday..

How can I find myself again? How can I let go of the past? Can someone relate to my story?
