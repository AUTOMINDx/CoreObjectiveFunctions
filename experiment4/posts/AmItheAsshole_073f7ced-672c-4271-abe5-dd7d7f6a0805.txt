AITA for not wanting my fiancé’s friend in our wedding party?
My (f26) fiancé (m28) have been together for four years. He’s been friends with “maya” (f30) for six years. They’re fairly close but she doesn’t like me much. It’s usually not an issue, some people just don’t mesh. We don’t mesh. 
Edit to add: there’s no heavy animosity and we can be near each other fine, we just don’t talk when we are. We don’t actively hate each other, just prefer not to hang out together. She isn’t against us getting married and likely would say yes to being a bridesmaid to make him happy but isn’t pushing for it herself 

We’re recently engaged and he’d like her to be a bridesmaid. I don’t. He wants her in a dress matching my bridesmaids, on my side, participating in the things we’re doing. I said absolutely not, she doesn’t even like me. I’ve seen wedding photos where one bridesmaid clearly doesn’t want to be with the bride and I don’t want that. Plus I really only want the women closest to me as bridesmaids. I suggested she wear a black dress to match the men’s tux’s and be a groomsman. He said that will look dumb and he doesn’t want to do that. Because he’s dead set against including her on his side with the men and their activities and I’m dead set against having her with me and my bridesmaids, he’s said I’ve effectively said she can’t be in the wedding. I argued he’s just as much at fault for not budging as I am but he said I’m the one being unreasonable. Mind you his only reason for not wanting her with his groomsmen is “that’s dumb just let her be a bridesmaid.” 

AITA for not budging and basically keeping her out of the wedding party according to my fiancé?
