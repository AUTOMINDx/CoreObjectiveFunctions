How to tell my boss I’m leaving to evaluate my career and explore what I want to do?
After some consideration and way too much time dedicated to taking my asshole boss’s bullshit and abuse, I want to leave my job this year. I could very easily start looking for a new role, but honestly my industry has really started to rub me the wrong way and I don’t see myself being in it for the rest of my career. I want to dedicate my time to figuring out what i really want to do and set myself up for a potential career transition. Also, my boss’s constant abuse has made me extremely demotivated, so much that when i just browse job listings, I’m immediately turned off and don’t feel in the right head space to jump into a job search. I  want to get a new job because I'm genuinely exciter about it, not out of desperation. I also started my own business this past year. It’s nowhere near ready for me to transition over to it full time, but I would love to focus my full time to it as well as figuring out what other job I’d like to do, if any. I am working on understanding my monthly budget and whether I am in a good place financially to take some time off. The thing I am most scared of is telling my boss. He tends to take things personally and I think he’d be mad if I left. What’s the best way to tell him I’m leaving even though I’m not leaving for another job, and how do i stand my ground if he makes a counter offer or tries convincing me to stay?
