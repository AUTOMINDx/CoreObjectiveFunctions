I hate people with happy families, I hate them so much.
They’ll never know what it’s like, they’ll never understand how painful it is to have 18 years of your life by ruined by people who were meant to protect you.
The worlds made for them, they get to be healthy and happy and enjoy every holiday they had.
They don’t have to fight at Christmas or debate going to birthday parties because you just know people will get drunk.
They’ll never get it, no matter how much they try.
I hate them.
