Are there any good YouTube channels that focus on historical individuals. I.e. character studies of them and breakdowns of their life from start to finish?
One of my favourite YouTube channels is kings and generals, which illustrates historical wars and campaigns from a broad overview. 

It just got me curious about some of the great figures and what they were really like. I personally don’t like reading much but will if there isn’t much good materials through audio and visual medium. 

Thank you!
