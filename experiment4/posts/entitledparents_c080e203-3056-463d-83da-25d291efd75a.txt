Entitled mom demands I date her underaged daughter
Backstory: I’m a 24 year old black dude. Unfortunately, I’ve always looked very young for my age. I’m about 5’7”, skinny, and I have box braids which add to my youthful look I guess. I do have a beard and mustache, but wearing a mask makes them pretty much non-existent. Ever Since I turned 18, I’ve have had an issue of attracting younger girls because they assume I’m around their age. I ALWAYS DECLINE these girls. Anyway, I work as a temp stocker at Walmart. On this particular day,I was wearing a black hoodie and sweatpants. What I do like about working at Walmart is that they let you dress comfortably as long as you don’t look crazy. I didn’t notice at the time, but the sweat pants that I wore clearly showed my print. 

I was minding my business doing the usual work of cutting boxes/stocking shelves. There was some excess baking goods that I had to put on the top shelf, so I had to reach very high. I noticed someone in my peripheral to the right, and I didn’t give it any thought. When I finish stocking the product I look over and see a girl holding chocolate chips staring directly at my crotch. My first thought was to tease her about it. My second thought was she looks quite young. My third thought was NOPE.

She noticed that I caught her, and we locked eyes for like three seconds. She started to turn beet red from embarrassment, and she didn’t speak. I shrugged it off, turned around, and walked away going back to my work cart. I proceeded to see the girl like 4 more times throughout the grocery aisles. She would turn red, put her head down, and run away every time. It was funny and adorable to me.

The next time I seen her she was walking toward me with a lady(entitled mother). When we crossed paths we locked eyes again, and I gave her a smile(all she could see was my squinted eyes). She did her usual look down turn red routine. I stopped to put down and cut open the box I was holding when EM came to talk to me.

Em: Were you just checking out my daughter?

Me: Haha no ma’am. I’m not interested in your daughter

Em: Oh stop it. I saw the way you looked at her. You think she’s pretty, don’t you?

Me: Uhhh yeah she is pretty. I’m just n-

Em: You think she’s pretty it should be that simple and you two locked eyes like lovebirds. You even made her blush.

Me: I can explain that.

Me: I caught your daughter staring at my crotch earlier and she’s embarrassed about it. I guess I smiled to signify it’s ok, and she shouldn’t be embarrassed.

The EM looked directly at my crotch while I was talking. She was looking at it for what felt like a whole minute, but she finally looked up.

Em: OMG, u were sexually harassing my daughter?

Me:😑...

Em: it’s very unprofessional and inappropriate for you to be wearing such tight pants(they weren’t that tight). You’re basically flashing your dick to people!

A few bystanders at the end of the aisle were looking, so I thought that maybe I should dead this situation.

Me: I didn’t flash anyone. I was just working and she was looking at me. No harm was done.

Em: Unless you make my daughter your girlfriend right now it’s sexual harassment. It doesn’t count as sexual harassment if you two are dating.

This statement made me cringe hard, so I said F this.

Me: Ma’am how old is your daughter?

Em: 16

Me: How old do you think I am?

Em: 18 maybe 19

I took of my mask to reveal my entire face.

Me: I’m 23

Just when I thought my cringe meter was full. Em says this.

Em: Look at her. She’s very mature for her age and she obviously likes you. Don’t deny a beautiful young woman.

Me: I bet she is. Beautiful and mature. A young man will be lucky to have her.

Em: You’re a young m-

Me: a younger man. Ma’am.

Em: Age isn’t that big a deal. Her dad is 7 years older than me!

Me: I don’t care

Em: Ok well I guess we need to talk about your sexual harassment with a manager.

I called the manager, and when she arrived Em was quick to tell

Manager: Hello ma’am what is the issue?

Em: This employee has been strutting around flashing his dick in this store and at my daughter. His pants are too tight, and it’s unprofessional and inappropriate for him to wear them. I want him disciplined for sexual harassment.

The manager looked my pants(and crotch) and then looked at me. I responded.

Me: Ask her daughter what happened

The daughter told the manager the truth about how she saw me, thought I was cute, and how I caught her looking. She also said when she came back, her mom asked why her face was red, and she responded with she saw a cute guy. She admitted there was no sexual harassment.

Em was silent.

My manager asked if she still wanted me to disciplined? Em said no and we went out separate ways. 

The manager did say to me I can’t wear those sweatpants to work ever again.
