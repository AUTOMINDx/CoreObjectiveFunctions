My Soul is Tired
Hello. 28F here. 

I'm angry that I'm feeling like this. I'm not poverty stricken, I have friends who love me, I have a job that I can contribute to, I own my home, I have great insurance. I don't live paycheck to paycheck...my life is...well, I find it perfect, really.

I'm just so very tired. So...soul tired. What used to bring me joy just annoys me or isn't interesting. I've invested a lot of energy in community efforts at work, I've given my shoulders to friends in need, and I taken mental health days that I'm incredibly fortunate to be given. 

I've been on a staycation for almost a week and I'm just...so tired. I'm trying so hard to be who I want to be and who I want to be for others...but I'm empty. I have a partner, but it feels empty. Nothing brings me happiness. Giving gifts and cooking for others used to do it...but no.

I'm not planning suicide. I just...lack the energy to live. 

Can anyone empathize? Sympathize? If you have felt like this...what did you do to crawl out of it?
