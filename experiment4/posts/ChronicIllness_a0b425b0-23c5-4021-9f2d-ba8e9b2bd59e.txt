Anyone miss the life they knew before their Illness?
Before my chronic pancreatitis diagnosis I rode horses three times a week, I had dreams of starting out at community college and majoring in liberal arts then transferring after one semester to my dream school(university of new hampshire which I did transfer to )so I could have time on the side to get my EMT license (dept on campus has their own school that does that). And I was majoring in animal behavior and learning how to evaluate which shelter dogs to pull to train as service dogs.i wanted to make a career out of rescuing dogs  from the shelter and make them service dogs....ugh then my school closed my program and the next nearest transfer schools were northern Maine or new York. Then my chronic illnesses flair and it's medical leave and out of the dorm and on the street in 24 hours or homelessness.lucky for me and my dog my best friends parents took us in.i could still take my EMT class but idk of any Dept that would take on a chronically ill employee or volunteer...what about you guys?
