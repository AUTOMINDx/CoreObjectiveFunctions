Is the Kolovrat really an ancient pagan Slavic symbol?
My nephew is into pagan and Nordic history/mythology. He asked his grandma for a Kolovrat necklace for Christmas and insists it’s a historical thing, not a neo-nazi thing. However, the only associations I know of are racist. This extremism website says there’s no evidence the Kolovrat is ancient: https://reportingradicalism.org/en/hate-symbols/movements/modern-racist-symbols/kolovrat 

Thanks for your help. I’m just scared my nephew is getting radicalized into white nationalism right under my nose.
