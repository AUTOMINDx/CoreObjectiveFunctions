Is it a red flag if a guy you just started dating asks you to delete all the guys off your snapchat and delete your Facebook altogether?
I'm trying to convince my friend that right off the bat, this is alarming requests from a man she just started dating a few months ago. It's giving insecure and controlling. 

What y'all think?

EDIT: Whoa fuck this got alot more upvotes than I thought. Unfortunately some women can't read the writing on the wall. I wish her luck but she's already knee deep with this guy. She is more attracted to his looks and status than his behavior. Let's all wish her well!
