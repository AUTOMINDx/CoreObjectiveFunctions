How to reject men when they ask for your number or on a date?
I’ve been getting a lot of attention from men recently that I have no interest in. When a guy asks you for your number or on a date in person, how do you say no?

For the date part, I’ll usually just say I’m busy. But I’ve given out my phone number to too many men I’m not interested in because I’m put on the spot. I usually don’t ever text them or just tell them I’m not interested via text (it’s much easier that way). But I’d like to know how I can reject men in the moment so I don’t feel that cringe after giving my number and walking away.
