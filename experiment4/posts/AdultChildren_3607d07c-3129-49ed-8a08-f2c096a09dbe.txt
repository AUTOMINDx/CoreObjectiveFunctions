What's the dumbest thing your alcoholic parent has started a fight about?
Last night my step-dad decided to pick a fight with my mom about pictures on the walls. He said there weren't enough and that mom didn't want to put up more. That if he was in charge, the walls would be COVERED in pictures of his kids and grandchild. Mom, ever the co-dependent, eventually just started calling herself a loser in hopes of ending the arguement. 

We have the same amount of family pictures on our walls as anyone else. I find it ironic that he chose to try to use this argument as some sort of proof that he loves his family, yet his alcoholism has royally effed up his kids.

Update: When he came home from work the next day and was still sober, he said something was missing from the wall. He thought photos had been removed. I then remembered that I had the ironing board set up against that wall with stuff piled on it for months, which I put away right before Thanksgiving. It made the wall look more bare after it was gone. So he had blown up at my mom for nothing. Didn't apologize for it either.
