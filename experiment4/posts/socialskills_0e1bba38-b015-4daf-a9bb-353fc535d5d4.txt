Why don't people, who want friends, take initiate to hangout/text first?
A lot of people I know want friends (some of them have zero friends), and tell me they want to befriend me. They give me their contact information, and I invite them out and text them. However, they never return the favor. They don't invite me out (although, they accept all my invitations), and they never text first.

After every hangout, they make it clear that they enjoyed our time together, and that they would love to do it again, so I don't think the problem is that they don't like me. Especially since they always come when I ask them out, and respond enthusiastically on text. I really don't understand why someone who wants friends makes no effort back. 

Why do they act like this?
