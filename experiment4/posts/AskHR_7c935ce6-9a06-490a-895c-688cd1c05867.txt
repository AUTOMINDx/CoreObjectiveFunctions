[MO] Doctor Won't Sign Caregiver FMLA Paperwork
My mother is caring for my grandmother, and she has been fighting to get *someone* to fill out the paperwork for her to receive FMLA from her employer for the caretaking she is doing and she keeps running into wall after wall. She is the only one taking care of my grandmother, who is in her 80s, lives alone 3 hours away, and regularly falls and injures herself (and refuses to hire anyone or go anywhere, so my mom cannot get someone else to do the caretaking).

My mom has been regularly driving 3+ hours each way to take her to the doctor or go to the hospital. My grandmother was recently hospitalized for a couple weeks and then had to go to a long-term rehab facility for about another month, and now she is home with my parents. My mother cannot leave her alone to go to work because she is preparing her meals, helping her with daily tasks like dressing and using the restroom, getting her prescriptions, taking her for appointments, and generally doing everything an in-home caretaker would do. My mother is working from home what little she can, but not much of her job can be done remote.

She requested the doctor at the hospital fill out the FMLA paperwork, but they turned her down because they were discharging my grandmother to the rehab facility. The rehab facility turned her down because they "thought she was well enough to go home". My grandmother's PCP, on the other hand, is VERY concerned about my grandmother being on her own and believes she DOES need assistance, but she refused to fill out the paperwork because my mom is "not her patient". My mother is so beaten down trying to manage all this, she's giving up and says "If they fire me, they fire me." Is there any advice I can give her for how she can get the paperwork she needs to not lose her job over caring for her own mother?
