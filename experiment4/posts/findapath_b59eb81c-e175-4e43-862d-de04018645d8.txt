I keep underperforming at simple tasks and jobs. What's wrong with me?
I just struggle at every job. I struggle in retail and fast food jobs. Anything that's fast paced, I keep underperforming at. I took an office internship one time. I tried to do my best but I kept making mistakes and forgetting what to do. I was asking the same question again about separating the files of paper from one another and my boss got mad. Later in, I quit because I felt useless. I have been at these jobs for months and I am still not the best. I constantly keep underperforming at my job and I am extremely incompetent. My current job, I have been at their for a year and I am still slow at completing my tasks. I don't know what is wrong with me and how I will survive in the real world at all. I struggle with understanding things and grasping different information, wether in school or work. All of this seems overwhelming and depressing. I took an IQ test in high school by a psychologist. I scored around 80 with low processing speed. It sucks and I don't know what to do. How will I live on my own? How can I get married and support myself? I ask myself this all the time...
