How did you come to the realisation that you were neglected?
I mean I think neglect hides really well. I feel like it's seen as a better alternative to physically, mentally and verbally abused people. I get told so often by others that they wish they'd been neglected over what happened with them. 
I feel like neglect gets diminished or dismissed.

I found out about neglect when I watched a tv show called 'this is us' where one of triplets' is neglected because the other two had very visible issues that the parents dealt with. I empathized with that kid and when browsing through Tumblr found a quote from 'running on empty', got the book and it felt like I was understood finally and got to name what I felt.
