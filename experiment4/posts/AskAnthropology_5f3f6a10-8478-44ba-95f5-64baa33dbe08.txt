How did ancient Greece get so horrible for women?
I read a comment on AskHistory ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/33x06j/when_did_controlling_cultural_sexuality_become/cqpjzyk/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;context=3)) that explained something about the control of sexuality in Christianity, and in doing so heavily mentioned "porneia" in Ancient Greece. It essentially says that there was a bustling industry of forced prostitutes constantly being sexually assaulted with no rights whatsoever, and if you lost the support of a man you could easily fall into this fate.

So my question then is, how do we go from hunter-gatherer to the dawn of agriculture to this disturbing situation? Materially, what leads to these women being seen as not people? And is there record of them fighting back or escaping? Did things ever get better?
