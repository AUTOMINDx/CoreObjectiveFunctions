From BPD to NPD
Hi, I’m diagnosed with BPD however I feel like over the last couple years, as a result of a specific traumatic experience, that I’m developing more narcissistic traits as a way of coping with the event, and now pretty much fit all the criteria for NPD, is this possible ? Can one switch from having BPD to NPD due to something like this? Can you have both simultaneously? And is it possible to develop NPD later on in life? 
Thanks
