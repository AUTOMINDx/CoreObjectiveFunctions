Kind of embarrassed to ask .. makeup help for 50 y/o ‘first timer’
Would anyone be able to ELI5 - how to put on makeup so it doesn’t look like I have a mask on?  I have almost no experience with makeup.  I have really, heavily, dark circles under my eyes all the time and I’ve been doing a lot of video lately for work.  I look terrible on camera so I’m trying to improve that so people don’t think I’m sick or something.  The problem is, the edges of my face - where it turns to my neck, essentially - shows a clear and obvious boundary between makeup and no makeup and in the real world this is really noticeable. One of my friends happened to notice and made mention I may want to look into ... something... that made me think I wasn’t blending the edges of my face well enough?  

I would be forever grateful for some assistance in this area.   If anyone has the time to explain?   Maybe post a link to a video or something?  

Thank you so much, your help is greatly appreciated.
