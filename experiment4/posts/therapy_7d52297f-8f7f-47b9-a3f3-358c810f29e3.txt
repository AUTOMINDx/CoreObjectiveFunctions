Did anyone else grow up socially sheltered and naive?
I don't really know how else to explain it, as a younger teen I would see friendships and personalities that I wanted to have. I was suffering through extreme social anxiety, no sense of identity whatsoever and the only relationship dynamic I was raised on was an enmeshed one with my mother. I didn't even go to school outside of home. The only social contact I had was online games and social media and even then I would be extremely anxious. I would see behaviors in other kids that I previously abhorred, (vulgar jokes and comments) all around me. I desperately wanted friends, so just like how I behaved around my mom, I just copied them no matter how wrong it initially felt. I became invasive and irresponsible while trying to hide my blank personality and inner feelings. I feel like I became a monster.
