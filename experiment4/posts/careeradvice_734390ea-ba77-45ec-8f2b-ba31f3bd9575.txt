Should I tell a manager the mistakes my coworker makes?
I have been working in a bar for about 4 months. 


Quite recently another guy started working (same position) and he is pretty pretentious -- never shuts up about the previous bar he worked in and all the experience he has had.


But anyways, the past few days I have been running drinks out to customers and so many orders have been wrong/need changing.


When I bring this us to him he always get very defensive and thinks he is in the right. 


For an example, during my shift last night, there was a ticket for gin and regular tonic, instead this guy set out gin and diet tonic. When I asked him to change the diet tonic for regular he kept on saying stuff like, it's all the same and it's the same price and whatnot, to which I responded that it isn't what they paid for and isn't what they want so it doesn't matter.


Another example was when a customer ordered a bottle of ginger beer as a mixer, and this guy got a can of Old Jamaica ginger beer instead of a bottle of Schweppes ginger.


Or even when a raspberry spritzer (which has alcohol) was sent out instead of a regular raspberry drink that doesn't have alcohol. 


One more thing was when someone ordered a vodka and blackcurrant cordial and he didn't even put water in it to dilute it, which could turn someone's stomach because of how strong it was.


When I point out the mistakes he makes he gets awfully defensive and says things like, that's not how I do it, or it doesn't really matter, when in reality, it is a hospitality business where the service customer receive is very very important.


So what can I do here? the guy rarely listens to me when I tell him to change the orders (which sometimes I do myself or ask another coworker to do if they aren't busy) and I don't really want to get a manager involved, because that would be a bit of an asshole move.
