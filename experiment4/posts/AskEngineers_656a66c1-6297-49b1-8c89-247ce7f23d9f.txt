For a first job out of college as a mech eng, does it particularly matter which industry it’s in?
Hey guys. I’ve been offered a role as a mech design engineer in building services at a large consulting firm. 

Due to covid and everything I’ve struggled to find anything at all since graduating even though I have a good degree. I want to go in to mechanical design. I really like fluid dynamics and thermo etc.

But. I don’t think I want to stay in the construction industry for my entire career. I’m seeing this as a good way to gain industry experience in engineering and specifically mechanical design, then transition later on. 

Is this a good idea? I see some people saying first job defines your entire career and others saying just get into an engineering job that’s at least vaguely related. They’re quite a prestigious firm so that would help too. 

I think I’d enjoy the job. Just not what I want to do for my entire career. 

Any advice on this? Thanks
