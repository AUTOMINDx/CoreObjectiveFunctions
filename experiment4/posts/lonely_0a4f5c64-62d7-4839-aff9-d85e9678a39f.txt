I have a question for you all
How do you guys handle feelings of loneliness and emptiness?

Edit: I don't know if you guys are gonna see this but I really wanted to say this to you all. 

That day I couldn't handle with feelings. And I came to reddit, wanted to communicate with people. 

You made my day. I love you all. It may sounds weird but even we are strangers I felt close to you all. 

Some of you worried about my health even we are completely strangers, that made a smile on my face. Thank you. 

I felt your warmth. Even we all are strangers, some of you really wanted me to be okay. 

Some of you were so sad, broken, desperate... I wish I could hug you. I'm sorry you guys feeling like this. It really breaks my heart. If I had a chance I would make all of you happy. 

Thank you so much for all of the advices, sharing your experiences, your feelings. I've read most of it. And I'll read rest of them too. 

I hope you can smile to yourselves. Even in worse situations, I hope you can eat well, sleep well, live well. Sincerely, please be good. Take care~
