PTO upon separation [TN]
Hi everyone,

I am going to be giving my two weeks notice on Monday of this week, in a standard at-will position. My company’s policies state that all unused vacation will be paid out upon separation. My question is can they retroactively fit conditions as requirements for paying the vacation out? 

For example, I do not intend to take part in an exit interview for a number of reasons, or sign any additional documents that they will want me to sign upon separation. Can they refuse to pay out my vacation time if their policy clearly states that vacation will be paid out, with no notice of any other requirements that must first be satisfied? 

Thank you for any insight! I am in Tennessee, which to my knowledge does not have any PTO laws and is instead dependent on company policy. 

Also, I apologize if this has posted multiple times. I’ve been including Tennessee/TN in the title but an auto-mod keeps removing the posts for not having location, so I’m not sure what I’m typing wrong in the title tag.
