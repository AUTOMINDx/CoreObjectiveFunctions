The Process is Working....
16 months ago I went through a terrible self implosion. A divorce and self imposed financial, social, and career destruction. I threw an entire life I had built (on lies, deceit, ego, narcissism, drugs, and alcohol) away. I lost almost every friend I had and burned every bridge I had ever built. 

I had two directions I could have went, and I am so glad I picked the one I did.

Today, in a new city, I'm 16 months sober, 30lbs lighter, engaged in the local CrossFit and Yoga communities. I've run 12 5ks since last September, two mini triathlons, a 10 mile Tough Mudder and a dream come true Spartan 5k race in Fenway Park.  I've read a stack of non-fiction, self help, Yoga books and created a process that has pointed me in the direction that I've wanted to go my entire life. 

It's not perfect, it's messy, and I've been great at it some days/weeks/months, and others I've failed in almost everyway, but I did not give up. Work that can get me moving forward financially has been hard to come by, but I've crawled from two minimum wage part time positions plus Door Dashing, to a full time clerical position with full benefits, time off, etc. 

After working hard, doing the work to the best of my abilities, applying, re-applying, changing my cover letter and resume, writing countless cover letters, attending career development trainings, being rejected for job after job after job within my company....I finally did it. 

I've officially been offered, and accepted not a job, but a new career, doing something connected to my degree, at a \~66% pay increase from where I am now. I now have a vision, a path, a second chance to create a life I deserve and can be proud of. 

Trust the process. Do hard things. Make intentional decisions that align with your goals. Be kind, to yourself and others. Be grateful. You deserve good things. This is only the beginning....
