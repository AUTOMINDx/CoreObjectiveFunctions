I know what to do, How to do it but still can't get myself to actually do it
I know it kinda sounds pathetic, but I think maybe this is a common thing among people who are just getting into self-improvement type stuff. I have list of productive activities and fun hobbies I want to hit throughout the day but I lack something like power or courage to actually go pursue them. I am lazy and maybe also fearful of failure? At the end of the day I feel anxious because I've just wasted all this time. It is really frustrating and I know it is purely my fault, but still can't escape it. Is this a thing you've experienced and if so, how did you get out of this toxic pattern?
