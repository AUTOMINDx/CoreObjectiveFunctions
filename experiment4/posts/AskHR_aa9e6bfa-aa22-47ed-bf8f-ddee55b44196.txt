Scolded for going to HR [TX]
Tldr: Scolded for going to HR instead of direct manager to help employee in domestic abuse situation. 

I supervise customer service reps. One of my reps has been confiding in me that her spouse was emotionally/verbally abusing her. It escalated and she called me crying (while at work) that she was scared to go home that night. I called HR to help get her resources, as well as to find out my limitations on what I can and cannot say. 

I informed my manager that I was working with HR and she immediately questioned why I didn't go to her instead. I told her I didn't know, HR felt like the right step. 

HR gave me resources which I passed along to my rep, and got her to a safe place. 

At the end of the day my manager scolded me for going to HR stating I should have only provided the EAP number and not gotten involved. She also said it took up too much of my day (maybe 2 hrs total). At the end of the conversation she told me if my rep wanted to resign I should just let her and not encourage her to stay. 

Should I have gone to my manager instead of HR? Should I have been scolded for trying to help my rep?
Should I go to HR about my managers treatment towards me?
