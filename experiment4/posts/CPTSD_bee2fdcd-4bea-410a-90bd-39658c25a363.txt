Are you "highly functional" outside and insane in the membrane?
Anyone else?

I am "highly functional" but inside I'm either ruminating, disassociating, hypervigilant or triggered/flashback. 
You would never know what's going on in my head. . 

My therapist and husband can't tell. My autopilot function is phenomenal, so even in moments of panic, dissociation or whatever,  my presentation is "normal". Even at home where I can "break down", it's still very "normal" for my trauma.

It's like looking at a normal, calm looking building, but inside, the silent alarms are going off, there are hostages, lots of chaos, fear, noise and confusion.
