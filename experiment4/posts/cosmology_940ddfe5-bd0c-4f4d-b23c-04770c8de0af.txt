Closed timelike curves within black holes
If CTCs exist past the event horizons of certain kerr black holes, does this imply that a conscious being or AI of some sort could go on a suicide mission and construct a hypercomputer capable of infinite tasks in finite time within one? Obviously no information can be sent out of the black hole so no paradoxes affect the rest of the universe, but in theory does this mean you can perfectly simulate infinite universes within the black hole? This also implies that there is a very high chance base reality is beyond the event horizon of a black hole if we live in a perfect simulation. Thoughts?
