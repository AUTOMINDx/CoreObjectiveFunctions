Should I change my major? From graphic design to computer science
I'm 22, and two years away from graduating with a bachelor's degree in graphic design.
I spent all the afternoon crying bc I simply can't do a logo my professor likes. I'm retaking this class bc I had the same problems last semester and I feel like it will happen again.
So, if I'm gonna lose hair and have shaky hands form stress, should I do it for something more substantial than an useless degree?
