I've felt nauseous since November 6th
On November 6th I stupidly consumed about 800-900 mg of caffeine on an empty stomach and for the entire day I felt very nauseous and had the urge to throw up (Never did though). This was from extremely strong coffee and I weigh about 160 lb, if that's relevant.
Since then almost every day I have this exact same feeling. I thought it was going away until today because as time went on it steadily happened less and less and I just assumed that I was getting better. Today for some reason it started back up just as it did before.
Only way that I end up fighting it back is taking deep breaths and drinking a bunch of water. Another important note is that for some reason I feel even worse when I'm in public but if I'm in my apartment I feel maybe 75% better. (I live alone)

Does anybody have any idea what's up? This is really getting in the way of my everyday life.
