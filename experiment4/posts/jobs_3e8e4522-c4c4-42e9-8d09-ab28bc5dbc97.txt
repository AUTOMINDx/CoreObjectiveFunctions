Would I know if a job is toxic within the first few weeks.
I'm scheduled to start a new job around Jan 10. I saw a ton of negative glass-door reviews so I decided to reach out to 5 or 6 previous employees. All previous employees mentioned they would not recommend this company to anyone  and non of them would go into detail why the company was bad. It was just a lot of vague responses like trust your instinct and they made it a point to say I left the company for a reason etc. 

How soon do you think it would be before you could tell a job is toxic. It's a 100% remote position in project management (the entire company is remote) but it seems like a ton of previous wework employees are here
