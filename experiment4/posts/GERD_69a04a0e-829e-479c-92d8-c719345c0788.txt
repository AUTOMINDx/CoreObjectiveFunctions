Health Anxiety...is this GERD?
Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short. I have a pretty bad case of health anxiety at the moment. It's typically not this bad and I've just been feeling a large amount of symptoms like; getting full easily, some bloat here and there, gas, seems to be a tightness/inflammed feeling in the lower ribs. Mostly on the right side. Theyre semi-sensitive to touch. It's not terrible. Inflammation of cartilage maybe...at least from what i've googled. Also been feeling the liquids go down in my chest or whatever which is a strange feeling.
