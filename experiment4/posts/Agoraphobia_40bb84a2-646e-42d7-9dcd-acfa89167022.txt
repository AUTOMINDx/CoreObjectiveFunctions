Successfully went on a Long Road Trip
Some of you may have seen my posts before where I was terrified of this upcoming road trip.  I couldn't sleep.  I had ruminating bad thoughts of having a panic attack or being stuck somewhere.  The road trip was 8 hours long.  I was nervous at first, but then I calmed down and accepted it.  I wasn't the driver, and I have been on 20 mg of prozac for 5 weeks.  During the entire drive there, I had zero panic attacks.  The drive back was even easier.  We had to cross a big bridge that I am terrified of, but that went by fast with no anxiety also.  We were on vacation for 8 days, and I only had one panic attack the entire time, and it was kind of ridiculous.  I was worried that I wouldn't be able to survive driving in town to the store.  I didn't even worry about the drive back home.  Anyways, I wanted to post this as a success story.  I hope to remember this experience because I put myself through so much stress and worry for nothing.  I could and would go on another road trip in the future.  Exposure is a good thing.
