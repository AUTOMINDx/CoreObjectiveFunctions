Should I move on or ask to be official?
There’s this guy i’ve been seeing for about 5 months now. We act like boyfriend and girlfriend by going on dates, having sex, talking every day, being there for each other at our worst moments. He tells me he doesn’t want a relationship rn bc his job. His job he’s constantly on call for. Sometimes we make plans and he has to cancel because of his job. But idc about all of that, you may not always have time for me but i love the idea you’re all mine. I wanna tell we should just cut the bs and be together but i’m scared to get reject &amp; lose what we have. I’m too afraid to ask him as i’m too afraid to ask it out loud.

EDIT: Thank you for everyone for your wonderful advice, it really open my eyes. I talked to him and he says he doesn’t want a gf then offer to quit having sex.
