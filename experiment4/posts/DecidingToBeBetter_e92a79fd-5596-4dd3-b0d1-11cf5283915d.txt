It's been a year since I was sexually assaulted and I'm still here.
I was technically raped by a boss. I had to go through the process of reporting it and dealing with the internal and external consequences. I spent an entire year wrestling with the worst depression, anxiety, anger, shame, guilt, and paranoia I've ever felt in my life (I've been severely depressed for a while but this was so much worse). I've had to add PTSD to my already long list of diagnoses. I lost my ability to function in spite of my conditions. I relapsed into self-harm. I tried to end it all on my 30th birthday. I am being let go from my job. I am in serious debt because my company insurance doesn't cover anything related to psychiatric care. I have been living out of a suitcase and staying with friends and relatives. But I am still here and I am slowly moving forward.
