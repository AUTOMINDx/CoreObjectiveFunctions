Deactivating fb has made my life better
I deactivated my fb, and have started to do push-ups everyday. I feel like that has done a lot to help me out. I no longer feel the need to get into big debates all the time, get into toxic arguments with strangers. Significantly cut down on all the political shit. I feel like things are for the most part more calm for me. I do miss talking to, connecting with and helping others. But moving away from fb has definitely helped me a lot. I'm really trying to work on being a better person.
