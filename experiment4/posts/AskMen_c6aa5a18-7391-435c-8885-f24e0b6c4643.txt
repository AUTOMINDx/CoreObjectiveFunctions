Men who've worked in female-dominated workspaces, how was your overall experience? Any memorable stories? Any advice?
For a short time, I have been studying in a career that is mostly made up of women, making men a minority. Classrooms tend to be about 25 people, but a maximum of 3-5 are male (including me).

So far, my experience has been very positive in general, although I admit that I have come to notice or feel some minor discomfort/tension due to these circumstances and I have not really been in college for long.

I would appreciate it if you guys share your experience and your advice as well.
