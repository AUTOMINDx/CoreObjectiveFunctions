Is philosophy dead?
In 2009 Stephan Hawking said "fundamental questions about the nature of the universe could not be resolved without hard data such as that currently being derived from the Large Hadron Collider and space research. “Most of us don’t worry about these questions most of the time. But almost all of us must sometimes wonder: Why are we here? Where do we come from? Traditionally, these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead,” he said. “Philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science. Particularly physics."

In the given context, is metaphysics still relevant? Also, would it not be better if philosophers tried to explore epistemology more - considering we live in information epidemic and it is of immense importance - to know what is knowledge and what is not?
