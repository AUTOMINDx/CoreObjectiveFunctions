This is no way to live
I hate my acid reflux so much. Constant chest pain, back pains, throat pains, tightness, shortness of breath, burps, hiccups, globus sensation, headaches, swollen lymph nodes, postnasal drip, congestion, chronic cough, inability to eat basically all of my favorite foods, inability to lie down after eating, inability to eat late at night, inability to eat out at many places, trouble swallowing, need to sleep on an incline which fucks up my hips, the list goes on.  I hate this.  I have been back on a low-fodmap diet for a week, and I'm still having a flare that started a week ago.  Omeprazole does practically nothing.  Famotidine seemed like it was helping but now does nothing. Gaviscon doesn't do much anymore either. Nothing helps.  I have felt like I'm choking for a week.  I am a big foodie and I hate not being able to eat ANYTHING. Even foods I am "allowed" to eat exacerbate the flare.  I barely eat at all anymore.  This is hell.  I wish you could just waltz in and ask for surgery because I don't want to live like this.
