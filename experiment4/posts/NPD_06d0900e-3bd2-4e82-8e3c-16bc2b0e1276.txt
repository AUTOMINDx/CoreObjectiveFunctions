How have you felt since you know?
It’s shaken my entire world, everything from my past &amp; how I behave makes sense now. The thing is it has devastated me, I’m in a deep depression, how can I accept myself &amp; move on with my life, i can’t keep living in my head like this it’s destroying me. One part of me is thinking I have an upper hand for knowing &amp; it also shows I am smarter/more reflective than most narcissists but I know that this is my narcissism, although that makes me feel tiny bit of hope.
