We broke up.

The relationship was much more bizarre than I had written in my post. He had a lot of very strange behavior and comments about women in general. Anyway, we broke up and he said we should check in to see if we were okay in 4 weeks.

He ended up calling me at night and saying how lonely he was, he missed me, and asked if he could send a car to my place... He could only talk about work and his Christmas bonus. He said "I've been emotional but it's been great for work, they've been getting a lot of hours."

Honestly, it was so pathetic. I politely declined.

I eventually spoke to him another time and said maybe we should cancel the meetup, because this was confusing. He got pretty heated and said "We are done FOREVER. I never want you in my life again. Not even as a friends with benefits. There are too many problems in the relationship. I am super busy right now, I have to go," and apparently the coffee was just to make sure that I was doing okay.

Anyway. I feel a lot better now. I think he has too many emotional/mental problems that truly have nothing to do with me.

I have also kind of met someone and we are taking it slow as friends.

And also - I dumped my therapist! As you know, she encouraged me to "teach him," and that "the ball was in my court." - Had I not taken that advice, I would be so much further along with my healing.

I connected with a local women's shelter to find someone who can help me break this cycle of abuse.

I'm really happy and healthy and spending time with people I love. So thank you for the encouragement - I had to read the comments EVERY single day.
