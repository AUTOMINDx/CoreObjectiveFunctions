Are the newer generations actually more sensitive or is the answer somewhere in the middle?
I’m 29 so I’m a millennial but I’ve noticed the past few years my generation and the newer ones seem to be criticized as “too sensitive.” 

In my opinion, I think the statement is a bit hyperbolic and I think there are a lot of times when it’s not about being too sensitive, it’s just times changed and some things may have aged differently or poorly and that’s justified and reasonable but there are times when I’m also like, “ok this does seem like something that doesn’t have to be such a huge deal.” 


Another argument I hear is that things were better in the 80s and 90s and how parents wish they could take their kids back to those times to see how nice and different it was but I’m kind of happy with the generation I was born in? I dunno. Either way, are there any people from the 80s or 90s who can share their experiences and confirm or deny? Any good articles that talk about the subject? What are your guys opinions on the matter? I feel like there’s so many different factors that come into play that just saying “we’re too sensitive” is an overstatement?
