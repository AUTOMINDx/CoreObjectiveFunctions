Are there any non wifi / cloud digital photo frames out there that simply utilize Bluetooth or a direct wifi connection to a phone / tablet, not requiring an internet connection?
This has been infuriating to search for online as all I get are results for digital photo frames that connect to the internet and various cloud services. I'm looking for something simpler - something that can just have photos uploaded directly to it from a phone / tablet via bluetooth or a direct wifi connection. No internet involvement. 

The reason for this is is this would be a gift for my grandmother, who is not technology savvy and doesn't have internet at her house. The ability for myself / family to simply add photos to it from our phones / tablets when there via a local direct connection would be ideal. Even if it's one of the uber smart modern ones that offers this as an option as well, that would be acceptable.

I've found a few true "dumb" ones that only take a SD / USB and/or have built in storage, but this would be a last resort as it's not convenient to update. May be what I have to resort to, perhaps with a system of 2 USB drives I can rotate, but again seems the above should be something available.

Anyone?
