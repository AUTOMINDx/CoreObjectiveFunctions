Ripped off by Betterhelp
EDIT - Betterhelp have just emailed saying they will in fact issue a refund! Which is an unexpected bonus. They sure made me work for it though :)

I signed up to Betterhelp after hearing it advertised on Marc Maron's podcast.

My first therapist was awful - changed the time of our session 15 mins before meeting, the 'hour long session' was closer to 30 minutes, and I could hear her kids shouting in the background.

I complained, and Betterhelp promised to give me a free week (extra session) with a new therapist. I agreed, although canceled my monthly subscription, as I was now feeling wary.

I found another therapist (who was pretty good to be fair) and had two sessions with her. However my third session was on the last day of the month, by which time my cancellation came into effect. So I hadn't been given a free week as promised.

I couldn't contact her, although I could still receive messages from her asking if I was okay, what happened etc? I couldn't respond to these, which was frankly infuriating.

I messaged Betterhelp a number of times - every time they gave me the stock response that they could only help me if I renewed my subscription.

I'm so angry that a company that claims to help people would treat its users like this. Please don't make the same mistake as me, and avoid them!

Also, if anyone knows of an official channel that I can use to complain about them, please let me know.

Thanks :)
