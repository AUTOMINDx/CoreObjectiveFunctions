What was that moment wherein you realized you were better off single than in a relationship?
I (F24) am in a happy relationship, but lately I’ve been having some anxiety that’s probably rooted from my need to feel independent, and previous commitment issues due to a narcissistic ex. For context: my current partner (M25) hasn’t done anything wrong and he’s actually such an amazing person with whom I feel a deep connection with on an emotional level, so these feelings don’t stem from him at all. 

Please feel free to share your experiences when it comes to personal epiphanies, relationship anxiety, or how you approached these situations. I’d love to hear your stories.
