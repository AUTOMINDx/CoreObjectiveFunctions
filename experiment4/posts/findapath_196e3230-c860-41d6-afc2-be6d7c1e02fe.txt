I just can't see myself working an office job of any sort
Maybe I'm just feeling extra \*spiritual\* or something, but since getting injured I've spent way more time at home in solitude the past week, and I've had a lot of time to think. Yesterday, while cleaning my desk and hanging up a poster I got, I was reminded of the things I value.

I value being close to nature and learning about the world. I'm learning another language, and I plan to learn more so that I can travel the world one day and communicate with its people and gain new perspectives. I've seen such a small slice of the world so far that I'm eager to see more of it.

I also continually work to improve myself and I usually have a schedule filled with things like martial arts, fitness classes, piano, language lessons, meditation, reading, journaling, and schoolwork of course. I have it pretty good right now, yet it's unfortunate because I only adopted this lifestyle and the hobbies I've come to love over the past year, and I'm about to graduate high school. I'm going to have to choose a career that will give me no time to do what I care about, and I'll pretty much work until I die. That, to me, sucks the meaning and color out of life.
