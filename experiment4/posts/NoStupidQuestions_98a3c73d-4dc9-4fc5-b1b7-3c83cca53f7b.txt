Am I overthinking or is it a deal breaker?
Starting dating but have caught some things that bother me. She readily throws out how she can drop me in a minute. Mentions all her guy friends that have tried to hit on her and replies back after hours to me compared to when she wants to talk it's seconds. Idc she has male friends but she doesn't want to tell any of her friends she's dating. She also told me she has had a threesome and a high body count all males. I don't mind but I mentioned to her how I don't feel like a priority and that the body count threw me off cus I don't know how I would measure up. Instead of answering me at all she got mad about the body count. I told her I don't mind just I feel like a secret and her willing to drop me if I do or say anything makes it feel like I'm trying to much compared to her. She didn't address this either just is mad I reacted to the threesome news. Am I overthinking or are these red flags?

Quick update: She didn't respond back to me at all and instead even though she was supposed to be busy fir her dad's birthday is out and posted look at this cutie with cake and some random dude. Thanks everyone for the honesty I liked her and should have used my brain instead. Guess it's over
