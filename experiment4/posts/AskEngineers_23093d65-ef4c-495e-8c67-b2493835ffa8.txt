Taking vacation after not being given a raise?
Here's the situation.   I'm an engineer who inherited an upside project when the former leads left the company a year ago.  I'm now doing work/using skills that are far above my pay grade (and have been for a while including working OT).


I'm planning on asking for a significant raise at the start of the year to bring my pay up to what I feel like it should be at.

I'm skeptical that the company is going to want to give me the raise.  If they don't I'm planning on taking my 7 weeks of vacation that I have saved ( which means we will miss the contract dates ) so that I can apply for new jobs (I'm in a super in demand field and can pick up a new job in a month easy).

Does anyone find this unethical?
