Do some women truly just “starfish” in bed?
Woman here. I have always heard this from social circles or reading online content but I find it hard to believe, it’s even a bit comical to me, that there are literally women who spend their sex lives like a dead fish. Does it actually happen?

Edit: I understand there could be trauma/ lack of experience involved in this happening and I’d just like to say to those woman I hope you find as much healing as possible and confidence to enjoy in a safe space with a kind person! Much love!
