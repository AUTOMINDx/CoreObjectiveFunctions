How selective are you with your friends?
I recently went NC with my family and my therapist has been encouraging me to go out and meet more people. I am naturally an introvert so being social is a challenge for me. I think more than anything it’s the shame aspect that doesn’t want to get close to people but that’s a whole different topic.

With that said, I have some old buddies from work that I get along with but not exactly the healthiest lifestyles imo.

There is the saying that you are the sum of the five people that you spend the most time with.

One of my buddies binge drinks every weekend and most of his life revolves around alcohol and partying. My other buddy is a nice guy but his life can be chaotic with drama and fights with various baby mommas. In addition to that he’s very casual about cheating on his spouse and sort of materialistic.

This isn’t intended to be a holier than thou post but I do want to be more intentional about who I invest my time with.

As I am trying to rebuild my social/support network is it wise to invest time into people whose values don’t align with mine? Do i want to have their values affecting mine while I am trying to cultivate a healthier life for myself?

I will say these guys are good guys. Fun, nice, friendly…etc. but their goals and values are simply different from mine.

Anyways, I wanted to get feedback from a community that shares similar values. Am I being too selective. Should I give them a shot?

My instincts tell me to find people that are on the same path but just want to check in with ACOAs who have been down this path.
