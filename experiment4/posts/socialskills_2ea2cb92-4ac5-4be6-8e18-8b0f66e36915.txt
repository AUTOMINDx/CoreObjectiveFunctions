Ran into girl from high school
So I was in the library at school studying for exams and I saw this girl I recognized and barely knew from high school. I went up to her and asked if she was who I thought she was and she said yes. She didn’t recognize me at first (probably because I used to be overweight but now I’m “shredded” because of CrossFit) but once she did she told me I look completely different.

We talked for around 20 minutes and I had to run to take a quiz. Before I left she asked me for my Snapchat and said lmk if you ever need anything.

I’m leaving town for christmas break on the 15th and won’t be back until the 17th of January. I was thinking of asking her to get coffee or something in the coming days… (probably after finals are done)

Thoughts?

Any ideas?
