Community College Professors: What Advice Do You Have For an Aspiring CC Instructor Just Starting a PhD?
Hi all!

I have just started a PhD in chemistry, and feel that most of the mentorship and such I have been exposed to is either “academia” (specifically post doc and TT professorship) or “industry” centric.

My main passion is teaching - I do love research but have no desire for a career in producing it. I have many stupid questions about pursuing a CC career but do not even know where to address many of them, such as:

Do I need to pursue a postdoc, like I would for a research-based professorship? 

How can I build my teaching resume outside of the assigned TA-ships from my program? 

If I apply for and secure outside funding to avoid teaching during my PhD (which many professors encourage in order to increase research productivity), will this actually hurt my chances moving forward in my teaching career?

I know in some fields a PhD is not strictly necessary for a career in CC. But, as I said, I love research, and am excited about my program. I just do not know how best to position myself while I’m here for my next steps.

Thank you!

Edit: thanks so much for the advice everyone! I did not even realize the amount of opportunities that I have available in this area - I just need to be aggressive and active in pursuing them!
