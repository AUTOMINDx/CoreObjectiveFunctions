Did you vote FOR Biden?
I have never met a single person in real life who claims to have voted **FOR** Biden.

Every single person I've ever spoken to who voted for him either voted for \[any Democrat\] or **AGAINST** Trump.

Did any of you look at Biden and say "yup, that's my guy!" and vote for him because you wanted a President Biden?  If so, what was your thought process?  How is he living up to your expectations?
