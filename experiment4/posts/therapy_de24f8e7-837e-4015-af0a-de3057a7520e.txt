Therapist keeps offering to stop session early
I have been seeing this therapist weekly for about six weeks. I've been a little unsure about it because there do not appear to be any structure or goals, or discussion of appropriate modalities. I explained to the service that recommended her that I was looking for help processing a lot of trauma, but in the sessions she mostly just offers generic CBT type of advice. 

She is very quick to suggest that we terminate a session early if there is a lull in conversation or I mention that I happen to be tired that day. I do not take her up on that because I've paid for the full hour and it's not like she's going to refund me partial payment for that time. 

At our last session she said it seemed like we ran out of things to talk about and asked if I wanted to stop early. I mentioned that she asks this a lot and it makes me feel that she is pressed for time. She denied that was case, and said she simply wanted me to be able to use this time for something else if we weren't making any progress. I said that I didn't feel we were not making progress but felt concerned that she seems to feel that way if she is making the suggestion.

I am beginning to think I should just look for another therapist. I don't understand why if there is a lull, her go-to is to try to end the session, as opposed to asking me questions or trying to follow up?
