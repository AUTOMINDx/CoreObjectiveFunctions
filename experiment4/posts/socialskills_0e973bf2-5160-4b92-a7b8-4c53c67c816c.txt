Tip: "Do we...?"
I've been noticing one trick that my super socially skilled dude uses from time to time. Sometimes instead of asking a question using "you" he says "we". For example on one of our first dates he wanted to know if I liked my stepdad, and he said: "how is this guy, do we like him?". It immediately felt like we were part of a team.

If done in the right context (and sparingly) it's an amazing way to create rapport and complicity so I wanted to share it.
