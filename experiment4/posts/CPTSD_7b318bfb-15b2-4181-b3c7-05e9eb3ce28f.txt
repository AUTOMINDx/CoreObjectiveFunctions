My therapist said something I haven't stopped thinking about
We were talking about my trauma and how I'm the perfect concoction for the development of cptsd (eg.: parents moved to another country alone, no family, no contact to anyone aside from parents, abused, money problems, etc. all at the same time). 

And at some point she said "it's not quite the trauma itself but the attachment during traumatizing events".  Had I had at least ONE person that could give me a safe attachment and help me, i wouldn't be or would be less traumatized.

Not a rant, just a thought. That phrase is really impressive.
