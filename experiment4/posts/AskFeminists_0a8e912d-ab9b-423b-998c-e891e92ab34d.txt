Any podcast for a male friend interested in what women have to deal with because of gender?
Sorry for my English. In France we have an amazing podcast called "CÅ“ur sur la table" who talks about pressure women endure (physically, mentally), where it comes from, what it means for relationship with men, what they can do to help and how it also impacts the men, it also has women, men and queer interviews. That's a summary of what I'm looking for if you have any, thank you all.
