15 weeks pregnant - Confirmed Trisomy 21 - Just diagnosed with absent Cavum Septum Pellucidum (absent CSP). Prognosis?
32 F, height: 5’5”, weight: 115 lbs, country: Canada, ethnicity: caucasian. 

As the title says, our baby (who has confirmed Trisomy 21) was just diagnosed with an absent Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP). The results were shared by our genetic counsellor so we did not get to speak to a doctor about this. Our genetic counsellor explained that this points to possible more severe intellectual delays. I have been doing some research and cannot find any studies which associate an absent CSP to Trisomy 21. Reading up on absent CSP’s I see that they are associated with seizures, vision loss, intellectual issues, etc.

Also, I should mention that the baby also has a large cystic hygroma. It measures 9.3 mm at 12 weeks. During our most recent scan (15 weeks) they weren’t able to get a proper measurement of the hygroma at the back of the neck (baby was moving too much I believe), but they were able to get measurements from the sides of the neck. The left side measured 6 mm x 3 mm and the right side measured 5 mm x 2 mm. 

In your medical opinion, how much does the cystic hygroma and absent CSP complicate the T21 diagnosis? What quality of life would our child be dealing with? 

Note: last time I posted the comment section somehow devolved into a debate on abortion. If your medical opinion is that we should end the pregnancy (TFMR), you have a right to share that, I just ask that you explain why that is your opinion and kindly ask that you remain respectful. I received PM’s last time asking me why I wasn’t terminating already and they really lacked tact and grace. This is still our child, our first child at that and although she is sick, we love her and want to honour her life.

UPDATED INFO: The radiology report also says “both choroids abnormal shape.” It also mentions a right Choroid Plexus Cyst of 6x7x5 mm.
