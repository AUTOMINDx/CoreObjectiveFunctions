Why do women do that?!
So i (23m) saw this girl in a coffee shop and she gave me a signal (or as i think) that she wanted me to come talk to her (she kept looking at me, smiling and even play with her hair) so i walked up to here and introduced myself ( which I almost never do but she was so cute) 

Anyway we kept talking for like 15 minutes and then i had to go so i asked for her number but instead she gave me her instagram and then i left

Later that day I sent here a massage she answered, we kept talking for like two or three days then i asked her if i could take here on a proper date (instead of the 15 minutes date we had in the coffee shopðŸ˜…) and she told me that she is busy with work and she would love to go on a date with me but during the weekend and then suddenly she ghosted me for like a week  and then I discovered that she blocked me without any reason 

This is not my first time to be ghosted it happens to me a lot specially on dating sites and I donâ€™t know why this happen, am I doing something wrong or they just being rude or what because I seriously donâ€™t know

I try to get to know her better (any one who is a potential partner) but they answer with one word and I feel that they are not interested to get to know me ( as i think )
