Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. What symptoms are bothering you worst today? Do you have anything you are looking forward to today?
For me, I'm dealing with sjogrens syndrome and I have severe diffuse small fiber neuropathy and I'm having a bad skin day. Just existing is hurting. I'm awake much earlier than normal. 

But at the same time, today is my daughter's first Christmas, and while she won't remember it, my husband and I will. I want to be able to focus on her and him. Not my pain. At least for a few hours.
