How often did people used to come into close physical contact before modern sanitation and sewer infrastructure?
I was listening to a podcast, (about something completely unrelated) and the podcasters were born in the '60s in Yorkshire in the UK. They were talking about how the city they lived in had poor infrastructure, how sewer water would leak into the water supply, and how people didn't touch each other that much. They mentioned how their parents rarely ever hugged them or each other and people weren't constantly shaking people's hands as a form of disease control.

They mentioned that while London was different because people were constantly traveling, according to them if you went back a few decades, the entirety of the UK was like that in terms of not constantly shaking hands, hugging, or getting into close physical contact with strangers.

Are there any books or articles that go more into depth about this?
