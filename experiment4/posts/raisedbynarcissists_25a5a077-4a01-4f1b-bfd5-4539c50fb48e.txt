Posted a picture to my FB about the telltale signs you’re being gaslighted… nMom had me blocked and unfriended within the hour lmao
She was trying to blame everyone around her for not abiding by her every command instead of…yknow…acknowledging that may be an unhealthy way to live? So I threw a graphic I found up there that features a bunch of her favourite manipulative phrases. A bit petty to be sure but it’s not like there’s any discussion to be had about it. All I can do is laugh in a house full of disillusionment.
