I had to quit a job I actually liked a few days ago.
To start off I'm a 35 year old disabled military veteran. I recently decided to quit my job of 4 years because I was being harrased and intimidated by a co-worker... Long story short, since there was no evidence of harassment taking place, nothing was done about it, so I left. 


The decision to leave was made easy knowing that I  receive disabled veteran compensation of about $1700 a month (tax free) which covers my rent/utilities/transportation/ food, and have a bit left over for fun and savings. Also since I'm a disabled vet I receive free Healthcare via the VA hospitals and military health insurance called Tricare...This is the America I wish existed for everyone. It is essentially UBI and Universal Healthcare. I have been receiving compensation and health benefits since I got out of the navy in 2012. I no longer have to put up with BS job politics, my health insurance isn't tied to employment, and in a way I feel like I have the freedom to do whatever I please in life. I hope this doesn't come off as humble bragging but I had to share.
