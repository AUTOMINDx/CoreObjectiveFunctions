Whats wrong with employers these days?
I have been job searching for so long, and i’d be okay and not disappointed if its just rejection letters. However, these HR’s they ask my availability for interview and then when I reply, they ghost me. Like, why would you even ask to go ahead with me if you don’t want me? I didnt even do the interviews. (These are 2 VFX companies) It happened twice already. 

So then i needed money and went to look for barista jobs. I went to a training and gave all my documents after as asked, and promised that i will start working soon. And after all that, suddenly the employer texts me saying they are pausing the hiring. and NOT PAY MY TRAINING!!! 

I am so pissed! I swear I am very proper in real life and not complain like this but why do employers are unprofessional! I can do a better job than that. Lacking basic communication and doesnt respect people’s time is so disgusting. I feel used
