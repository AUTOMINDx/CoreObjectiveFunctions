How do you pick a career path when you're interested in so many different things?
I've always been interested in so many different things and find it hard to stick to or stick with one certain thing. I've worked a ton of entry level positions in sales, warehousing, retail, music, painting, a few others as well and never managed to follow through on any of them or stick with them for longer than a year.

I also have been to college a few times/university for varying things but don't really enjoy any of them. How do I stick with one thing?

Currently I'm unemployed and back with family which doesn't help much considering I turned 30 this following year... Brutal!
