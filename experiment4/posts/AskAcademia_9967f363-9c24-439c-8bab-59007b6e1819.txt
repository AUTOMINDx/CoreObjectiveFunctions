Paper rejected from journal - next steps
Hello AA community, 

I woke up this morning to a rejection letter from a journal I submitted my manuscript to. I submitted this paper about 3-4 months ago, so I was genuinely expecting acceptance with minor or major revisions. I'm in a pretty niche field (between sociology and environmental science) and I felt that the journal in question was the perfect place for my paper. They've actually accepted very similar research papers before, so the rejection was super surprising for me.

Now, this is my first ever submission to a journal - so I wouldn't have been surprised with major revisions. What has surprised me, is that the rejection letter seemed to indicate that they felt the paper wasn't suitable for the journal. The editor said (I'm paraphrasing) "the reviewers feel this paper is not suitable for publication in \[this journal\] and I agree, so we are rejecting the submission at this time". 

They then gave me the feedback from the reviewers, which I largely agree with, and can see their pointsâ€”effectively they said the paper needs work and isn't ready for academic publication, although the research does offer a useful contribution to the field. Still, it sounds like the outright rejection was on the basis of the article not being appropriate for the specific journal; which I don't believe to be the case. 

My question is this: Should I write to the editor, thank them for their time, let them know I will be applying the recommended changes, and ask if I can resubmit once these changes have been applied? Or should I accept the rejection, still make the changes, and find another journal to submit to? I don't want to waste anyone's time or annoy the editors/reviewers if it's inappropriate to resubmit to the same journal. What is the etiquette here?

Thanks in advance :-)
