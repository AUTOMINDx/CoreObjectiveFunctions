[WV] Coworker has positive covid test and his wife was ordered to come into work and that’s the only way I found out. Four people in that area called off sick today. Wife came into my department to inform me. How can this be legal?
Background. I was sick last week and was tested and my covid test was negative and I guess I will get it now. How on earth can it be legal to force people to work when we have all been exposed! I have diabetes, a fib and asthma. I have 4 risk factors. Employer is definitely anti mask and anti vax. I’m triple jabbed but last shot was 3 months ago. What are my company’s responsibilities to us workers? We are made to sign papers saying we call off when sick but then we get yelled and told to come in bc there aren’t enough workers!
