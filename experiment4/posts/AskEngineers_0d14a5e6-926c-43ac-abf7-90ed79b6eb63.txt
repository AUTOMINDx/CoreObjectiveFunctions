People who have been at the same company for 10+ years, what is it about the company that has made you want to stay?
Many of my coworkers are lifers at the company we work for (20+ years is not uncommon). I have often asked what has made them so loyal. Some say it is a generational thing, others say they always felt stable and aren't willing to risk less stability for more pay.


Do you think it is worth the reduced compensation that comes with that kind of loyalty?

Are there other benefits to staying in one place?

Do you regret the decision to stay all that time?
