can a 11/12 year old be neglected?
can't decide if I was old enough to care for myself or if my parents neglected me.

some info. when I was 11 I would make my own Doctor appointments. walk to the doctor, and deal with insurance. when I was diagnosed I went alone and did medication trials on my own. I think this was one of the weirdest things I did alone. 

my parents didn't prompt me to have proper hygiene. this is the big one that I can't decide if I was old enough to deal with this on my own. but I was responsible to do my own laundry and when I didn't it was just ignored. can't decide if my parents should have prompted me to do laundry so I wasn't always in dirty clothes, I didn't know how to shower properly, brush my teeth. my parents did cook dinner but I didn't have to eat if I didn't want to.

my mom wouldn't talk to me about my period, proper bras or shaving. (yikes I thought everyone just dry shaved their legs) 

I was also left alone most nights so they could go out with friends. but they left food for me to make.

also didn't check on my school work just got mad when they got notes that I was failing.

and when I started drinking/doing drugs at 12 they would yell at me then not talk about it again. and I could start it again the next day. also when I was diagnosed with bulimia and self harm at 12 they just said, don't do that anymore.then didn't mention it again.

I feel like this was all not great. but also I was a pretty mature 11yo so I'm thinking I should have been a bit better at this stuff. can't decide if this would be considered neglect.
