It shifts what is the most dangerous branch of the military
In the last century, we've had a lot of wars and battles taking place on the ground, and not as many in the air, or at sea. This caused the spread of the idea that the most dangerous branch always is the army. 

Sure, you could argue that if you go into the navy, it's less likely that you personally get killed while everyone else survives. However, when thinking about war in the broader way, being in the army isn't always more dangerous. 

There has been naval battles were both sides has managed to sink all enemy ships, resulting in the battle having 100 % casualties for both sides. When it comes to the air force, it has sometimes almost been a death sentence just to go up in the sky. Technology is always changing and we don't even know what would happen if a major air war broke out. If a world war broke out today, it's likely that the air forces of the world would have major casualties before the ground forces could even mobilize. 

Being on the ground has major advantages, such as being able to run away on foot if things go back.
