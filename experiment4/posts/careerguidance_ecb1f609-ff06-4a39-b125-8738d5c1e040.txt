Is it normal that my company doesn’t give out an annual bonus?
I work as an accountant at a startup in the 401k space. I just started working here a few months ago but it upsets me a bit that I won’t get any bonus. When I asked HR about it I was told “bonuses are not the norm in this industry”. I didn’t know industries as a whole decide to bypass bonuses, but I’ve never worked anywhere where this is the case. Is this normal for companies?
