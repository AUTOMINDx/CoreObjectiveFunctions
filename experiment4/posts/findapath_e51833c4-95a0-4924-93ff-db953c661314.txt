I have no idea what to do
I’m in such a difficult place in life. My gf is pregnant for the first time with twins and I need to be able to provide for my family. I’ve been unemployed since late June due to a family member being diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. He was having pretty bad episodes frequently and I’ve had to help in anyway I could. It’s now been months and he’s finally getting somewhat stable. I’ve been applying for about two weeks to literally anything and everything. I’ve had no luck so far. I just want something that can offer decent pay and full time as I will need all the money I can get. We won’t have a lot of bills to worry about as I believe I am moving in with her family so I just worried about providing for my children. I have experience of 4yrs as a sale rep for MetroPCS and a few months as a delivery driver for Amazon. Both jobs sucked I’m not the best sale man but I got the job done, and Amazon is probably one of the worst jobs out there. They overwork you and underpay you. But I’m starting to think that that might be my last resort because they hire anyone. I’m stuck I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be rich I just want to be happy and provide for my little family.
