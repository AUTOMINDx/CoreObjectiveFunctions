Why Humanity claims apocalypse has come/ we are at the end of times every centuries or even more
I have been thinking about this topic for a long time , especially old people are obsessed with apocalypse has come and world will end or will be hellish after them. I have been thinking if this is a special thing for our century but I have came across some old apocalypse claimers in internet so I have been searching about this in reddit and Google  I wanted to hear other peoples opinions  but I could not  find anything but only this;

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events

So I have learned that apocalypse claims were very dense in every century. 

I would like to hear other peoples opinions.
What do you think about this topic and what can be reasons about this psychologically.

I was not sure if this sub was the right place by the way sorry if I made a mistake
