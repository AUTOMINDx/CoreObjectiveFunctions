(F26) today is my 10th day of isolation but my rapid test this morning was positive - am I still contagious?
I (F26, double vaccinated and boosted on 12/6) was exposed to covid throughout the weekend of 12/10-12/12. I started experiencing mild symptoms on 12/14 and tested positive on 12/17. Today, 12/24 is my 10th day of isolation. I took a rapid test this morning and it was positive. The pharmacist told me it means I’m probably still contagious and should extend my isolation to 14 days, which really sucks because tomorrow is Christmas. However, I can’t find any information supporting that suggestion on the CDC website. Am I still contagious after 10 full days of isolation from symptom onset? I appreciate your help
