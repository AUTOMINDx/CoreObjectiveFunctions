I was the rescuer, even in my dreams
I grew up with two alcoholic parents. Discovered ACOA and Al-Anon when I was 19 and those groups saved my life. Years later, when my mother hit bottom, she called me. I took her to a rehab facility where she was introduced to AA, and she has been sober ever since. My dad joined her in AA and he died sober.

I haven't been to a meeting for years, and it's starting to show. I'm unemployed and not really looking for a job, I am just blah.

I had a dream this morning. My mother had borrowed my car and called me while she was driving the wrong way down a divided highway. I asked her if she needed me to come get her and she said yes. So with the help of YouTube, I learned how drive a motorcycle, because that was the only vehicle around. As I was about to leave, I woke up.

My first thought after waking up was that it was crazy to drive a motorcycle without training or a license.

My second thought was that the dream was a heavy-handed metaphor of my relationship with my mother. It's been observed that I am the adult in our relationship. When I set off for my first 12 step groups, I didn't know what I was doing. I was away at college, so my parents didn't know I was going to the meetings. They realized it later, after I graduated and moved home. And when my mother hit bottom, I hopped on my metaphorical motorcycle to go get her.

So hi, I am Mermaidpaint, nice to meet you. I am glad I found this subreddit.
