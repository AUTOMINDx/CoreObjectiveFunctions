Stanley Kubrick and Agoraphobia
Stanley Kubrick was one of the most accomplished film directors of the 20th century, creating such groundbreaking films as Dr Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and A Clockwork Orange. Though he traveled as a young adult, he developed an intense fear of flying and traveling, and found ways to work around that difficulty. Of course, other famous and accomplished creative people had also had various phobias as well. I get some inspiration from the Kubrick story because, though he didn't solve his problem, he didn't let it stop him from having a creative, productive and meaningful life.
