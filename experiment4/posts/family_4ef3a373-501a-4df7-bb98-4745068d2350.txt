Parents complain about bills but refuse to work?
My dad is retired and disabled from 20+ years in the Army. My mom recently and voluntarily quit her job because she was becoming the workplace snitch and people were beginning to give her the cold shoulder. Which then caused intense stress and anxiety. 

Now, they both don’t work and are constantly saying that they are fine and will survive. They are not the best when it comes to finances, and I’m afraid that this isn’t true. I think they are doing okay with the money my dad brings in for retirement but they don’t have the means or desire  to travel or do anything other than sit at home. 

They are constantly cutting corners, they can’t figure out how to stream Tv And claim that subscription services are too expensive, which is why they switched to cable only. 

It’s incredibly frustrating to always hear “give me money” as a joke when I suggest a better solution for entertainment, or anything related to money. 

My mom is always asking questions like “how much did that cost” and it’s starting to rub me the wrong way now that I’m an adult. What does it matter what it cost?

Since they can’t afford to move out of the home they’ve lived at for 20+ years, They used to say that I need to buy them a house in my name, closer to where I live, and they can pay rent. Like absolutely not. 

My mom is Filipino so some of the things she says or asks is pretty direct — but it’s just difficult to break the cycle with them or give them financial advice. 

How do I handle parents of this type?
