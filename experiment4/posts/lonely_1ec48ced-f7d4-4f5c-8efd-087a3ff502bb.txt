Could anyone just comment and say hi?
I just keep getting let down hoping that my friends might reach out to me to say hello.

I used to have a great friend who shared a similar interest with me and we would play games together. He would reach out to me just to chat or sometimes ask me if I wanted to do something. Due to IRL circumstances he needed to move on and I don’t get to talk to him much at all anymore, sadly.

It was such a good feeling to be reminded that I existed, that someone else remembered me and actively took steps to spend time with me or talk to me because they wanted to, and not because I started the conversation for the 100th time.

So often now do I find myself reaching out to people to do things or even just talk and they decline my invitations and don’t attempt to hold a conversation.

I just want to be wanted. Because… when no one tries to spend time with you or talk to you, it feels like they forgot about you. And my hopes and expectations are so low now that I just want my friends to maybe once every so often say hello these days.

I don’t think I’m suicidal but I’m tired of hoping things will change for the better.

Edit: If I stop replying I apologise it is only because there have been so many kind people reply and it’s almost 4am here and I’ve probably fallen asleep. Tonight started off really poorly but getting to talk to people from across the world for no reason other than to just say hi and talk has made me feel not terrible.
