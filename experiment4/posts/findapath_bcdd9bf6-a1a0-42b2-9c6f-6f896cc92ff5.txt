I don't feel motivated enough to pursue anything with confidence
I just feel i'm not interested enough in anything and i feel like an imposter all the time. I'm studying something in uni (1st year) that turns out I don't love but i quite like nonetheless. Seeing other people enthusiastically talking about the area of interest, jobs , careers etc makes me feel out of place and time.

another thing is, i'm not sure if i have the mentality for university studies or university life in general but everyone is telling me that it's going to be a shame if i don't pursue a degree since i have always been the "gifted kid". I mean not really gifted but really good at school in general.

There are certainly things that i feel a bit more comfortable in the thought of doing but i'm neither sure at all if it is worth pursuing long term, or if i would actually be able to do as jobs or if they're going to be paying enough for what i'm going to be going through 8 hrs a day.

I feel guilty for all the money, effort and stress i've undergone to get where i am now if i decide this is not for me and then change majors.

How does one suffer less in the thought of not being sure about what they're doing is really for them?
