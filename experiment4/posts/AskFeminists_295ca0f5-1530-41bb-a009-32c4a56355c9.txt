Why dont more women own guns in america?
First, Im not an advocate of 2A. Im not pro gun whatsoever. 

However, in some of my research women are the gender more likely to experience violence than men. The studies are pretty conclusive and consistent on this metric. However, Men are also 3x more likely to own a firearm than women in the USA.  Men are also more likely to defend 2A rights. 

It seems, based on this information, it would make sense that women would be more likely own guns to protect themselves, and would be more likely to advocate other women to protect themselves.

What are your thoughts on this?
