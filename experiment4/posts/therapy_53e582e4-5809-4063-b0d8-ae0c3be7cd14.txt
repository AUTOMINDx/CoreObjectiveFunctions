I told me therapist I was racially harassed almost everyday in uni and he responded with “bullying happens to everyone why is it effecting you of all people negatively”.
I felt a little bit judged by his comment. I put up with harassment and bullying for years. Until I reached a point where I couldn’t tolerate it anymore. I don’t see how this indicates something is wrong with me.
Toxic uni environment, hostility and hatred from classmates wasn’t easy to deal with.
