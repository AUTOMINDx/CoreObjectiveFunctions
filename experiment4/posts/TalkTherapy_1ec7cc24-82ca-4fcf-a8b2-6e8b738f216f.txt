I found out my psychodynamic therapist who I barely know anything about is friends with a public figure whose social and political ideology I very much disagree with…
I know I should probably tell her, and I guess I will - but right now I feel like this has completely ruined our relationship and I’m not sure what can be done to fix it. 
I’ve been seeing this T for two years twice a week and she has helped me a lot, but right now I feel very much betrayed, like I can’t trust her or her empathy…
I also feel a lot of shame regarding how hard I have taken the news, I’ve been crying all morning and feel pretty much devastated… 
Has anyone ever gone through something similar with their T? Can it be fixed?? Any advice on how to proceed?
