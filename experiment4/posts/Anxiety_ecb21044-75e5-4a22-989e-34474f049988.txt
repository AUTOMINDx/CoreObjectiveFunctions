Constant fear of a loved one dying
Hey folks,

does anyone else suffer from a constant fear of a loved one of yours dying. Ever since I was a child when my parents got home late I always freaked out and felt like they already died. Im 28 now and it has fixated on my girlfriend. When she is not texting back for a long period of time I always expect the worst.

I dont know if I ever suffered an attachment trauma or if it is just a symptom of my GAD in general.

Can anyone relate? (excuse my english btw)
