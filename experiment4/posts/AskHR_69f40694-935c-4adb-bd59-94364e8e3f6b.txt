[IN] What’s the point of being paid by the hour if you don’t get paid for every minute you work? Is this legal?
The time clock system at my work clocks us in/out to the nearest 5-10 minutes. It always rounds up or down, which ever benefits the company more. 

For example: If I start at 8am, I might clock in at 7:50-7:55 (it wont let you clock in any earlier than that) to get a head start on my work, but I automatically get clocked in for 8. I clock out at the end of the day and it’s 4:07, I automatically get clocked out for 4pm. 

It’s just frustrating in which my lunch breaks involve staff breaking each other for lunch. One of my co-workers is always late coming back from her lunch break, so if I’m scheduled to be on break at 1:30, my coworker is pulling into the parking lot at 1:35 and doesn’t get to relieving me until 1:40ish. I clock out but I’m automatically clocked out for 1:30. So basically just missed out on 10 minutes of my own lunch break and can’t ever get paid for that.
