My Dr Denied Me Antidepressants
I have been seeing a therapist for about 4 months. After my most recent visit, she told me that she doesn’t often recommend medication, but she suggested I talk to my Dr about starting Wellbutrin. She said that it is non addictive and very mild, but could see it helping me.

I called my doctor and he was 1) very dismissive of the fact that a LSW is making this recommendation and 2) said people who go on it have a hard time coming off of it. He also said that I would have to have my blood monitored by a psychiatrist if I went on this. He wanted me to schedule an appointment to talk to him about other options, which doesn’t sound promising to me. He is very old and very organic. I do not feel comfortable sitting down and discussing my mental health with him. I never have.

I told my therapist all of this and she was very surprised. She said I can get through this without medication, but it’s a suggestion. She said that if I am uncomfortable speaking to my primary, I can talk to my OB/GYN. Which I found to be surprising. I am very comfortable with my OB/GYN.

What are your thoughts on this? Has anyone experienced anything similar?

I was very excited and hopeful to begin medication, and now I feel like it’s not attainable.

Thank you.
