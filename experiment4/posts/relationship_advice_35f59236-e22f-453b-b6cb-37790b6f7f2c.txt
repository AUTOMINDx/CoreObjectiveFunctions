My girlfriend wants to try drugs [m23] [f23]
In a couple months my partner of 2 years will be going to a three day music festival with a friend, I believe she wants to try acid and mdma for the first time. At the moment my partner is currently on antidepressants and struggling with an eating disorder and is currently underweight, I have brought it up with her that I don't think it's a good idea at the moment and I'm uncomfortable with the idea of trying these things for the first time while she has all these other issues going on as well, I'm very concerned for her health and I'm scared something may happen. I'm unsure on what to do and how to go about this situation.
