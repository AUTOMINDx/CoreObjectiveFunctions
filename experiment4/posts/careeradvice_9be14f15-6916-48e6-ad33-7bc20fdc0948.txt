Should you always avoid saying negative things about your coworker to your boss?
I've been out of college college for about 3 years and I've never felt I had any issue with a coworker until now.

Basically, how he acts is if you ever say anything or ask anything he believes has already been mentioned or asked, he'll give you about a 5 minute lecture.  His 5 minute lecture will be about how he believes you're not following a procedure correctly or how he thinks you're unintelligent. I'll give an example:

Me: Hey, do you know if the report is due on Thursday or Friday next week. I'm unsure if it got changed?

Him: This was already mentioned in our meeting 4 days ago at 10:30 am meeting with Cassidy. It sounds like you're not doing a good job listening or following instructions. Haha I'm just shocked right now how you don't know the answer to that. That's a very simple procedure you should be able to comprehend properly and clearly you're not.  *sighs* it's due on Friday. 

Me: ok thanks

Him: *will most likely give a 5 minute lecture saying similar things*


Then if you ever say something he thinks has been mentioned more than twice, he'll get even worse. He'll give you probably a 10 minute or long lecture.

Even if you had no idea that you're asking something twice he'll still talk the same way.

I guess I'm just used to a different kind of culture. When I was a Support Analyst I remember clients asking me thing at least 5 times in a row. It didn't bother me at all. I view that as helping the person answer their question. Plus I'm getting paid. 


Anyways is it bad if I suggest to the manager that the guy should calm down. The guy has a bad reputation anyways. So, maybe it doesn't matter.
