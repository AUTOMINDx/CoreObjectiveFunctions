Is it weird that I want to be a stay-at-home wife even though I have a masters degree?
I went to school for 7 years, got two degrees and have the potential to earn around 75k. However, I quickly realized that the career isn’t what it’s cracked up to be. I also developed severe anxiety from it. 

Anyway, my husband will be earning six figures in the next two years. I’m thinking I should just be a stay-at-home wife. Is that weird? My husband says he is okay with either choice. 

I also do freelance writing on the side, so I do pull in a few hundred every month from that and could potentially earn more if I look for another website to write for.

Edit: we don’t have kids, but plan to in the next two years and I plan on being a SAHM when we have kids, not now.
