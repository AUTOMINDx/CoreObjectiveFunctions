Why do people consider me selfish for not wanting children when I was not allowed to be a child?
Why do people consider me selfish for not having children, when I was not allowed to be a child myself?

I am 33 f. I spent my childhood, teens and young adulthood on raising my two younger brothers and my irresponsible mother. 
I had NO freedom whatsoever. Every day I got home from school, I had to look for after my brothers, go grocery shopping for my mother or clean the house. This started from I was around 11. 
I was told when I was 11 that «I was too old to only think about myself», « I needed to be more responsible» and «do more around the house». 
My mother always told me how tired she was and that she needed to Watch tv. She didn’t care if I was tired after a whole day at school. 
I was not allowed to meet friends. Not even in the weekends. 
I was always told that I didn’t do good enough in the house and that I was selfish, even if I had no free time left. 

Why don’t people owe me my freedom now when I am free? Why do they assume that I don’t like children? Why don’t they want me to travel? To get an education? 
I missed out on so much. Why do they judge me? 
I feel that I have done my duty with kids and I want to be able to enjoy my freedom. 

The pressure to «settle down» and have kids when you are 30 is inhumane. 
I was like a 35 year old mother of 2 when I was 13. 
Now, I just want to be young.
