I wish I could just worry about my health instead of money.
I am so tired of having to worry about money instead of my health. It is my biggest anxiety and it seems crazy to me to have to worry about that when my health is deteriorating. A disabled friend of mine has told me that her worst problem is not her disability, but the financial instability that comes with it, and she is so right. It's a sick world.
Edit: I tagged this wrong, it isn't a question, it's a vent. Sorry.
