What is the oldest publicly traded company that could invest in today?
**EDIT**: Sorry, this question is a little hard to phrase. I'm wondering, if I came upon a stock certificate from the 17th or 18th century, what company would it be that I could still trade that stock on the market? 

For example, if I came across a paper stock for Consolidated Electric from 1824 that had been in my family for generations, I believe I could take it to a transfer agent and get money for it. Even if that's impossible, Consolidated Edison is still the oldest stock still being traded on the NYSE. So I'm wondering if Europe has any examples of stocks that predate Consolidated Edison that are still being traded today

I think it's because l'm in America, but when I type this search into Google seem to only get 2 categories of results:

1. Oldest publicly traded company on the NYSE (because only the NYSE matters, right?)
2. Oldest company in general (because no one cares about European stock exchanges that started in the 17th century, right?)

So l'm curious, are there any stocks from companies that went public in the the 17th or 18th century that are still trading today?
