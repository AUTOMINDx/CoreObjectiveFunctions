Resigning tomorrow - would like to address a staff situation in my letter. Your thoughts?
For the last 6 months, I've been working to get one of my direct reports a wage adjustment.  This person was an internal transfer, and they were underpaid in that position also.

My supervisor has used every kind of delay tactic possible, blaming the timing, the current budget, the upcoming budget, *his* supervisor, etc.  Last week, he finally confirmed that his supervisor is going to discuss it with HR, although at half of the amount I had initially requested.  

A few days later, I got the written offer for a new job that had been in the works for over a month, and tomorrow I am giving my resignation, along with 30 days notice.  As part of my letter, I will put something along the lines of "reviewing all of our projects and helping my team prepare for the transition, blah, blah, blah".  

But I'd like to specifically call out the wage adjustment, as I'm concerned that once I'm gone, this will be dropped and this person will not receive the adjustment they so truly deserve.  So I wanted to say something like: "I know my team will be up to the challenges facing them, in particular *this person*, who has grown so significantly in the time they've been with me.  I hope that my leaving will not affect the wage adjustment for them, and with all of the new responsibilities they will be covering, I also hope that you will reconsider and give them the full amount of the initial request."

And then I'm going to send it to this person also.

What do you think?
