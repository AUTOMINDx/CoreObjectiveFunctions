What battle do you find most interesting in which the locals - considered grossly less-than by the invading culture - decisively sent their attackers running to their ships/ graves/ unknown fate?
Battles big and small, from anywhere in the world.   


Mine is theÂ [Battle of Chicasa](http://www.msarchaeology.org/maa/johnson.pdf), where the Chickasaw Nation chased and slaughtered naked conquistadors running from their flaming huts into a very cold winter night.

De Soto died of a fever shortly after, and his body had to be put into the Mississippi River to save it from being mutilated by the Chickasaw. The last De Soto expedition was a failure.

  
The ferocity of the Battle of Chicasa echoed for centuries. The Chickasaw were dubbed "The Unconquered and Unconquerable" and Europeans avoided Chickasaw lands for the next 130 years.  


The traditional dish of the Chickasaw Nation is pashofa, which is hominy corn and pork...the descendants of the Spanish pigs they captured after the battle. It is still eaten today.
