I’m 19 and developed agoraphobia and it’s the saddest thing that’s ever happened to me
So I was working at amazon for a little over a month and towards the end of my employment I would get insane panic attacks before work and couldn’t bring myself to go in. And update in less then a month it’s been going terrible I barely can go out without feeling like I’m gonna cry cause I’m so anxious. I couldn’t go to doctors appointments without taking Xanax before and I barely can go grocery shopping. I’m starting to fear the stuff I once enjoyed like shopping, hanging out with friends and etc. all I wanna do is stay at home it’s where I feel the most comfortable and I know that I’m safe. But my mom keeps telling me I have to get another job eventually but she doesn’t understand how bad I’ve been suffering. It feels like I’m scared constantly and I’m crying just writing this. I screwed up everything. Everytime I attempt to work it doesn’t last more then three months…
