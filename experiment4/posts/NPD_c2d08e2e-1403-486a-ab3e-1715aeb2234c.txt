blade Runner
I feel like I’m a replicant. Since I don’t really seem to have a true sense of a core personality (other than like pure negativity and a downer of a position), often I catch myself emulating the traits of other people, to a tee. It’s like I catch them in myself. I’m sure in psychological terms it’s called mirrorring and is a part of being an underdeveloped person. To what extent is it normal, i.e. as is often said, you are the combination of the 5 persons you hang out with…yet I concurrently sense it being way more than that. 

When watching the modern Blade Runner, it just hit me like a ton of bricks how I’m basically exactly like a replicant, with all the similar attributes they have, envy of those who are “real” and authentic. I’m basically a chameleon and adjust my skin to my surroundings. Some skins just feel way more familiar than others. In truth an amalgam, ghastly, a spectre.
