Man I'm just so..... frustrated at hearing this misguided sentiment from well-meaning friends. People who have safe families of origin have NO FUCKING IDEA what that word really means.        
     
Like yes, if I show up at your house crying at two in the morning you'd let me sleep on your couch. But are you going to pay for my therapy if I'm too mentally ill to function? If you move across the country are you gonna fly back for the holidays to see me? If I'm injured and can't work will you take care of me? A close friend has a couple of these in them before they've got to focus on their own family they're building, with a spouse or a kid. It has conditions. And I'm not saying I'm not grateful for every time someone in my life has picked up the phone when I'm a mess. But I really wish people wouldn't toss the word *family* around so casually, when they can't fathom how precious it really is.       
       
I have one friend in my life who I actually consider my sister, she also doesn't have a safe family of origin. She's offered to help pay for therapy (she's not wealthy), she's picked me up off the ground more times than I can count. She's let me live at her house a moping mess for months. She drives hours to come spend holidays with me. If she needed a kidney she can have mine. But this relationship was built mutually over years and years. I feel so incredibly lucky. She's not who I'm ranting about in this post.      
      
I think people just really want to be there for others, and the intention is so loving. I wish they understood how damaging it can be though to use that word, only to not follow through. Family is a big word.
