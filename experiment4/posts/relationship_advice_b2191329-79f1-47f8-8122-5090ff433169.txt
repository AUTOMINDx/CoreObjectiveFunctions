Update: I (34) might be a boy’s (15m) father and I’m anxious about telling my wife
Thank you for all your helpful advice when I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r2typt/i_34_might_be_a_boys_15m_father_and_im_anxious/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)  before. It really eased my nerves about telling my wife because you’re right it’s not like I cheated and I never even knew about the kid. After I told my wife we reached out to his grandparents to arrange getting a paternity test. My wife and I talked many times even before the results came in. This was wild for her. As it was for me. But she told me if he’s my son then he needs me and she hopes I feel the same way. I do completely. Not gonna run out on the boy for my own actions. I’m glad we were on the same page about that. The fact that she told me she would’ve lost respect for me if I didn’t want to try being involved or at least support my kid was heart warming. She’s incredible. 

Got the results back a couple days ago and we took a look together. I’m his father. I don’t know why but I was crying. My wife hugged me, honestly I don’t know why I did. It just hit me that I’m a father and all the time we missed together. We talked to his grandparents again and I got to talk to the boy for a minute. Mostly to tell him I’m sorry for how I initially reacted with him and that wasn’t fair to him. Kid seems really eager for us to meet (I am too), he asked me if it’s okay to call me dad and I’m like of course it is. We’re still trying to figure things out in terms of scheduling a meeting. He has my number now and he texts me everyday. Nothing in particular just to say hi . But it makes me smile and he seems like a sweet boy. My wife says he has my crooked smile. I have no idea how she’s managing this so well. I’ve been a wreck these last few days. Going from panicking “holy fuck I have a son, what am I gonna do???” to feeling sad and guilty about missing out on his life, and then talking nonstop about little stuff he’s told me about himself so far. 

I’ve even asked my wife how the heck are you so composed right now?? The following days after I told her she was distant while she tried to process it but now she’s in that let’s get down to business mode. She thinks maybe it’s just her way of still processing this. I’m so grateful I told her. Having her support has made this a lot easier
