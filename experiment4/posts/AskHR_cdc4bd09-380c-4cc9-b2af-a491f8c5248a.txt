[CAN] After signing a job offer with a company, I am getting a higher counter-offer from my current employer. Little confused and need advice how to proceed.
I signed a conditional job offer with a new company at $80K upon successful completion of my background checks. As background checks cleared yesterday, and I talked to my current employer about this job offer. They are ready to bump up my base to $87K. However, I really don't like working at my current job for various reasons. This pay-bump though has confused my a little bit. I think I still prefer to work for the new company at $80k than my current employer at $87K. However, can I bring this up to my new employer AFTER I have already singed the conditional offer and my background checks are cleared and use it to my advantage? Is this advisable or not?

Edit: I had already negotiated my salary from $75K to $80K before signing the conditional offer.

Disclaimer\*: I would still choose to work for the new job at $80K over current job at $87K, even if their answer is NO.
