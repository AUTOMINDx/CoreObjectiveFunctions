Bloodwork tomorrow, very scared
Hi, so.. I'm pretty new to all this, not even sure if i'm truly agoraphobic. But i've had two major panic attacks in public back in July, and i've been terrified to go out in fear of panic attacks ever since.

But tomorrow i leave the house for the first time since August, not counting riding around with my friends and family who go in the shops while i sit in the car ashamed.

Because of some preexisting medical conditions. I have to have bloodwork done every year.  
Hospitals stress me out as it is, i hate the wait, and i don't like needles. To put the fear of having another panic attack in public on top of all that terrifies me.

I've literally worried myself sick thinking about it weeks and months prior.. And tomorrow's the day i go in..
