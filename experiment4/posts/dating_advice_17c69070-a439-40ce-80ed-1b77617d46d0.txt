He doesn't want sex again because I was "too easy to get"
After some time of low-key flirting I (23F) had sex with a very attractive friend (21M) after a party. He initiated and albeit not totally crazy, the sex was fine (I liked it and he seemed to be into it too).

Fast forward about two weeks, I was pretty much in lust with him and met him at another party. I expected us to do it again but no luck. By then the situation was kind of bothering me so I decided to be brave and ask him about it straight up. I told him I wasn't romantically interested whatsoever but enjoyed the sex and would be interested in a friends with benefits situation. And that it would of course be totally fine if he wanted or didn't want to and that I just needed clarity.

He said he didn't want to sleep with me again or enter a FWB because he hadn't liked the sex enough. His reasoning:  
\- It had been too easy to get with me  
\- I had seemed to want it "too much"  
\- He would've preferred more of a "challenge"/a mysterious partner

He's a very attractive, lowkey narcissistic person with quite an ego (thinks of himself as an "alpha male") and so it didn't come as much of a shock, but I'd still like to know your guys's opinions on this reasoning and what makes people think/feel this way. I personally hate the whole "playing hard to get" thing, I'd much rather always know where I stand and let the other person know too. For relationships but also casual sex to be honest. Why should I as the woman play hard to get and be a "trophy" for some immature guy to win? I want sex, he wants sex, we do it. "I didn't like x, y, z during sex", "I don't think we're sexually compatible enough", "I didn't enjoy it enough to repeat it" seem a lot more valid to me than "you were too easy to get with"...
