[NV] Is my perspective employer allowed to hire me on as salary?
I work as a registered nurse and I’m in the hiring process for a company as a staff nurse. This position is not a leadership role and I wouldn’t be in charge of anyone. Today, they told me the position is salary based which left me very confused. I’m certainly no labor laws expert, but I was always under the impression that certain criteria had to be met before someone could be considered for a salary based position?
