Why is NPD a joke to so many?
I have yet to get a diagnosis but after 2 decades of research and comments from others, it's likely NPD or BPD. That's for another thread however.

I almost can't find answers to questions about getting better without seeing "how to recover from NPD abuse in a relationship" "Narcissist are monsters who feel nothing". I'm even in a FB group for NPD recovery and most of the posts are either trashing people with NPD or people with NPD being very stereotypical. 

My question is, I hate that I'm this way and I see others do too. Can we get better? Why are we overlooked in the mental health community and society? I've read horror stories of psychs saying oh I can't treat that. I personally had a counselor tell me I didn't have BPD bc I'm a male and have never attempted suicide. 

For me, it hurts seeing us cast aside as worthless and untreatable. Maybe it is me being a Narcissist, but I think we deserve understanding. It took a good person to tell me I needed help and that maybe I had this but pointed out the possible causes and ability to get better. I'm forever grateful as I start a journey with hopefully a capable psych next month. 

Sorry I got off topic a lot
