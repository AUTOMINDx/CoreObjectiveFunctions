Were there highly idealized warriors such as knights of Europe and Samurai of Japan in other cultures?
I originally posted this to askhistorians but overnight realized that with the broadness of the question it may be better here.

Both knights and samurai were real groups of people in history. They both were, at least to my basic understanding, a form of nobility (or at least those in a higher social sphere than most) that acted as well trained warriors for the landed elite. In fictional stories both became a form of symbol. Often being portrayed as brave and honorable warriors that uphold a lot of their cultures values.

Did other societies and cultures also have a class of elite warriors like these two examples and if so did they take up a similar role in their own culture's fiction? I'm most curious about Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese versions of knights/samurai if examples exist but I'd love to hear about any cultures that had them.
