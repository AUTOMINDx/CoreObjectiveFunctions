My therapist “diagnosed me” as mentally retarded
So yesterday my therapist was explaining that my issues of depression are very bad and that she was concerned for me. She said that I should try to fix my problems which I didn’t understand since i’m literally at therapy to do that. She then asked if I’ve also had trouble focusing in the past and I said yes since at work I space off a lot and she said that she has a suspicion that i’m “mentally regarded” I asked if that was the correct phrase and she said yes because it’s “right in between autism and asperger’s”. I didn’t wanna argue because I was already having a bad session and it was a bad day. I’m thinking of stopping seeing her since she is wildly unprofessional.
