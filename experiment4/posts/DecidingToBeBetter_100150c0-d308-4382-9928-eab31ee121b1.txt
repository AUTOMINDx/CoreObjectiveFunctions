How can i resist the urge to give my unnecessary opinion during conversations?
I have recently noticed in my myself that i tend to give unnecessary opinions during conversations. Like if someone is discussing about something, i'll comment on it (sometimes negatively). That comment /opinion is highly unnecessary and not required and sometimes project that i think pessimistically about certain things and nag. I really wish to stop this behaviour. It's not an extreme behaviour but yes, it is recurring. 

Any advice on this would be highly appreciated! Thank you.
