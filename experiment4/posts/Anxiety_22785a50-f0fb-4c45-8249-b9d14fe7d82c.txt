How do some people seem so stress free when it seems like being an adult is so complicated?
There's a car insurance bill, car payment, internet, gym bill, groceries, phone, plus trying to save. Some bills are automatic and some aren't and I just can't wrap my head around it. 

I'm 20 and so confused. It also seems like many people my age move out and can buy Starbucks every day and go so many places but if I did I'd have to budget and those actions would be pretty irresponsible if I did them a lot. How TF do people operate??
