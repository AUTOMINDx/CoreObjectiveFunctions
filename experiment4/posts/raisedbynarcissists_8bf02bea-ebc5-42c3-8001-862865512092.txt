My nmom doesn't apologize. She just Starts being nice to me
The title is pretty much. I don't understand what the logic behind it is, but it happens a lot of the time, and when I confronted her she outright said "I'm an adult and I don't need to apologize"

That is the worst fucking logic I have ever heard in my life. Fuck all parents who are like this.

IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, APOLOGIZE TO YOUR FUCKING CHILDREN!! THEY DON'T DESERVE TO BE INVALIDATED JUST BECAUSE YOUR EGO DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO ADMIT THAT YOU FUCKED UP!!
