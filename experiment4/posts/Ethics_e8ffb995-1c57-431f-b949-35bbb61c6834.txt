(Not) Supporting those whose views are abhorrent
There’s a commonly held view that we shouldn’t support people who are or were actively involved in wrongdoing. For example, one that I’ve frequently come across is the view that Wagner‘s music shouldn’t be performed because of his Nazi affiliations. The atrocities committed by the Nazis were abhorrent; but at the same time, Wagner’s music was/is revolutionary, influential, and often very beautiful. It seems like the world loses something by excluding it. So it made me think: how far do we go in drawing the line? If it just means switching to a different brand of chocolate bar, it’s no big deal. And at the other extreme, if the \*only\* doctor who could save your life had been instrumental in a genocide, you still probably wouldn’t refuse their services. But what about the in-between cases?
