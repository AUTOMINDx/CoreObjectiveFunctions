Karen attacks a cosplayer
So last year, before COVID really hit, I was really into cosplays. This story takes place early 2020, at PAX South. I was there for the first time ever with my Aunt and cousin, I was there as Celestia Ludenburg (A character from a Semi-popular video game called Dangaronpa.) and my cousin was Mikan, (Character from Danganronpa too!) we had so much fun together through the day taking pictures with other cosplayers and playing video games.

A little bit before we had to leave a kid, about 9-ish at the time, ran up to me. She introduced her self as Callie, not her real name of course, and asked to take a picture with me. I said "Sorry kid but I'm about to leave and I'm super tired." The girl looked a bit sad but I had a compromise, "If you meet me at the Caf√© area tomorrow we can take a picture then!" She quickly perked up and ran off to a table not 30 feet from us. Soon I heard the call of a wild Karen.

**The devil has been released**

The woman stomped over to me and yells in my face, "Why won't you let my child take a picture with you!?" I backed up telling her I'm about to leave, and we can take a picture tomorrow. Oh boy that set her off as she started dragging me, "You WILL take a picture with my child RIGHT NOW!!" She huffed while dragging me, now I had heels on even though they hurt me and kicked her with one of then. She dramatically I assaulted her, "HLP HELP THIS HEATHEN ASSAULTED ME!!" She was fake crying and everything, I looked up to her child and she was red in the face most likely embarrassed.

A security guard came over and told the Karen she needed to leave, she pointed to me and yelled, "SHE ASSAULTED MEEEEEE I WANT TO HAVE HER ARRESTED" I just stared at her, no words, jus staring. Sensing that no one believed her she jumped at me, calling me a R-word, a bitch, and an asshole. I couldn't even fight back as the dress was heavy.

I felt her get off of me just for her to ***JUMP ON MY LEG. crack.*** Everyone who was watching heard. Now i wasn't crying because I was in shock. "How do you like THAT you bitch?!" science. you could hear a pin drop. "YOU BITCH!! HOW DARE YOU HURT ME OVER A DAMN PICTURE. I"M GOING TO FUCKING SUE YOU!" I yelled at her. Finally my aunt came and saw me on the floor, and the Karen looking flabbergasted. I swear my aunt was going to murder the lady but held back because of the guard. The guard then put cuffs on the lady and called back up and an ambulance, "Ma'am you are under arrest for assaulting a minor." She screamed as she was taken away and the kids dad had to pick her up.

Now I don't remember much and a lot details are missing and I'm choosing to forget in. I'm going back next year and hope I see the kid again NOT her mom though.

You can ask in the comments if you want to know extra details ill try to remember

Edit: Ah yes here we go the lawsuit! I know many of you waited for this and I'm sorry for making you wait.

As soon as my mother found about what happened, she was livid and immediately sued Karen. Karen sued back with "Emotional Abuse". In March is when we finally went to court and the little girl and her father were there. The father apologized on behalf of  that woman. He told me he filed for divorce as well! I don't know how that went but I hope he got full custody. Anyway - When Karen saw mw at court she gave me a stink eye, like a really bad one. She was muttering under breath probably called me profanities or something I didn't care.

The court case was quick as well - a week - as no one wanted to put up with Karen's bs. She accused me of emotionally abuse her for yelling at her that I would sue and that we should pay her 10K USD. WHAT?!

EM: This girl, I'm non-binary btw, should pay me 10k dollars because my self esteem was broken because I'm never denied what I want. She should've just taken a picture with my child then none of this wouldn't have happened.

That's pretty much what she said. I just GLARED at her as if the did break my leg and tried to drag me over a picture. I was called up to the stand as to talk about what happened.

Me: Your Honor. Ms. Karen here tried to force me to take a picture with her child even though I've already given a compromise. The guard was there and saw everything. Ask him.

Karen looked smug, like she thought she would win the case.

the guard gave his statement and also said the have cameras. Karen's face drained. bingo. She tried to stop the case saying she won't sue us for the "emotional abuse" if we don't show the video. Ha no we counter sued for 15k and I wanted justice.

The video showed showing Karen was in the wrong.

Judge: Ms. Karen you are charred with Assault of a minor.

She was given about 2 months jail time and community services. I got 15k and justice.

Hi guys sorry if this short I am very uncomfortable with going into details but my summary is pretty much what happened.

Edit 2: So I found out PAX won't be back next year! I'm pretty sad about it but I'm looking into going to other conventions
