Would abortion be as traumatic if women were not shamed for having this procedure?
I donâ€™t want to come off as insensitive. I am a woman but have not experienced pregnancy or abortion. From my perspective, it appears that a lot of the trauma surrounding abortion comes from the patriarchal shame and stigma surrounding it.

I certainly can understand that the procedure is not necessarily pleasant, and there are many woman who may have conflicting feelings about wanting to keep the child. Anyone can have trauma from anything, and I absolutely want to listen to women talk about their experiences with abortion. 

If the patriarchy were abolished (the shame and stigma of abortion is gone, doctors listen to female patients concerns, bodily autonomy is promoted), would a large amount of woman would continue to experience and view abortions as upsetting and traumatic? Or would it generally be viewed as any other medical procedure?
