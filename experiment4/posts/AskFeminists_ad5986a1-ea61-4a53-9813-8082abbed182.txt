Does the evidence support that we live in a white male patriarchy?
**Patriarchy** 

* Men run 174 out of 195 countries https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures

* Men run 81% of all companies https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/how-many-companies-are-run-women-and-why-does-it-matter-0

* Men are 73% of all STEM workers https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/women-making-gains-in-stem-occupations-but-still-underrepresented.html

* Women make just 77% of what men do on average https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/csw61/equal-pay

* Only SIX countries worldwide give women full legal and economic equality with men https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/01/only-six-countries-in-the-world-give-women-and-men-equal-legal-rights

**White Dominance** 

As of 2021, 78% of the world’s population lives on less than the equivalent to $20 a day (that’s $20 of U.S. purchasing power, not $20 converted into whatever currency) https://ourworldindata.org/higher-poverty-global-line

That includes: https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/03/The-global-inc-distribution-190-10-30-1536x959.png

* virtually all living in Black areas 

* virtually all living in Brown (Middle East, India) areas 

* most living in Asian areas 

* most living in Hispanic/Mestizo areas

Which leaves us down to the High-Income Country section, comprised of 28 nations listed in a blurb down at the bottom of the page. Breaking them down individually, we find that the white populations of these countries are as follows:

1. Australia - 78% 
2. Austria - 91% 
3. Belgium - 91% 
4. Canada - 73% 
5. Cyprus - 80% 
6. Denmark - 94% 
7. Finland - 97% 
8. Germany - 88% 
9. France - 87% 
10. Iceland - 98% 
11. Ireland - 93% 
12. Greece - 92% 
13. Italy - 95% 
14. Norway - 94% 
15. Portugal - 98% 
16. Spain - 90% 
17. Sweden - 90% 
18. Switzerland - 95% 
19. Luxembourg - 93% 
20. Malta - 95% 
21. Netherlands - 85% 
22. U.K. - 86% 
23. U.S. - 76% (taken from the official 2021 Census report - https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219. Some in the country like to differentiate between non-Latino whites and Latino whites but this counts all whites)
24. U.A.E - 6% 
25. Taiwan - 0.1% 
26. Japan - 0.3% 
27. South Korea - 0.4% 
28. Israel - unclear 

When you take the mean of the 27 that enough clear data exists for, you get an average white population of 76% across those countries. The average of the first 23 is 89%. 

**Conclusion** 

So men globally run almost everything, are the overwhelming majority of those with significant wealth, dominate the big paying &amp; big prestige job fields and still have legal supremacy to women in most countries. At the same time, the vast majority of the population in almost all high income countries is white. And what’s the ultimate intersection between that and the previously described male dominance in our society? The answer is *white men*.

**Question**

So what do y’all think? Does this prove that we live in a white and male dominated world? Should other statistics be taken into account when discussing the topic? And what are some of the things that you think can be done to address any of these gaps, whether it be from a gender equality standpoint or a first world vs second/third world wealth standpoint? 

**TL:DR** - men run almost everything in our society, are the vast majority of people with major wealth, dominate the high paying job fields and have legal supremacy to women in most countries. At the same time, the overwhelming majority of the population in almost all high income countries is white, and the ultimate intersection between that and general male dominance is White Men. To what extent does this prove that the world is a white male patriarchy?
