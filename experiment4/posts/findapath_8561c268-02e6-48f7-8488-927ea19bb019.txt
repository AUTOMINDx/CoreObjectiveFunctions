Anyone here gone from lawyer to therapist successfully?
Hi all, late 20s attorney here. Have been practicing just over 2 years. I picked a practice area that meant a lot to me ideologically and have enjoyed my clients generally, but have come to really be disillusioned the constant deadlines, fights, and overall nature of law. Like probably many others before me, I picked this field because at the time I thought it was the best way to make a difference. 

And, I have done well so far based on feedback from mentors, but I really do not derive a lot of satisfaction from writing briefs or doing discovery. It doesn't typically feel like I am making a significant difference in anything, and I feel like litigation often takes years to pay off, if it ever does. I am starting to think that being a lawyer is not how I want to spend my life.

I am a people person who naturally tends to build rapport with others. This makes me great with clients but frustrated by needing to deal with opposing counsel. I also hate reviewing documents in discovery and kind of can't feature that I'll be doing that for years.

I am thinking of pursuing therapy because it seems like a way to have more meaningful relationships with clients, it makes use of my collaborative and relational nature. I am looking into master's programs currently and want to see if there's anyone out there who has made a similar switch to me that would be willing to share the good/bad/ugly. Could anyone share their experiences transitioning into psychotherapy?

I am sure I will edit to add info but that's all I can think of. Thanks for any help and insight.
