I feel like deep inside, I enjoy being a depressed mess and I enjoy feeling inferior to everyone else
So I have trouble doing anything, no matter how hard I try to beat this fucking shit called my stupid mind. I am so fucking tired of trying. I just wanna die. I see no progress and will never see it because a huge part of me LOVES feeling like this and I just dont wanna admit that. I enjoy feeling inferior to other guys, feeling weak and terrible because I'm gay and I was raised around women (single mother, older sisters)  so I developed a weird obsession with other guys and I feel like I want to be the weak piece of shit that needs to be saved by a strong big muscular man..I have terrible fetishes that fulfill the idea of me being so inferior, worthless and small compared to them, at least that's how fucked up my mind is. I have a kink for being a fucking victim and I hate myself so much for it. I wanna stab myself to death and torture myself to death cause that's what I am, a fucking victim but no one will ever save me cause I hate my fucking self.
