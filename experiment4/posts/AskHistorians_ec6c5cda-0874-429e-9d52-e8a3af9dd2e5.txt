Throughout the Roman Empire, “Augustus” was generally the senior title, while “Caesar” alone was generally reserved for junior emperors. Why did Caesar end up getting adopted into so many European monarchy titles (ie Kaiser, Tsar), rather than Augustus?
I tend to think of Caesar alone as one of the junior emperors in Diocletian’s tetrarchy or the title given to the emperor’s son as presumptive heir. Why didn’t the Russians, Germans, etc name their Monarchs “Augustus” rather than “Caesar”? Wouldn’t you want the biggest, baddest title around?
