What sort of "energy returns," have hunter-gatherer and premodern agricultural peoples been able to get for their hunting, gathering, and farming work?
[A study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12395862/) of The Highlanders of Papua New Guinea showed that their gardening efforts returned between ten and fifteen times the energy expended in cultivation. Raising pigs returned four to five times the energy invested in rearing them. But foraging was energetically costly, with foragers expending four times more energy than it brought in.

I'm trying to put this into context. Are these usually bad returns? Do the Papua New Guinea highlands offer unusually poor gathering conditions? 

What is a "normal," energy return for premodern farming and animal husbandry? What about gathering?

Or what sort of range would we see in a survey of different societies?
