Can't hold conversations? Maybe you don't care enough
We've all heard of the advice **"be genuinely interested in others"**. But it's a bit more than asking people 50 different questions and letting them talk about themselves.     

[Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/raq0rx/and_you_wonder_why_your_conversation_lasts_only/) to see an example of being interested in others


Some say but I don't find the topic interesting. **What's the problem with being genuinely interested in others and with listening beyond the spoken words?**

 **It takes effort.**

 It takes effort to listen beyond the surface level.

It takes effort to be interested in, ask a question, and listen to something you aren't familiar with

Most importantly, **it takes care**.
***
If you don't care, you will feel like you're feigning interest because the effort feels forced rather than genuine. 

So if you find yourself **struggling to care and be interested in them, ask yourself why are you having a conversation with this person?** (here're some examples)
        
* If you want to learn more about them, you're interested and care to understand what interests them. 
+ If you want to see if you and the person are a good fit for a further relationship, you're interested to explore more about them (And yes there's a possibility that by the end of the chat, you may find out you just aren't interested in what they're interested in. And perhaps it's time to move on. That's okay. it's part of life. Spend your effort on someone else)
+ If you want to build a stronger connection with people, it takes effort to learn more about them and it takes genuine care/interest.
+ If you want to have a great conversation, ask yourself are you expecting the other person to care and put in the effort to be interested in you, and you don't want to do the same? (for now, let's skip the topic where you put in the effort and the others don't in this post)

**Everything important in life takes effort**. When the tough time comes around where it feels tough to put in the effort (imagine after 10 mins running on the treadmill, **it's so easy to give up). Your purpose is the only thing that will keep you going** despite the challenge and uncomfortability.

**Be clear with yourself on what's your purpose** :)

Once you found your purpose, [give a great conversation](https://www.eloquency.co) by talking and sharing more about yourself. Listen for the hidden messages and respond to them by asking relevant questions. It all starts with care.
