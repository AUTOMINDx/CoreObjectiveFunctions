Always feeling like I messed up after hanging out with people
I never really had friends growing up and didn’t do much socializing in general. In the past year I started making friends, but it’s stressful because as soon as I settle in after they leave I’m convinced I fucked up somehow and they hate me. Especially on days I start oversharing on trauma or literally anything going on in my life, which I do when I’m nervous and the more I do it the more panicked I feel. I say some stupid things and can’t stop thinking about it, I’m still stuck on embarrassing things I said in like january. 

Sometimes when I think about it too much I plan on ignoring everyone and dropping them. I’m so scared of being the one abandoned or being hated for being annoying that I just want to flee. Anytime they hang out without me it feels like a confirmation that I’m a burden. When I’m set on leaving I also delete my social media and hide away to try to cut ties. I feel awful about it too because I don’t want to be guilt trippy at all.  I overreact about everything unintentionally. 

It is a bit worse this time because it was my one friends birthday so I drank and talked to more people. Stayed up until 5am socializing and feel like a fool. Not as much towards my normal friend group but in general and I want to drop off of the earth so badly.
