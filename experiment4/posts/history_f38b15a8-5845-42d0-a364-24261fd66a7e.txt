What significant differences were there if any, between WW1 trenches and WW2 trenches?
Were there any differences in how they were made and used? This is a question I’ve always pondered because it seems like there should be logical variables to trench designs that are significantly impacted by the wars frontline progress, but I just haven’t seen anything specific. 

Did the constant frontline movement in WW2 compared to the more static WW1 actually impact how trenches were made and used?
