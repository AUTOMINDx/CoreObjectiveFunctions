[The Expanse] Do all ring gates look alike?
In reading the final book and its exploration of the protomolecule masters, I got to thinking. Each gate hijacks a unique local ecosystem, in Sol, the 1.5 million people of Eros are repurposed to build the gate. The footage from Eros made it clear that they weren't just deconstructed, but rather their functional parts were used - hands crawled, Julie Mao maintained some control, Miller's mind kept searching.

So, does the Sol gate still have human features? (Or did the developments on Venus remove most recognisable features? We know Miller outlasted those, but he was in the protomolecule aboard the _Roci_.)

If our gate does have human features, what about the other gates? Does Laconia gate have some vestigial elements of the biosphere that was used to create it? Are there gates that continue to writhe with bug legs or tentacles?
