Do you ever have a hard time not "rescuing" your parent?
If you do spend a lot of time rescuing your parent(s), then you know what I mean... 

I joined this sub about 3 months ago, and its been so eye-opening for me. One comment in particular hit me really hard - we have the option NOT to rescue our parent from their own mistakes. We don't have to ____ for them (whatever it is we always do). Most of the things we do in relation to our parent is a choice... 

And now, just damnit, that thought keeps rattling around in my head. Still talk to both of my parents (both alcoholics, one is also a huge pot head, the other one has periodic depression). I just have such a hard time drawing boundaries. Like what would my dad do if he had to deal with mom by himself? Who would mom talk to when she gets depressed or (worse) paranoid? How would I know if they're ok..? 

Y'know? Does anyone else still talk to their parent every week or so? Do you ever daydream about all the what ifs, were you to stop saving them from themselves..? 

And if you don't communicate on the regular - how did you go about setting those boundaries?
