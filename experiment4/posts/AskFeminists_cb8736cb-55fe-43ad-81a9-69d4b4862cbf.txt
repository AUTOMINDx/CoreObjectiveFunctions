Should 'rape by deception' be made illegal? Or considered sexual exploitation?
I had posted about how there are countries that do consider sex by deception as rape. They consider the consent as void when it was uninformed consent. 

Example: lying about STD, Marital status, wearing a condom, promises of marriage when marriage is the condition for consent, religious beliefs etc. They are all considered sexual deceit. 

I am of the belief that it infringes the autonomy of the person to their body when consent is fraudulently induced when the perpetrator was aware of the condition of consent and deliberately deceived their partner. And this can cause emotional, physical and mental damages to the person

(A request to not use victim blaming language when discussing)

Edit: I also don't get why people are mad at me for consent by deception being illegal in some countries? It is.. I am not the decision making body for it. Nowhere close. 

Okayy..you disagree with me or the law.. but I don't understand how this is a personal issue with me tho?please be mindful of the fact this is not a personal argument. We are just respectfully discussing.
