How do others handle management trying to shortcut proper engineering process resulting in bad work?
I am a senior engineer and tech lees for a business line in my company. The company I did work for was baught by my current company. The new management, program managers, pretty much everyone are old, non engineers. Most of which have only been in the engineering industry for 5-10 years, before most were gov employees.

I have 25 years of engineering experience including a doctorate of science in engineering. I know how to build a product from start to finish. However I'm being told constantly to skip steps, don't bother with documentation, and more.

Now they are trying to go around me to my engineering team of 20 people to get some of them to bypass my decisions.

I have debts, a family and probably can't leave the job for at least another year for somthing else. I am very well paid for where I live. Interestingly enough, when they bumped my pay this year for being awarded so many patents last year, is when they started really bothering me. To be clear, I did not ask for the raise.
