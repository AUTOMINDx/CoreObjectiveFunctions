What are your opinions on the whole “friends with benefits” concept? Would you lose respect for a friend if she wanted to suck your dick but not date you?
Wow thanks for all the input! For backstory, I am female. I haven’t had sex in years, but I’m also focused on my career and home life and I really don’t want a relationship right now. I just think I want a friend I trust enough to be intimate with. However after reading these stories it seems feelings usually develop one way or the other so now I think I’ll stick to my toys 😂
