What is wrong with me :(
&amp;#x200B;

Im 22f, grew up in a really secretly abusive household where my father used to do things to me and this past summer a guy I met (hes 30) raped me in his house, on my 22nd b-day, I was bleeding so much and frozen in pain. I'm a premedical student, a senior in college, I work on a mental health unit in the hospital. I'm also an EMT. I can't really express how consistently every day for hours I'm triggered by my own job/school/etc, I feel like im punishing myself by reading through other ppls stories, I always find people whove been hurt and it triggers me even more. Especially because I feel so deeply inadequate and stupid in comparison. I was alone in the hospital after it happened, for 6 hours. If that doesnt tell me I should be killing myself as soon as I muster the courage I dont know what will. I was supposed to apply to med school this coming May but I don't know, I don't even want to anymore, its a recipe for disaster, but I probably still will because I hate myself too much to let another opportunity for endless pain to be surpassed. Whats wrong with me :(
