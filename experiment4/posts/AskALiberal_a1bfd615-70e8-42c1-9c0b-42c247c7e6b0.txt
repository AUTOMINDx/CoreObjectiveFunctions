Would you move to another country, either temporarily or permanently? Under what circumstances, and to what country? Would the political or economic environment of the US affect that decision?
This question is geared toward US Redditors, but I’m interested in other peoples answers too. 

Things that prompted me to ask:

-I’ve seen more than one meme and Twitter screenshots about “the American dream being to move to another country” (this is usually in r/antiwork or Twitter subreddits). I wonder how many of y’all feel this way. 

-One of my high school teachers (many years ago) wanted to move to Germany because she worried about her kids going to school in the US considering mass shootings. 

-Younger Americans (and it would seem many of us on this subreddit) feel the US is in danger of slipping into an autocracy or civil war.

Edit: thank you everyone for interesting answers. I wanted to apologize for asking a question that has been asked a lot, as some of y’all pointed out. I know a better way to search thanks to u/redyellowblue5031
