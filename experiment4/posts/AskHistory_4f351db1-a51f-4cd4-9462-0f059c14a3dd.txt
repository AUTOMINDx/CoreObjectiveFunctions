Making a worst former world leaders iceberg chart. Am I missing anyone from this list?
Before I reveal what the iceberg looks like so far, I'd like to explain the qualifications that the chart follows: 

\- The leader is a war criminal 

\- The leader embezzled money from their own government 

\- The leader killed a lot of people 

\- The leader had a famine in their country and did nothing about it 

\- Or the leader sunk the economy 

Also, if you disagree with a placement on the chart, please tell me. Anyways, lets get into the iceberg

 Tier 1: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao Zedong, Kim Jong-il, and Saddam Hussein ( Needs 2 more entries )

 Tier 2: Idi Amin, Hideki Tojo, and Kim Il-sung ( Needs 5 more entries )

 Tier 3: Ion Antonescu and Mobutu Sese Seko ( Needs 6 more entries )

 Tier 4: Hugo Chavez, Ferdinand Marcos, Omar al-Bashir, and Yahya Khan ( Needs 4 more entries )

 Tier 5: Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, Charles Taylor, and Saparmurat Niyazov ( Needs 5 more entries ) 

Tier 6: Efrain Rios Montt and Jorge Rafael Videla ( Needs 6 more entries )

Tier 7: Hissene Habre ( Needs 7 more entries ) 

Tier 8: ( Needs 8 more entries ) 

If you submit a leader that will be used in the iceberg, you can choose if you want credit or not.
