I just asked a girl out.
I just asked a girl out for coffee a few minutes ago. I’m currently waiting on a reply and it’s seriously nerve-wracking right now but I also feel like I’ve just made a huge breakthrough with my anxiety issues. 

Wish me luck!

Update: I asked her out for coffee while she was already out with friends and she said another time. I don’t know if that means rejection or not but you know what? I’m completely fine and now I won’t have regrets later on in life for not asking. This is a good feeling.
