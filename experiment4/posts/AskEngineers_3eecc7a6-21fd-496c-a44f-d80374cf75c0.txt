What do you do when you start to lose steam on the daily grind?
I'm 2.5 years out of university with a pretty comfortable position in mechanical engineering at a medium sized private company.  As a new engineer, I've been lucky enough to rotate around the company in a few different areas - mechanical design, electronics packaging, and manufacturing.

Even with the variety of work, I just really have been feeling like I've been running out of steam lately.  I worked way too hard my first 1.5 years at the company and got burnt out, and this past year I've been taking it easy with my hours.  Even when taking it easy, though, I just dont find much excitment in a lot of my projects recently.

It's weird because I LOVED university.  I considered myself lucky everyday that I went into an insanely cool field with so much potential to earn different skills everyday.  Now I'm right where I always wanted to be, but have no drive to do so.

What do you do when you start to lose steam and passion for your work?  Is there a way you try to get to the root cause (need for a career change, company change, etc.)?  It sucks kinda just going into the office with no intent of trying to better myself or enjoy my work.
