Why are ravishment fantasies popular? Experienced man/virginal woman? Unhealthy power dynamics?
Hello!

Something that I've always wondered about the romance novel genre is the popularity of bodice rippers and ravishment fantasies. Many times, these kinds of books are written by women for women, but they feature many sexist tropes such as the experienced man/virginal woman, unhealthy or toxic power dynamics. I enjoy these myself but at the same time, the feminist in me is shaking her head. Would I ever date a guy like this? No way! Are the stories hot? You betcha.

Does anyone have any insight as to why, psychologically speaking, sexist tropes are so compelling? Bonus points if you have sources to back up your opinion! This topic has interested me for a long time!

Thank you.

Edit:  FWIW I searched the subreddit for 'ravishment fantasies' and only saw a question from 8 years ago that was more about comparing men and women. If this is a recurring question, if you could point me to some helpful answers that would be great but I didn't see it by searching the subreddit.
