Is it possible to heal from emotionally unavailable caregivers if the nature of therapy just seems to recreate that dynamic?
Apologies in advance, this may be more of a vent than a question.  As the title says, I’ve come to understand that a big part of my fucked up brain (years of eating disorders, depression, avoidance of relationships, agoraphobia, etc) could have been caused by the wounds resulting from my parents’ inability to be emotionally present and connected with me.  I’ve been in different types of therapy over the years, and it has always ended with more hopelessness and increased my fears/avoidance of relationships and of life in general.  Won’t the nature of the therapeutic relationship always be unsatisfying, like my relationship with my parents was?  Like a therapist with good boundaries will always be unavailable to an extent and sort of detached.  I feel like it’s just cruel and re-traumatizing.  Is it ever the case that therapy is the wrong medicine?  Real life relationships aren’t feasible either- I have never been able to feel close to anyone.  And my mental health has been so shit that I would not make a good friend or partner.  Is it just a matter of accepting that I’m not capable of emotional intimacy and connection?  I’m afraid if I keep trying and failing that the hopelessness will get to be too much.  I’m just at a loss.  Thanks for reading this far.
