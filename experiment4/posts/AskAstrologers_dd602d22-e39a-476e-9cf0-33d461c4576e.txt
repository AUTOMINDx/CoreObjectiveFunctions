Venus retrograde hasn’t started yet but how y’all holding up what’s happening currently to set the tone ??
My Venus Retrograde pre experience or likely experience is it’s emo hours missing old crushes and also getting deep in the feels and feeling somewhat nostalgic for a future that could be possible but who knows it’s supposed to be in my 4th house but that can mean many different things 4th house topics for me is the desire to reconnect with the things and the people that make me feel secure and at “home “ that seems pretty 4th house to me so this will be interesting how this transit plays out until March so how about everyone else what are you seeing currently ??
