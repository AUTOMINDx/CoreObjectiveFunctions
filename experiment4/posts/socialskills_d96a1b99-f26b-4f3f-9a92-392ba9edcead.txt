My conversational skills end at asking "how are you doing?"
I just always feel like my conversations are terribly forced and I can't say anything interesting about stuff I like (mainly because I'm not really good at my own hobbies and voicing any opinions). I'm terribly quiet and if I talk, I mostly end up talking about most generic topics in the most boring way possible. Because of it I don't really try talking or writing to people. Meanwhile everyday I meet amazing, smart and funny people and I love questions they ask, jokes they make. I admire them so much, some of them seem like half-gods at least, with witty remarks and bright ideas in every situations, but I feel like I'm so behind them. I would love to have deeper connections with people, but I know I have to talk more to do so. 


So any tips on how to go from boring to best person anybody has every talk to, due yesterday?
