EM thinks classic cars are public property
If you have a classic car you know what I mean. 

We had a small classic car dealership for a few years and the entitled parents were plentiful.  One of my favorites was an EM who was getting some tires at the shop next door told my husband (H) it was her daughter’s 16th birthday and could she take some pictures with our 41 Plymouth.  He says sure, why not. 


About an hour later EM comes back and starts to give H directions to her house, which happened to be about 30 miles away.

H: Why do I need to know where you live?

EM: So you know where to bring the car this afternoon. 

H: I said you could take pictures, I never said I would bring it to your house. Just bring your daughter here.

EM: It’s my daughter’s birthday. You’re not a man of your word. 

H: I don’t care about your daughter and I didn’t promise, but whatever. I guess I lied. 

Some more fussing, but it wasn’t happening. 

So many stories. Come out here and unlock all the cars so my son can sit in them.
No thank you. 

Little Johnny wanted to stand on the hoods. And you have to let him because he’s mY bABy!!
