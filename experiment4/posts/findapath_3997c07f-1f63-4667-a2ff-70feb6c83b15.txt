I made the worst decision of my life studying psychology
I honestly never wanted to go to college and my mom and ex boyfriend kept convincing me telling me it was a necessity in life and that i wasn’t going to have a stable job without it. I was told any degree would lead to a good job and now i see how stupid that sounds. I’m 4 classes away from graduating and the only thing i want to do is drop out. I had a plan of going to law school but only 30% of people in my country pass the bar exam and you only have 6 tries. I just want to drop out and change to finance which will actually get me a job, but my family keeps forcing me to finish. I feel lied to and more depressed than i’ve ever been in my life. Turns out you need at least a masters for a career in psychology since it’s not the 60s anymore and any degree won’t get you a job. All i do now is cry every night and think about what a failure i am every day since the moment i wake up. All i want is to drop out i feel like that degree would just be a constant reminder of all the time and money wasted on something that won’t get me a job. I honestly think liberal arts degrees shouldn’t even legally be sold. I mean studying what you love is capitalist bullshit that lands you either spending lots of money or going into debt for something that won’t land you a job. All I do is cry and compare myself to people I studied with I really don’t want to finish this degree but my family is forcing me to finish it.
