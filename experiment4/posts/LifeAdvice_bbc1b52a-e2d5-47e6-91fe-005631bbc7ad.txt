I am 18 and I still like fighting imaginary enemies
I have always been a somewhat introverted kid with an overactive imagination and I liked superhero shows so it was almost inevitable that I had an entire imaginary super hero life as a kid. I thought as I got older I would gradually get over it but I never did. I turned 18 last week and I still insert myself in any game or movie world I can and start punching air. Is this behavior normal? How do I stop it? I am too embarrassed to ask this anywhere else
