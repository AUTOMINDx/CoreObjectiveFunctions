Update on my post about founding out my [26M] girlfriend [25F] cheated on me behind my back
So I lost access to my original account and can't find my original post (which was a week ago) but to recap, me and my girlfriend had been together for 3 years and I thought they were great. However, I learned the harsh truth when i discovered messages on her cell phone (when she left her cellphone at home and was going to bring it to work) between her and a coworker confirming they were at least emotionally cheating if not physical.

I decided to confront her after taking advice and she got angry at me for looking at her phone. I again asked her to ask me about the text message and she refuses. I told her she had 2 weeks to get her stuff out (only my name was on the lease) and she went into physically attacking me with threats to kill me. I had to lock myself in a room and call the cops (who arrested her).

I am pressing charges for her assaulting me and am currently staying at my brother's house while she is taking her stuff back. I want to thank you all for this great advice and realizing it was a bullet dodged.
