Feelings of being emotionally repressed
It's like a choice except the need or habit of pushing my emotions down is "strong" but I recently took mushrooms which have helped. Has anyone felt like all there painful emotions and maybe good ones were locked in their chest and then when they were activated by a trigger where it felt it like your emotions were in a ball lodged there but then suddenly came out with a tremendous force but then back to being repressed and feeling like it's too easy to hold them down but it seems so weird because the experience was so strong? I have this and I'm trying to loosen them with meditation, but it's hard.

Edit: thank you all for the support and advice it helps
