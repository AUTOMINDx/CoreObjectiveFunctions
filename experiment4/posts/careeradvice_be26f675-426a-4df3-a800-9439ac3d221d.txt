My wife keeps getting to the final round, but no job
My wife has made it to the final round now for 4 positions, each of which she has wanted badly. I keep telling her that once you're in the final round, usually all the candidates are equally qualified, and it's just about overall fit with the team, as opposed to qualifications. 

But her takeaway is, "People invite me to interview, but then when they meet me, they decide they don't want me." I respond that since she's getting past the first round, it can't be that they're not liking her. She does have some aspects to her that are a little awkward (lacking bits of tacitly understood culture here and there), she doesn't always "get it," but having seen her at work in her current job (she works from home), when I overhear her in meetings, even with strangers, it doesn't seem to create any awkwardness.

But I also don't really know what is going on, and it has been really demoralizing because the positions she's been applying for (in higher education and at nonprofits) have actually had really demanding application processes.

Can anyone offer advice about what they think is going on here?
