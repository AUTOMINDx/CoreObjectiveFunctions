Parents threaten to report me missing if I don’t answer
Long story short, I’ve been attempting NC with my extended family and parents. Last night, I got a voicemail from my dad saying if I don’t call by tomorrow (today). They’ll report me missing and report my car stolen, they own the title to it. So I knew I needed to drop it off. I dropped it off in their driveway and left the key in the mailbox. 

I thought I blocked all their contacts but my mom’s iMessage from her email came through and I got a message saying,

I guess we’ll have to report you missing. Who knows Colin did something to you. Why can’t you just be honest and tell us what’s going on? Or even text.

Do I call the police and explain the situation in case they do escalate to that option? 

Also who threatens their adult child like that? Mind you I’m 27 with a stable job where I’ve been getting a lot of praise and credit and been in therapy consistently since June. My life’s been great. Nothings wrong, it’s just time to no longer keep them in my life anymore, not like they’ve been there in the first place.
