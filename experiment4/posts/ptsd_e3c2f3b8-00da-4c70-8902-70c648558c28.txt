Anyone else have this injury? How do you cope?
This is a bit icky, so I'm sorry, and please skip if you need to. It's taken me a long time to decide to open up about this so please don't make fun of me :(

I have chronic anal fissures from repeated anal rape. They are painful, constantly open up, and I have an ugly "sentinel tag" (basically a scar that protrudes) that gets in the way when I use the bathroom.

My doctor has said I will likely need to be on stool softeners for the rest of my life thanks to the risk of reinjury. But no matter what I do, if I push a little too hard or get a little constipated, I'm guaranteed a week or more of excruciating pain. They're like hemorrhoids on steroids. And forget about pregnancy-- I'm pretty much guaranteed a perineal tear if I give birth since the muscle wall has been wounded and repaired so many times.

I'm dealing with a flare right now and all I want to do is sit on the floor and sob. They're a lifetime reminder of the shit I've gone through and they're never going away. My abuser has permanently destroyed that part of my body. I hate it so much. I feel disgusting.

Anyone else have to deal with this? Should I try and get stronger painkillers for flares or would that be a slippery slope? How do you handle the shame that comes with this kind of injury? Are there remedies you take to prevent them opening up over and over? Miralax only does so much, but that's all my doctor said to do. I was on steroids once for a particularly bad tear but I hated it and it didn't make them heal much faster.
