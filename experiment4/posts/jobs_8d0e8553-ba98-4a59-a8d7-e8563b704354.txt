I’m exhausted by other peoples expectation of me and how they think there are SO many places hiring.
People who haven’t even been in the job market or actually applied to a job in the last ten years love to tell me, how “I should be able to find a $60-$75k job, no problem! I just finished my degree, no problem!”

Well as someone who has been deep in the job postings and reading their requirements, redoing her resume whenever the job requires a little bit more of this or that and writing letters of interest, cover letters, cv’s to match jobs even willing to pay over $40k in a much smaller market, seriously shut up!!!!!!!

I have always been able to find good jobs but this is the next level in my professionalism, and it’s gonna be harder than it was before, but why everyone has to tell me that I must be doing something wrong or have no idea of what i want or what I’m doing is sooo frustrating.

Not only am I stressed out by not having job, I just can’t take jobs that would ruin the quality of my resume. I studied Organizational Leadership and read books and data about the change in corporations and leader over the past few decades since the 80’s.

But you know all the news channels and low paying retailers got all the hiring now signs, so I must be doing something wrong or going through some terrible turnpikes thing where I like to sit around all day and do nothing, even though I’m pretty much take care of things around here, that no one else is! 

I’m just without any support, and no one gets that yes in times of your career what the next step is can be clear and it can happen. But just coming out of school trying to transition out of heavy retail background isn’t just cake! It’s a change of industry and you have to have companies willing to take the bet on you that your experiences parallels what they need in another industry. 


Anyways, but screw any word that comes out of my mouth, cause MSNBC, CNN, FOX said THERE ARE SO MANY JOBS!!!
