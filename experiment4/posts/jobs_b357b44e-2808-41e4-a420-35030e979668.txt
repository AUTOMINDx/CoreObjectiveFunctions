Got my first full time job and I can’t do this another month let alone the rest of my life.
I got a full time job working nightshift at a supermarket thinking it would be a good way to save up money right out of high school. I’m making a lot of money and exceeding my savings goals but I feel like I’ve sold my soul. I just don’t get how people can work 40+ hours a week. They say find a job you like and it’ll be easier but that’s total bullshit. Honestly the job isn’t that bad and I don’t mind the work, but 40 hours of anything will drive me insane. I have no room for anything outside of work besides sleep and recovering. Working full time is literally making me suicidal. Call me lazy I really don’t care, but I’m not working another full time job ever. Full time work isn’t for me. At all. I seriously don’t want to live if that’s all there is to life.
