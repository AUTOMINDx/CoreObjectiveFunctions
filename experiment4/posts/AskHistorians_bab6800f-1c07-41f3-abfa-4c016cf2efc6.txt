Everything I've read about sieges of castles has said that once the walls were breached, defeat was inevitable. Were any sieges defeated at a castle's secondary defensive positions?
I've read a few answers about sieges on the sub, and they're always fantastic! Something I've noted is that every answer has said that a breach of the walls meant sure defeat, but also mention the besieged party preparing secondary defensive positions inside the walls to continue the defense. Did these ever work?
