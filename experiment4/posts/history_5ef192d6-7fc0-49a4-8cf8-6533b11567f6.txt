Is the Swedish royal family, Bernadotte, related to the house of Vasa?
I know of most major Swedish lines of succession, but one line that bothers me is the house of Bernadotte. Not because it was “adopted” into Swedish royalty, but rather because I am unsure whether or not the family is linked by blood to the house of Vasa. I know there is a connection between Bernadotte and the house of Glöcksburg via princess Ingrid, mother to the queen of Denmark, but my knowledge of Danish royalty stops there. I’ve tried googling it but the information in English is far too complicated for my vocabulary, I don’t understand Danish and the Swedish search results are mostly discussions on forums, which I don’t trust.

So I’ve come to you, masters of Reddit, in search of true knowledge. Is the Bernadotte family related by blood to the house of Vasa? It’s personal and very interesting to me.
