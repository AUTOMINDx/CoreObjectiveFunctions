No town squares outside the "west": why is that?
This only hit me when I was driving through Turkey's Cappadocia region: town after town **without  a single  town square**. We were driving and trying to find where  these towns center were located (we'd guess a town square), but we simply failed to find one. 

Even in Istanbul there are no really important squares -- like Taksim square is located in an important area, but it does not have the role of the of squares elsewhere in Europe or in the Americas. 

More examples: in Yogyakarta (city in Java, Muslim-majority Indonesian Island), people hang out in the sidewalks instead of squares, because there aren't any. Same for Japan: towns have parks, but no squares.

Does anyone know why there are no squares  outside the "west", as in the main place  where where town folks socialize?

Ancient Rome cities had a Forum, the area where people socialized and may be analogous to a town square. But Ancient Rome extended way over Turkey, where I could not find town squares.

It's really odd, because from Canada to Argentina, and in Europe, every small town has a square with a bar and church, and it's where people socialize.
