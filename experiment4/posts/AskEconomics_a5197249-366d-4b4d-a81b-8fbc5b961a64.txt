The US has a ~6% inflation, but the $ went up ?
Hi, me and my boyfriend have been stumped by this question, we don't know a LOT about economics so the answer might be really simple.
We both live in France, but he works for the US, and is paid a US salary in dollars. When he gets his salary in his account, the money is transfered to €. In recent months, his € salary has went up by 300€ approximately (but his salary in $ remains the same). I told him that was because we are currently suffering from a huge inflation spike right now, so the value of the € went down. But we recently learned that inflation in the US is actually worse than that of France right now, which is confusing because then you would think the dollar would have lost a ton of value, right ? And yet, the dollar is much more valuable than the euro right now. How is that possible, when inflation in the USA is around 6% and we are at around 4% in France ?

Thank you for anyone who takes the time to answer.
