What are some things you are missing, that you need, in order to "heal"?
For me I think its 

* having the ability to build small consistent victories. 

* A safe place to live, with the basic amenities like shower, toilet, fridge, etc.

* Connections that are meaningful and healthy with real in person people.

* Some income from a healthy non toxic job, I dont hate, that doesn't cross my boundaries. (Even better one with a living wage, that has meaning and value to me.)

* Hope in the future for myself, my country, and the planet.

If I had just those basic things. I could see myself making some real progress. How about you? What do you need?

Edit - Nearly every post here mentions money. Did you know if the top 5 richest Americans gave half their wealth to the poorest 10,000,000 Americans, each person would receive $41,050? Also that half the Americans that are of working age, make below $25,000 a year. Thats like $12 an hour or less for 100,000,000 people.
