How to heal when nothing works
Nothing helps. Therapy is a pointless money pit. They just want to push agendas on me and not listen. Even if they did I'm incapable of vocalizing the things that trouble me. I'm incapable of everything. Nothing works. Everything just makes it worse and worse. Digs this hole deeper and deeper. Every night I beg and plead with the universe to allow me to not wake up tomorrow because I'm too much of a coward to end it myself.

Nothing works. I just want to stop feeling like every day is the end of my life.

Edit: I regret asking and making all of you waste so much time throwing solutions at the fire. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...
