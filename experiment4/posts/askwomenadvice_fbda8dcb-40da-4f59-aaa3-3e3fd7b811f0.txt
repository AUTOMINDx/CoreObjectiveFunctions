I (34M) met a woman (35F) who I hit it off with incredibly, but her breath always smells terrible and I don't know how to tell her she has to get it resolved because I can't get close to her physically as it is always so bad. How should I go about telling her?
I told her once it smelled really bad. Actually, it was when we were about to hook up the first day we met. We were in my bed and I told her I just couldn't do it and she was sad and wanted to just leave and I told her to stay and we watched a little TV together. Her breath was so bad, though. 

The next time I saw her it was very bad, again. It smells like a medical issue, not just mouth issue. I don't know what to do. I can't get clsoe to her. I can't kiss her passionately like I really want to do. 

I feel so much love for this person, we text all the time, we adore each other, but her breath smells like shit, literally, and I have no clue how to tell her to get it resolved because I am getting really strong, serious feelings, but can't get close to her because of how bad her breath is. The negative attraction from her breath is getting in the way of our getting close.

What do I do and where do I even start?
