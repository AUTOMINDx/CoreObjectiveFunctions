Am I just too scared to put myself out there?
I barely have a social life. I have like one person I text and he’s getting tired of my shit and doesn’t even reply anymore. A few years ago I used to have plenty of friends but I threw all that away by being super influenced and drinking and smoking with them while driving my car and racking myself up two Duis within a years time when I was 19. Nearly 5 years later , I have bettered my life since, make good money, am in college, but don’t have friends. I am ready to start being social again and I want “homies.” I deleted my profile pic off Facebook and I conclude that I’m too scared to put myself out there. I think I’m scared of being open and vulnerable whilst being out there for everyone to see and judge and form opinions on me.  How do I get over my ego, I guess, and be more sociable and connect with people.
Also, I do have a full time job and am in school. I’m 23. I’m very busy and would only have time for friends on the weekends. I still want people to text and talk to during the week however. 
Is it okay to not have any friends?  If I spend my 20’s building my future and focusing on myself, will I still be able to make friends in my 30’s? Will it be harder to do so? Any serious advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks
