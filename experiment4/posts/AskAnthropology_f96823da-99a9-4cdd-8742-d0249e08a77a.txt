Air Filters for the King?
Back in the 90s i watched a couple of documentaries about some african tribes which are still monarchies/or have a King.  
One documentary was about Dahomey, and the then King Dah Agoli Agbo.  
He was wearing an "air filter" made from silver, over his nose, said to elevate him over his subjects, by him not having to breathe the same air as them.  
Another african ruler was shown to wear something similart, and as far as i understood it this was not some uncommon thing to do.  
I only remembered it after i read that the character "Immortan Joe" from the last Mad Max Movie was partially modeled around this idea, wearing a mask with an attached filter, to breath "better" air.

  
So i wonder if anthropologists have a a name for such a practice, and how well it was investigated so far?
