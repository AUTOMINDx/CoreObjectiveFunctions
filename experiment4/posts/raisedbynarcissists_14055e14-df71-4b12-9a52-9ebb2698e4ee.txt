When I was little, mother used to make fun of my paintings, and ask me that "aahahahah you really think people are gonna buy your paintings?" Many years later, I have sold over 40+ paintings worldwide.
I used to put my paintings on sale, and my mom used to laugh. She used to discourage me so much. After that, I stopped making art, and stopped doing everything. Years later, I'm now an artist, and a painter. Everyone in my life right now is VERY encouraging.

I have sold AROUND 40 (more or less) paintings to people who live in the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, and my country. It makes me happy because MY PAINTINGS exist in different countries, and on everyone's walls, and on the side table of their bed. 

I'm so glad that my partner pushed me into getting into art again. My mother definitely like(d) taking credit for everything I did good at. But I taught myself how to be better. Well, I don't practice at all, so I would say my talent(s) are God gifted.

My partner inspired me so much, and here I am, today. Really proud of myself.

Edit 1- I see everyone wants to see my paintings!! This means a lot to me, and I would love to link my art page/account, but for some reasons, I would like to keep its anonymity. I hope y'all will understand! I really want to ship DIRECTLY from my country to another, but I sent them through my relatives and clients, which is why, there are no extra charges for shipping. It costs a lot here to send stuff from my country to another (directly), and the process is quite a hassle. I cannot bear the expenses lol.

Edit 2 - THANK U SO MUCH FOR THE AWARD üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit 3 - I just woke up to so many kind comments, and AWARDS, omg!! THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE. Y'ALL MAKE ME FEEL LOVED, AND HAPPY. *SOBS*
