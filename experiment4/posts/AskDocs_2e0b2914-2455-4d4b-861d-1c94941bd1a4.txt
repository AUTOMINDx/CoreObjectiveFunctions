NSFW - Foreign body
I F42 recently had a pelvic MRI  for endometriosis. I've already had surgery for it back it 2017 so the MRI was just to see the extent. My report notes 'a foreign body noted - possibly an anal plug'. I'm really quite concerned about this as I don't own an anal plug and if I did, I certainly wouldn't wear it for a MRI. 

I've had two keyhole surgeries - one for endometriosis and another more recently for appendicitis. 

I'm a bit concerned and baffled. Could they have mixed my MRI up with someone else's? The rest of the report reads correctly.
