The finance department made a few mistakes in my pay stub.
Hello there!

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve accidentally discovered that the department of finance has made a few mistakes in my pay stub. I don’t know whether they are fatal or not. I’m not that strong in finance. But while the manager of the finance department is on her maternity leave. I suppose she has far more exciting things to do. Rather than provide me with a clear explanation, I’ve decided to ask here.

The issue is that I’ve recently applied for a loan. I urgently needed to get a new car instead of repairing my old one. I’m always late because there are some problems with the engine, and I always get into some funny stories because of that. Well, my boss doesn’t find them that funny, especially when I’m getting late for important meetings. That’s why I’ve decided to buy a new car, and obviously, I’m buying it in leasing.

So, after weeks of searching for a suitable car, calculating the approximate costs, and preparing all the required documents, I finally got my new baby. But, after a couple of days from signing all the paperwork, I’ve got a call from the car dealership. Long story short, they told me that there is a problem with my pay stub and that I need to bring a new one. After I went to their office, they actually pointed on a couple shortcomings in my pay stub. They gave me some time to bring a new one with all corrections.

The issue is that the manager of the financial department and accounting is on maternity leave. She is not returning to work for another couple of months, and her duties are spread across the whole company. But, I found this online pay stub generator — [https://www.thepaystubs.com/](https://www.thepaystubs.com/). Basically, I can fill in all the required information there. Still, how do I make this pay stub valid? At some point, I understand that it requires a signature and a stamp from the finance department. But,  again, I’m not getting in a couple of months. Can our CEO sign it? Or perhaps someone from HR?

I really hope that this is the right sub to address my concerns. As far as I know, that finance department is responsible for things like pay stubs and stuff like this. I would really appreciate it if you could guide me in this situation.
