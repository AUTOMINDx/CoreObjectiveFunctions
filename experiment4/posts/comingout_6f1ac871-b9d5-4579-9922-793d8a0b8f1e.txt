I really really really wanna come out to my parents but I know I can't (tw//homophobia)
I live in a household where being yourself isn't an option.

Hi, my name is Silas and I use it/its pronouns. I can not come out to my parents and I'm not out as myself in school. This is not me ‘coming out’ on Reddit, I've been out on Reddit for a while. I'm out at school just with the wrong identity, I thought I was a binary trans guy. I am an agender man. My sibling (pronouns: they/them) gets to come out in January because they are leaving for university. I have to wait until January, wait for their reactions and then determine whether it is safe to come out. It probably won't be.

For some context, my parents were Trump supporters every step of the way. My mother is a 5th-grade teacher. My dad is a cop. I think that says a lot (unfortunately). My mom says stuff like “I'm fine with *the gays* as long as they don't push it in our faces like they usually do” and “Why does every show have to have a gay couple now? It's so annoying.” I do not hear much stuff from my father in the context of gay people but I know he is usually much more extremist in his views.

I'm not going to come out to them but wish me luck as I need it
