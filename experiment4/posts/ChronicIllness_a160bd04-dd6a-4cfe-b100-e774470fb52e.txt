Different level of care after testing positive for C. Diff
I’ve been in the hospital for a week and tested positive for C. Diff yesterday likely due to antibiotics. And ever since, the nursing care has been a joke. 

I get how serious C. Diff is especially in an acute care setting but I shouldn’t be receiving a different level of care. I shouldn’t have to be using my call bell to get medication that’s an hour overdue - medication I always got on time before. I shouldn’t have to hear the water cart being rolled by and not getting a fresh cup. And I shouldn’t be getting skipped for the 6 am vitals check given I have a pretty nasty infection…
