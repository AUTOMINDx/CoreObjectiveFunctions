I (25M) met a really nice girl at work the other day. We exchanged phone numbers and I eventually asked her on a date. She said she thought I was nice and attractive but she didn’t have the time right now. I thought that was it but she continues to text me. Advice on how to handle this? Thanks!
For some context, we had only been texting for a couple hours. I told her I knew it was forward but I didn’t want to beat around the bush, I thought she was really sweet and attractive so I asked her out. Maybe I moved too fast? I’m unsure because when she answered like she did I thought “ok that’s a no she’s just being nice about it, no big deal.” The texts stopped that night but then she texted me first thing the next morning. Idk what to make of it all and any help would be appreciated!
