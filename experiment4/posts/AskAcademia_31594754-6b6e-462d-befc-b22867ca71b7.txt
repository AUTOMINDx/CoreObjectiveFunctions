Getting a master's degree - worth it or not?
My interest is in Human-Computer Interaction (For reference I'm in the USA). My goal is to become a researcher. I know that eventually I will need to get a PhD. I have heard from grad students in the lab that I work in that one can apply directly for PhD programs out of an undergrad degree. I am wondering if it is worth it to get a master's degree or not. There is a program where I can get a master's degree linked to my bachelor's degree within one additional year at the University I am currently at. Would It be looked down upon by anyone once one has a PhD if they did not get a master's degree?

Also is there any stigma against getting all your degrees from the same university (it's a R1 university if that is significant), i.e. bachelor's degree through PhD?
