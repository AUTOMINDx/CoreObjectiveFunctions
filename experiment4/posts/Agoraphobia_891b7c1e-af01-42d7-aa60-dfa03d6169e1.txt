Please stop asking us to diagnose you. See a specialist.
Please still post here, just stop asking for a diagnosis. You feel what you feel. It doesn't need a label. If you feel that you have symptoms of agoraphobia, then you can look up ways to help you deal with agoraphobia. No one is going to tell you that you can't. If it works, it works.

No one here can diagnose you with being an agoraphobic. I'm incredibly sorry that so many of you have developed this fear since the pandemic, I honestly expected an uptick in posts because of it. The world is very scary right now and has been for a long time. You are not alone in your struggles and we all understand what you're going through. I myself have relapsed hard into agoraphobia. Not leaving the house for months at a time. I used to be able to leave once a week and go all the way to town on public transport but that's become far too much again. I whole-heartedly sympathise with you all, this horrible disease can be life ruining. But please stop asking if you're agoraphobic and see a professional. We don't know. You may have a different issue with fear of being in the house as a *symptom*. We are not doctors and Reddit's advice is as good as using jam as glue. Might work, but probably won't.
