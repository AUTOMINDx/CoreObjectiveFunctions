I always want to quit every job.
Iâ€™m 17 and have had two jobs so far. Both in retail. I quit my first one 5 months in, and I currently work at Walmart as a cashier. Itâ€™s so bad. I hate staying in the same position for 8 hours, and dealing with a never ending line of customers. Most of the times I end up taking my breaks an hour late or not getting a break at all. This one time, I even put up the lane closed sign, and they still came ðŸ˜‘. Iâ€™m only a month in, and I wanna quit already. I cannot imagine doing this my whole life. And I donâ€™t know how anyone can.
