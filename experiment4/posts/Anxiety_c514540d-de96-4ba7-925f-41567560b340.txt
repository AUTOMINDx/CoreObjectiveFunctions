My therapist told me a to cope that I've never heard of before and I thought I'd share!
I struggle with seeing my anxiety as a personality trait, because of how much it impacts my life, so she told me that I should try characterizing my anxiety; giving it a name, a personality, or drawing it out. Just being able to visualize it. This should help me recognize when it is the anxiety talking and not me, and when I see this I can push it aside easier.

It really helps when I get in an anxiety hole and I just have to stop and think, "this isn't me thinking, this is my anxiety." I kind of visualize just scooping up my anxiety character and throwing them away. 

I find i also tend to be very scared of my anxiety, scared of what it does to my body and panic attacks and such, making it a character helps make it less scary. 

I've been in therapy / counseling for *years* and I'd never heard of this! I find it helps me because I'm a very visual person, its a lot easier to picture a character than a feeling.

I've named mine Burt and I picture him as like one of those mucus blobs from the flu med commercials.
