Wanna meet people at the bar? Read a book.
I’m 26m, average height, build, and salary. Currently in a wonderful relationship. 

Hands down the most success I ever had dating was when I was reading a book at the bar. 

I’m no psych major, but it always worked and I felt like I hacked the system. 

Reading a book at a bar is unusual behavior. Unusual, but not threatening. Actually intriguing. 

Intriguing behavior+social lubricant (drinks and atmosphere)= interest and approachability. Hands down, every time I was sitting at a bar with a drink and reading a book, I got approached my multiple people that evening, and they always asked “what are you reading?” 

This gives you an EASY in to a conversation. 

Some considerations: 

1) Pick the right bar. Anything too classy and people might find you pompous, anything too divey and you’ll just be in everyone’s way. 

2) Pick the right book. Whatever book you choose will set the tone for the conversation, so if you’re in the market for someone nerdy like you, go fantasy. If you want someone driven, pick a business or marketing book. Honestly, the best results were always something I was passionate about, as we inherently bring more life to a conversation we care about. 

3) Pick the right drink. People make assumptions based on drinks. Go for something affordable but not cheap, delicious but not extravagant. Mysterious cocktails are always nice, particularly if you know the history behind it and can share a story. Every drink has a story and people love stories. 

Give it a go. Worst case scenario you enjoy a book and a drink. Best case you might find a great, likeminded connection.
