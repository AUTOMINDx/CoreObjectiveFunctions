[DC] If you get tied up with the Lasso of Truth, can you knock yourself unconscious to avoid answering a question?
Say I’m some regular goon that got tied up by Wonder Woman’s lasso. She asked if I knew where my boss was, and if he finds out I snitched, he’ll kill me. Can I hit my head really hard on something so that I knock myself unconscious to avoid answering the question? Could I do it before she asks any questions but while I’m still tied up?
