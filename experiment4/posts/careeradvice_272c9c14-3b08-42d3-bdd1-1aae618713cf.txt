My GF(22) is stressing about her future, any advice?!
(TL:DR) - Need advice on how to help ab indecisive loved one finding a career path.


She is incredibly uncertain about what she wishes to do and is getting extremely upset about not having a set dream. 

She has the habit of latching onto an idea and being obsessive over a single career path but after a few months of working hard and being extremely passionate about it she begins to start doubting herself again and regresses back into uncertainty, it's really affecting her well being. 

I have and will always support whatever path she wishes to go down and I've told her that there is no rush as she's still young/has plenty of time. I don't think she's worried about taking her time but it's upsetting her that she doesn't have anything to aspire to. 

Any advice or ideas on how we can figure out what she really wants to pursue?
