Should I ask my friend how much she is making in the position that she referred me to?
I am currently conflicted you too my friend referring me to a job and I got the job offer and the salaries three dollars more than what she told me the job decision was paying her when I asked about the pay and it’s the same position as her should I do anything about this I feel conflicted maybe she didn’t say the exact number? Just in case I didn’t get the job I wouldn’t know what she gets paid?
