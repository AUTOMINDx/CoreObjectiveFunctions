Consequences for plagiarism by professors?
In my US history course this semester, I was forced to purchase a $94 online textbook that was written by the professor. Everything that was graded (HW/quizzes/etc.) was done through the book publisher's website, so we either had to buy the book or drop the class.

I just realized that nearly half of the sections in the book had been plagiarized from various online sources. There are no citations whatsoever and I've found that entire paragraphs have been copied word for word from news publications/online blogs/government websites. I used the plagiarism checker on Chegg and it found that some sections were as much as 85% plagiarized from other online sources.

I'm just a bit frustrated right now because I had to spend money on this...

If I were to do this on one of my papers I would fail the course and possibly face expulsion. Are there any consequences for professors who commit egregious plagiarism? Should I report it to their department chair?
