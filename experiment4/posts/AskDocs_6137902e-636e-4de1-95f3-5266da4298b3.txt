A careless nurse douched my 17 month old daughter's vagina with enema and I am concerned
34M, India. Asking for my infant daughter.

My daughter accidentally swallowed a small gold pendent, we took her to the hospital, we took x-ray and found it in her abdomen, doctor recommended rectal enema. The nurse who administrated the enema poked the tube into my daughter's vagina and squeezed half of the solution inside. My wife holding my daughter's leg noticed it and stopped the nurse. My daughter screamed her lungs out. The nurse callously reinserted into the rectum and administered the enema.

My daughter passed the pendent in her stool right away, but now I'm sacred of any possible issues from this accident.

"Neotomic Enema" is name of the enima. Its composition is Glycerine, sodium chloride and purified water.
