I just don't get why they don't make applying to jobs easier?
Dear employer, a PSA. I see that you have a job. Linkedin and resumes exist so you can determine if I warrant  consideration. You should not need to know my address. You should not need to know my sexual orientation, whether I'm disabled, how much I 'want' to make (I want to make a million a year, how much do you have? It's your budget - I don't know your life). You should not need me to log in - no one is pretending to be me and applying to jobs for me. And if they were, I'd be good with it. You should not require a cover letter that is just saying the resume differently. You should not give me homework before you have even seen my background. Literally should be as simple as 'this is the job we have, if you are interested, send us your resume'. End of story.
