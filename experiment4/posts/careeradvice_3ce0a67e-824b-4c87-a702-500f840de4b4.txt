I need some serious opinions on my options
Here’s my problem, I absolutely fucking hate university and college. I got an insanely good scholarship (to the tune of 60K) but I failed my first year away from high school. I took a gap year, transferred schools, tried again and just tanked. I want to go into a field like exploration geology but the truth is that I am so royally bad at Calculus that I honestly cannot function. I’ve taken the same course 3 times and I have failed it every time. I find physics boring, chemistry an absolute drag, yet I need all these courses to get the degree. My other option is to go and get a red seal ticket, I’m looking into electrical work or plumbing as of right now but I honestly cannot decide. I’m so stuck, I just need some input. I know if I go through with geology I’ll be able to travel with my degree and work which really appeals to me, that and I find mineral exploration interesting. But I cannot get past how much I hate the schooling. Every-time I talk to a geologist or anyone in the field they always give the same speech that “they never use the vast majority of stuff they learned at school”. Because of this I find it insanely hard to find motivation for the course subjects I hate. 

TLDR; rock and a hard place. Don’t know which way to go, looking for input from people in the field.
