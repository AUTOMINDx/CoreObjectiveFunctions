Given that SARS-COV-2 has generated so much research and investigation to understand the workings of the virus, would this change how we view other common viruses?
I’m talking about things like re-infection, “breakthrough” infections, mutations, transmissibility, infectiousness etc.   Could the scrutiny given to this virus be applied to other viruses and we find out  things like  
-viruses we thought were only transmitted when symptomatic (eg flu I think) can be transmitted asymptomatically?  
-breakthrough infections of measles occurs all the time but with very few symptoms Etc
