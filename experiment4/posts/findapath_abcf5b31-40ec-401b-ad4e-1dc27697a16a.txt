Finally got a job offer today;
I graduated at May with‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­a Bachelor of Arts in Public Administration: Human Resources. Being a graduate with extremely limited experience during pandemic has been draining and disappointing. I applied to over 60 jobs, and interviewed nearly 20 times. I was beginning to feel hopeless when I found a local job at the municipal plant in my city and I got the job. My best advice is to listen to confidence and motivational pep talks before any interview, go in actually wanting the job because I kept telling myself “here’s another waste of my time” and with that attitude I was bound to fail. Watch YouTube videos on how to answer interview questions, and most importantly WRITE A THANK YOU LETTER after your interview. An email can suffice but writing a personal note will keep you on their mind and make you seem like a caring candidate. And the best HR advice I have is to read the job description over and over and use those key words on your resume, cover letter, and especially in the interview. Times are super hard but I promise what’s meant to be for you will be and all your disappointments will melt away when you get the opportunity you really want.
