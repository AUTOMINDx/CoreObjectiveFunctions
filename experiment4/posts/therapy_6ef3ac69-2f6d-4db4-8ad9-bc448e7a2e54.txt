Afraid to tell therapist im feeling better because i enjoy therapy and dont want to be terminated any time soon
Going to therapy for the first time in my life, it was hard and weird first, but ive been looking forward to it so much, its a place of calm and peace and i dont wanna let go of that. So Im kinda scared to tell my therapist up front that im doing better (i would never lie to him, dont worry), because i dont want to have to stop therapy. How does therapy "end" anyway? Is it my decision or his ?
