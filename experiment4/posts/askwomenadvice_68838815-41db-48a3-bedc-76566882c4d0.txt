My sister is in an abusive relationship and i dont know how to help her
My (m16) sister(f20) is in an abusive relationship, she is suffering from deppresion and i try my best to help her to go trough with it. Recently i found out that my sister's boyfriend is emotianally and phisiclly abusive. She told me she has stopped dating him, but he is still contacting her and trying to meet with her. She stopped dating him when she found out he was cheating, but she still has on some occassions met with him and he is still keeps treating like her shit. I myself haven't been in a relationship and i dont know any ways to help her, i suggested her to block him but she still unblocks him after some time. Please help!
