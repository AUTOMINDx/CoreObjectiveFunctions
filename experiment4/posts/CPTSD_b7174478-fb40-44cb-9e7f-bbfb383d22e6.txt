Found out my bf has been suffering from C-ptsd his whole life.
I’ve posted this in relationship advise and they sent me here. He was diagnosed at 9 and dealt with what the physiologist labeled “military like abuse.” Intentional sleep dep/starvation,regular beatings and being screamed at for hours. 
I’ve dated my bf now for about 2 1/2 years and he told me up front. “I don’t drink and I don’t like being around drunk people.” I just kinda thought it was maybe a bit odd but understandable. He always avoids talking about his life or feelings. Well I spoke to his cousin that he’s very close with and she started answering questions he wouldn’t. It honestly made me break down in the truck with him on the drive home. I asked him if it was true and he just sighed and nodded. He said “ well if you have any questions I’ll answer them openly.” I asked about the small scars all over his shoulders and he said cigarette burns. The scars on his face his father put him in the hospital multiple times and wore rings. He said “it’s why I don’t like drunk people. I hear slurred words flash back and I panic. My heart races I get all stressed out and I can’t trust myself.” He said he feels like a broken person and he doesn’t emote feeling because they were literally beaten out of him. He’s bolted awake yelling “get tf off of me!” And going into a full panic attack. I feel so horrible for drinking around him….he said it’s fine but omg he had to be all over the place inside. Can I get some advise how to support him? He’s in therapy but he says it doesn’t help much and he’s scared he’ll always be broken. Anyone with experience here that can help me help him?
