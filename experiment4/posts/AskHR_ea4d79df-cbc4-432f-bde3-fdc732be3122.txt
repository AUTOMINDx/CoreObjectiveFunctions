Hired for remote work [NE] moved to another state permanently
Was hired by a very large tech company, one of the requirements is I live in a specific state. 

Recruiter told me I had to maintain residency or I could lose the job. Contacted manager 3 times telling him I needed to travel to another state for family, he never responded to any of my emails or messages on teams. 

I gave a 7 day period but I'm now permanently in the other state. They haven't noticed and or don't care. What do I do now? Don't want to lose the job but I think if I tell them this is a permanent move I won't be able to keep it. They have an office in this state I'm in now and I could easily drive there if need be.
