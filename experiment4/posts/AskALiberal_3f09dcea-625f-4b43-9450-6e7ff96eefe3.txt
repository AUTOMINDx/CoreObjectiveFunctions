Is there any good reason why the Confederate flag should be seen as something not equivalent to a flag of slavery?
While browsing askconservatives I was both surprised and not to see everyone's favorite mod issue a warning that [equating the Confederate flag with slavery would result in a ban. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/rkq9se/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_great_party_switch/hpeyj7u/)

I've had several discussions with conservatives about the Confederacy which have lead me to do research to back up my opinions and that research has shown that the confederacy was a self described conservative rebellion to protect the institution of slavery and this was known by political leaders, religious leaders, and the  common man. The Confederate flag was the battle flag of a group fighting for slavery and the reason it is known today is due to groups of racist individuals who used it as a marquee to intimidate black people during the early 1900's by reminding them of the past institution of slavery.

Please correct me if I've gotten any of this wrong with actual historical sources.

So all this said, is there any good reason why the Confederate flag should not be seen as equivalent to a flag of slavery?
