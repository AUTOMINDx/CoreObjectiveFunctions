Turkey's interest rate
As of recent, Turkey has been a main stay in the news due to its rising inflation and the devaluation of the Lira. A common talking point is the government's counterproductive course of lowering the country's key interest rate. The lowering of the country's key interest rate from NINETEEN FUCKING PERCENT TO FOURTEEN PERCENT. Turkey's key interest rate is at 14% while most of the world is edging ever more closely towards 0 or even into the negative. Can someone explain that to me?
