How the fuck do people even meet eachother nowadays?
This is seriously one of the loneliest times in the world. These fucking devices we type on etc are the reason we are so anti social in reality.

I have no friends irl, haven't had a girlfriend for a year, and haven't met anyone in forever... I'm only 25 years old

Wtf why is this happening??? Going up to people anymore and talking to eachother seems like it's forbidden?? What the fuck

I want to find a girlfriend at some point but it just seems so hard, those dating apps are ridiculously awful and idk I just can't seem to meet any irl? HOW are people meeting eachother now
