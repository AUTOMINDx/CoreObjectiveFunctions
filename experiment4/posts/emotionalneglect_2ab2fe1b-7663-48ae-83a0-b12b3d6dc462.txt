"Feel my feelings" - but how? i was never shown, and i block them - any advice / tips?
I have been told i need to feel all the sadness and hurt underneath my story, i get that and i have cried a lot, but some of it, i cant connect to emotionally, and i think i am quite blocked from the feelings. 

I guess thats been my surviving mechanism, and i know i have shaved a few layers off, but still, i cant seem to "feel my feelings"

How do people approach feeling these old and painful deep wounds, of neglect, abuse, abandonment etc?
