AlAnon: any help for secular people?
Hey all! My therapist recently suggested that I try attending AlAnon family meetings to deal with / discuss issues relating to my alcoholic mother. 

First, we are in lockdown where I am so I'm looking for online meetings. I went over to the AlAnon Reddit and asked if anyone knew of any non-religious meetings, and other than one online one that doesn't meet my time zone, nothing came up.

What did come up, and really bothered me, was that two others commented that AlAnon MUST reference higher power and that the whole point of AlAnon is that you 'can't do it alone' -- which, I thought meant having the support of people around you, not believing in fairy tales. (Btw, Sorry if you are religious, I'm just not, at all, and nothing will change that for me.)

Anyone here have any alternatives / advice?
