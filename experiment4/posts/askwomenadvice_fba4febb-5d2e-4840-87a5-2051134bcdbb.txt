Need advice - SO still wants kids / I’m old and have no money
Married 13 years. We’ve had our share of issues this whole time due to my mental health issues and substance abuse for each of us. I’m doing MUCH better now that I’m in talk therapy and have the right meds. I see everything clearly for the first time in like 10 years. We had talked about having kids when we were first married. But facing my own demons and self-absorption / substance abuse just made a total sh**show of our marriage, and now it’s too late for me to be a mother.

During a heart to heart, he told me he wants kids. I’m 44. He’s 51. Even if I could GET pregnant now, we don’t have extra money to spare to raise a child. We’re both in lower middle class jobs. Between student loans and mortgage and everyone between, there’s no way we can afford a child. 

I think I already know the solution and because I do truly love him, I need to let him go meet the mother of his children. Right?
