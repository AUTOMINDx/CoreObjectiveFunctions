I think, allowing myself to be miserable and depressed is a major step towards wholeness and healing. Accepting these parts and letting them have their time in the light of consciousness is a major epiphany that just clicked
Fuck toxic positivity. Fuck "you just need something fulfilling to do". Fuck of all of that. All my life I had to pretend to be ok, when in fact I was far from it. 

Allowing myself to be depressed, miserable, sad and empty is exactly what I need to heal. No more pressure to be something others want me to be. Rest. Recuperate. Pause. Being Kind to myself. Only doing as much as feels doable to me without a sweat.

All the parts of me that are not "ok" have the right to bathe in conscious awareness until they are.
