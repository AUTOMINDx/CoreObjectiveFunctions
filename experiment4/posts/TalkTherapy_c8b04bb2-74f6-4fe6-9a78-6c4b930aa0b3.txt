My therapist says we’ve been flirting
My T and I have great rapport. She knows about my romantic transference towards her, and is willing to work with it. Lately, we’ve been joking around more than usual. I recognize that I’ve been flirting, and I feel that it has been reciprocated. T said today, “I feel like we’ve been flirting.” She named it and put up a boundary, stating it could get in the way of the work if we aren’t careful. 

I feel like shit. I feel like I’ve ruined our relationship. She’s been so helpful to me. For context, I’m going on leave from work and I see her a few times a week. Now I just feel awkward.
