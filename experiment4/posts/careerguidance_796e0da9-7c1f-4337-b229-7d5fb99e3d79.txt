Should I pick Work/life balance or career/money? (25F)
Hi Redditors,

Long story short I (25F) got two job offers at hand, but I can't choose between them and I need your advice.

Offer#1: AML officer at a big bank but in a different city (would have to relocate) + great salary but veryyy low work/life balance (1 days off/ 6 working days). 

Offer#2: back office at a new government entity in my city 15 mins drive from my home + average salary, but considerably lower than the first offer, amazing work/life balance (2.5 days off/ 4.5 working days).

Basically, at my age should I go after work/life balance or the good career/money?
