How to stop my mother giving me hurtful advice?
I've been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, general anxiety and PTSD for 3 years now, however I've already had symptoms of those illnesses for much longer. I however had been unable to get help because my symptoms were too strong to get help on my own and my Mother didn't believe that I had mental illnesses. By now she accepted it more or less, even though she blames my antidepressants for everything (including making my depression worse because I now can actually vocalise that I'm not okay). However whenever I mention not feeling amazing she tells me to just think positively and to do progressive muscle relaxation, as well as that I'm depressed because I stay in the house (which I do because of severe anxiety which is strong enough that I physically wouldn't be able to leave the house without my pills). The problem is that it really doesn't help and it simplifies my problem a lot. However when I tell her that she blames me for never listening to her and keeps on saying that she also struggles because of me.

I get that and I feel sorry for her having to deal with me but all that unsolicited advice makes me feel very misunderstood. How do I stop her from giving advice like this? By now only leaving my room already makes my heart pound like crazy and I'm not even safe in my room since I don't have a key to my room, so I can't just ignore it.
