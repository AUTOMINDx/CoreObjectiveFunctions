Someone asked why I talk so slowly with pauses in between (in a voice note), I haven't answered yet.
I've been exchanging messages with an old friend about meeting up soon. I told her in a voice note that I'm gonna be in the same place she is and was responding to what she said. In reply, she sent a voice note in which she began by asking me why I was talking slowly and with pauses. 

I felt I was talking fine, and even if I was talking slowly and with pauses I wouldn't appreciate being asked this. Also whatsapp has the speed option for voice notes if someone wants to speed it up, so really I didn't appreciate it. Maybe she was concerned. Still. 

I don't know how to reply to that question. I don't want to be defensive or hurtful, but assertive and honest.
