What were the (some?) sexual norms of societies that lived in communal dwellings?
I know this is a pretty broad question, but I'm interested in any culture that lived in a place with little privacy. If several families lived in a single dwelling like a longhouse, how did they get it on? Were they expected to be quiet? Did the kids and grandparents just know what was going on and ignore it? Were couples expected to do their copulating in the woods?
