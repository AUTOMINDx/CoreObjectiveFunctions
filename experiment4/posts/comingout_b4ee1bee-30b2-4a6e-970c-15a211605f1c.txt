Pls help
I came out today as bi and it was the worst way imaginable, pls don’t judge cause it was my mistake and I wanna die over how stupid it was. Ik I can’t post nsfw so I’ll try and go around it. I was sitting on my bed with my t0y and decided to go to the bathroom. I’m stupid and forgot to hide it before I let and my mom immediately knocked on my door asking what it’s doing there. And the second I rushed out of the bathroom I broke down. 

I just started crying and I couldn’t take the stress, I came out to her right there as my dad watched. She kept telling me it was ok but I feel like she was judging me at the same time. After they both left I just locked my door and began to cry in my bed and haven’t moved since. 

Ik it isn’t as bad as most story’s go but I just can’t cope with what has just happened, if I get shit for this then whatever. But if there is someone who can maybe give me a little bit of advice on how to cope with this I’d appreciate it.
