Lost in life
I am a 20 year old still living with my parents and working part time at Walmart. I decided not to go college right after I graduated high school because I didn't know what I wanted to study. I recently told my dad I wanted to enroll into college and join the pastry program. I also don't have my driver's license so I thought online college would be the best for me. I showed my dad an online college I found that has a pastry program. He wasn't to sure about the online college I showed him. After the talk we had I realized that I only like baking as a hobby and that I wouldn't like it to be my career path way. I have literally switched what I wanted to study 3-4 times. I feel like I'm a failure and that I'm letting my dad down. I am completely lost. How does one find there career path way?
