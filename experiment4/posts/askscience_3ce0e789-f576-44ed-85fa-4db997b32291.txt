How did the Parker Sun Probe manage to broadcast video, telemetry and other data to Earth, without being affected by solar flares or noise from the radiation?
Weren't solar flares strong enough to disrupt Earth's ground infrastructure? I've seen the overly exaggerated articles, but at that proximity to the sun, wouldn't it mess with Parker's communication too?

Been wondering how we got that crystal clear video of the Milky Way, with the planets outlines, and with very minimal artifacting.
