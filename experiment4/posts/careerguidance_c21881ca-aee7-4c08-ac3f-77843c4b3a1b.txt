What are some rather repetitive and easy jobs?
I‘m 18 and have severe social anxiety, depression and ocd so I’m just searching for anything, I don’t mind if it doesn’t pay well, I just want to do something. I don’t really have any passions. I’m really bad at math but otherwise pretty average at most things. I’m a very fast reader though. I want something with clear rules/instructions, preferably something in which I don’t have to sell people things.

Edit: should’ve probably put this earlier, but something that doesn’t require a lot of physical strength would be better
