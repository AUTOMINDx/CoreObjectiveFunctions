Feel like a year of counseling has been a waste of time
All I’ve been doing since January is talk about my day and week, is that what counselling is? the only thing I actually enjoy is spending time with my counselor tbh, and I already know that in itself is kinda Fucked up because I wholeheartedly just have an attachment to my counselor,  I have literally gained nothing from my sessions with her other than an attachment.
I’m still depressed and incredibly lonely and passively suicidal (some of this she doesn’t know and some she does I believe)

she keeps teaching me DBT techniques all the time for my anxiety, even though I told her they weren’t working for me and made me feel weird doing them. Now she’s teaching me more DBT for my separation anxiety,’like what??????

I just don’t understand what is counselling supposed to be, also my counselor is a university student so maybe her behaviour and approach is off because She hasn’t finished her university or schooling/psychology degree yet? 

is she waiting for me to talk about things?
