This disorder is a joke. Okay it's not a joke but I hate this life sometimes. And maybe this is the entitlement talking but I dont wanna work so hard to be a good person or to get help. Seems the only way to not hurt others is to just isolate yourself. When I'm around others it's very hard to control my narcissism. I wanna live a normal life like other young people. Plus I feel "depressed" and dont even know where to start.  And I feel I dont have time to work on myself plus I dont even know how

Edit: I cant handle rejection even if I know things would never work out and persons not right for me. It makes me feel like a failure
