What are your thoughts on Governor Polis not extending statewide mask mandates?
[Here’s the interview](https://www.cpr.org/2021/12/10/interview-gov-jared-polis-mask-mandates-covid/), but Polis’ point is basically “I issued a mask mandate when there wasn’t a vaccine, we have a vaccine now, if you don’t get vaccinated it’s your own darn fault.” (That last part isn’t editorializing, but nearly verbatim.)

He definitely won’t overrule local mandates (and plenty of metro areas have them), but he won’t issue his own statewide one. 

Do you think this is a good health decision with the new variant? Do you think he’s right that they’re not needed as we have a vaccine? Do you think this is more about good policy or about 2022? I’d love any thoughts, as always.
