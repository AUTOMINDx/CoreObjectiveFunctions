Wife (43f) cheated on me 2 years ago we decided to stay together now I think I made a mistake
Two years ago my wife cheated on me while on a work trip. She was enjoying a night out with some colleagues when she met a guy a hooked up with him, but they didnt have sex. I am sure that they didnt have sex because her company is very strict about bringing anyone to the rooms when someone is on official trip, they could lose their job. She confessed the next morning and we did some counselling and finally we decided to reconcile. Then covid lockdown hit and the whole world turned to sh\*t. But we kept reconciling.

Here I am 2 years later, thinking that I made a mistake. Dont get me wrong, she has been the model spouse the whole time and we didnt drive each other mad during the lockdowns, so thats something. But lately I have been getting the feeling that I am living a lie. From getting up in the morning to going back to sleep during the night, I am playing a role. I feel like I am wearing a mask of someone else and the real me is lost somewhere. I dont know if I am making sense right now, I guess I just needed to get it off my chest. Its my first post in here, so I dont know if what I wrote will be accepted or not. I just want some peace!
