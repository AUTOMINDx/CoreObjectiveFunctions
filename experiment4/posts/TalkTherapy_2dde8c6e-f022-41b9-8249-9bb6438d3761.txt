How often do you think about therapy?
I go to therapy every couple of weeks. It’s not really for any particular struggle, but more so to manage the general stress, challenges and anxiety of everyday life. I feel like it’s helped me immensely and keeps me grounded. However, outside of my sessions I feel like I’m constantly thinking about things we have discussed or will discuss. I’m curious if others have the same feeling? To an extent, I guess it is a good thing as it helps me in my approach to different situations, but is this normal?
