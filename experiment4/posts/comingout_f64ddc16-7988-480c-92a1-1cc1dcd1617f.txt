Came out to my religious mom
I just came out to my religious mom, i told her i dont like men and damn.. i dont even know what to say. She started crying and she said she wished she had died today instead of this. My mom is a really good mom and i know that sheâ€˜s just hurting cuz she thinks this is bad but God.. did all of this broke my heart. I tried to tell myself to expect the worst but i feel like a tiny part in my heart still hoped that she would understand. At the end i just lied to her that i will try to change and that she shouldnt worry. I regret telling her.. and i just dont understand why the universe is making me go through all of this. I do wanna leave the country after finishing uni cuz i wont ever be free here where my family is.. but i also dont want to leave my mom. She has been my everything all these years and im just so broken cuz idk what to do.
