[CA] If I say "do not contact an employer" on the application will the prospective employer respect this 100%?
I am applying to a local county government position.

I was working at my current job for 10~ months before they transferred us to another company. I have been working there for ~3 weeks. I want out and am applying elsewhere.

I could be in trouble if my current employer finds out I am applying elsewhere. They do not like people leaving since many have been 

When I put in my work experience in the application and check NO on "Can we contact this employer", does HR/recruiting follow this rule 100%? Will they not contact this employer at all for any reason? Or should I just leave it out period since it has only been 3 weeks.

I need to be sure they will absolutely 100% not contact them at all. Period. Not even a phonecall to see if I work there.

Since its barely been 3 weeks, could I just leave it out? Or do I need to leave it in because it is my current employer?
