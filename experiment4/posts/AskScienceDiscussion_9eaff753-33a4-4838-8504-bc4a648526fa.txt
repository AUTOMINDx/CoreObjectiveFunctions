Why did all other species of human like the Neanderthals, Homo floresiensis, and homo naledi go extinct? Why are we the only species of humans left when ours species line seemed to be so successful and advanced compared to all other life?
I never understood why or how this happened considering humans were and still are the top living organisms on the planet. 

As a follow up question is it good or bad that only Homo sapiens exists today?

I’ve always felt it’d be awesome if Neanderthals and homo floresiensis still exist because we wouldn’t feel as alone on the planet and we would have much more relatability to them, as they would be other species in our same line of hominid, and much easier communication and or similar understanding than any animals that exist today. We wouldn’t feel like the end all be all king of the earth as humans because they’re would be other species similar to us around.
