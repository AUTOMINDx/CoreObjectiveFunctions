Dysfunctional Family Bingo
This year with lots of therapy and CoDa, I am in a much better place for the holidays. I’m usually triggered as hell and spiral down. So this year, I am writing a Christmas Bingo game in my journal to entertain myself and share with my therapist in the new year. 

So far I have:

-Uses avoidance as conflict resolution 

-my nMom attributing my son’s musical talents to his great-great-great grandfather’s musical talents (he was of some importance in his time).  My son doesn’t actually get the credit. 

And I’ve only begun. What is on your game?
