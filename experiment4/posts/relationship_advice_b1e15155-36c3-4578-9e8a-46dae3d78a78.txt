My friends are very unhappy with my girlfriends sexist comments to their son how do I address this?
My girlfriend (f30) and I were at my friends house, they have a son and daughter both are twins and around 7 years old. When we were playing with them my girlfriend kept saying things to their daughter like "you're a lot smarter because you're a girl right" and " let's show the boys how girls can do it better". I personally didn't think all that much about her comments as I thought they were just for fun but my friends didn't see it that way. They were very upset and called me when I got home saying they didn't appreciate her putting down their son like that. 

I know this should be simple but my girlfriend is extremely defensive about things like this. I know how the conversation is going to go, she's going to get all upset then be extremely passive aggressive the next time she sees our friends. What do I do??


Edit please I'm begging you to stop with the hateful private messages. I've received so many, I'm so sorry if I offended anyone that was never my intention.
