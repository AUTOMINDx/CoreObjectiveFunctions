Please describe your subjective experience of "Narcissistic Rage"
*...The other thing \[that NPD patients suffer from\] is difficulty in articulating their subjective experience of suffering...*

I was just wondering if it's hard to explain Narcissistic Rage in vivid detail for anyone else. 

Personally, I think the way I rage (suffer) is extremely hard to describe and I indeed find it hard to articulate. It happened to me one week ago. 

* It lasted for about 4 days. I could not calm down for 4 days. I was thinking about the source of the injury for about 5+ hrs per day, could be 10. 
* All the time I kept thinking to myself: *this is irrational, out of proportion anger. Continuing to ruminate on this is not productive and I should have had enough 5 hours ago, yet I still can't stop raging, looks like I won't be able to fall asleep.* 
* Tons of weed do not help. Weed makes me fantasize more...
* ...and I have fantasies of aggression. Like, fantasies of power plays, ruining somebody in my workplace, uniting people against someone, physical destruction... But mostly, fantasies about "what I could've said better. How else I could've won the argument". It's not like I didn't win the recent argument. I just had to win it 50 more times in my mind...
* ...and re-living the events in the form of fantasies means that I am constantly in the argument, thus the conflict is not over, rage is prolonged...
* I also often wonder "wtf am I feeling right now". "Is it anger? Am I sad? Am I anxious? wtf exactly is this?"
* I am trying to identify my feelings and emotions so that I can navigate them, but I fail to do so. They are strong as hell, but they are hard to understand. "I think it's anger. But wait, if it was anger, I would feel it in my body more... it seems to be going in my mind only... is it grief? Am I grieving? Am I suffering from a loss? Maybe I am envious of something? When was the last time I was envious, how did it feel, is it similar to what I'm experiencing right now?"
* I mean, really, I wish I could know what I feel. 
* Perception of time (sense of time) is slightly off. I've been lying down and thinking for 5 minutes, I look at the clock and am shocked to realize that it was 2 hours.
* "Why am I so fixated on this? Why do I care so much?"
