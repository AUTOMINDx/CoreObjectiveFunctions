Don’t know where else to post this.
Sorry about the huge wall of text.
So, I (13m) tried to show my dad something funny online. My dad closed out safari &amp; checked my email. He saw that I had 10 unread emails &amp; started screaming at me. My mom was out shopping &amp; she walked back in &amp; started screaming at him that it “didn’t fucking matter that much.” My dad started hurling insults at my mom. My mom tried to yell back but my dad threw a book at her. She ran into her bedroom &amp; sobbed “this isn’t the man who I married”. My dad yelled back “cry your heart out bitch, it’s your fault the kids turned out like this.” I ran into the bathroom &amp; I hid out there for a few hours. My mom knocked on the door &amp; said he was taking a shower &amp; it was safe to come out. She tryed to convince me it was just normal family fighting. It’s morning now &amp; they’re acting like nothing happened.

Is this just normal family fighting? They’ve never acted like this. I don’t know if this is normal or if I should be worried.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub, I don’t know where else to post this.
Edit: I should probably mention this, my dad works 80 hours a week &amp; his job is super high stress. He’s always a bit on edge.

Edit: I can’t be online for a little. I’m sorry if I don’t respond to your comments immediately. I want to thank you all for the outpouring of love &amp; support I’ve received. Thank you all so much.
