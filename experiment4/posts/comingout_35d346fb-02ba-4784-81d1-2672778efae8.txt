I was outed as gay without my permission.
So this really fucking sucks. I was working with my uncle around the house and I wasn't wearing my pride bracelet I usually wear because I didn't want it to get dirty. My uncle noticed and asked my aunt if I was worried he'd be offended by it. He told her that while he doesn't understand being gay or pansexual like I am he's accepting of it. Then she said "You know, he's been think that he might be gay and has been wanting to tell you.". He said he was fine with that and she hurried to tell me the good news. She was so shocked when I started having a full on panic attack. A couple of things; #1 She and I had a talk about my being gay awhile ago and I tried my hardest to explain to her that I'm pansexual but lean more towards men, so I say I'm gay. I thought she understood but apparently to her I'm still questioning so that hurts. #2 She herself had told me to wait until **I FELT READY TO TELL MY UNCLE.** She thought he would react well but wasn't entirely sure. But she said "I look forward to the day when we can let him in on this secret.". I don't even know what she was thinking. #3 This is such a betrayal and she doesn't realize it. **She's confused about why I'm mad at her.** She's saying how great it is that he's accepting of me and is getting defensive whenever I get angry with her. **She says I'm just throwing a fit and that she was just trying to help me.** This has messed up so much for our relationship I don't even know how to talk to her right now. Being around her makes me feel sick to my stomach. But the problem is, for the foreseeable future **I'M STUCK LIVING WITH THEM!** I'm glad my uncle is accepting, but I trusted her with so much and she just went behind my back and ruined it. I just really needed to talk about this.
