How can I stop letting this affect me so much?
My partner(34m) and I(25f) have a nonexistent sex life. We’ve never had sex before and do nothing in between. He relies on porn and looking at seductive photos of women online, that’s all he needs. He clearly knows how I feel and how it’s been affecting me but nothing seems to be changing. 

This has been like rubbing salt on all my insecurities. I keep obsessing and I can’t get anything else done. I have things I need to focus on but I lack motivation because I’m so consumed with this. How can I stop taking this personally and feeling bad about myself?
