Just told my friend I'm trans...
Just texted and told my irl friend I'm trans.. Everyone's asleep around here... Middle of the night so I don't expect a response from her until the morning... Will update, but cannot sleep as I feel very anxious...

Edit: hasnt responded to me... :/

What I said tho:

I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm just gonna rip it off like a bandaid: I'm fucking trans and I just fucking want to be me instead of what everyone else thinks is me. I've been trying to fight it for 10 fucking years but it just won't go away... I can't stand to see my fucking face in the mirror, it just fucking feels so wrong and weird to me. I am sorry if this bothers u, I mean absolutely no fucking offense for wanting to be me but I'm hoping youll at least try to understand and support me
