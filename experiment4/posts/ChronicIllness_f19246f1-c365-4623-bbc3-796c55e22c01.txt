PSA: Everyone is welcome here!
This doesn't feel like something I should have to say but after this issue occuring multiple times in the past few months, I feel it warrants a post.

This sub is an open community to everyone with chronic illnesses, or who want to support those with chronic illness, or gain more understanding. This includes both physical and mental illnesses, and for the record we consider addiction a disease as well. No one is required to disclose their personal medical information to be here.

No one is allowed to tell others they do not belong in this sub, this is a violation of first and foremost rule, be respectful. The only people who get to determine if someone does or does not belong here are the mods. If we believe someone is a threat to the community or repeatedly breaks our rules, we will ban them. If you feel someone is a threat to this community, contact modmail. But you are absolutely not allowed to tell someone they are not welcome here or should not be here, ever.

*recommending other communities that may also be helpful is still allowed, and tagging lostredditors for people who clearly accidentally posted to the wrong sub is also still permitted. Gatekeeping this community is not.
