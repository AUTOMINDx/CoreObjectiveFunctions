Dad denied me food after working for 10hours and forced me to reenact a traumatic car accident
I’m a 22 y/o student who works 40+ hours per week and lives at home because I’m saving for a mortgage. 
A few days ago, I came home from working a 10hr day and my dad forced me to recreate an accident my sister and I were in and yelled at me, gaslit me and humiliated me to break me down. Earlier in the day, I broke down while driving from my anxiety that was a result of the recent accident; I was not in the right headspace to revisit the incident. My dad withheld food and water to me as I broke down explaining I was exhausted and could answer the car accident related questions adequately once I ate. 
Last night around 9:30pm, I came home from another 10hr day showered, and came downstairs to wash my lunch dishes and make some dinner. Out of nowhere my dad yelled at me to leave the kitchen. I calmly asked why and he screamed louder for me to leave. I was already shaking from hunger and left the house to get my own food. My mom justifies his actions and always refers to his ‘positive traits’ so I’m on my own in this.
I’m considering moving out now because of this toxic behaviour from my dad towards me. It’s unwarranted, completely inappropriate and shameful.
