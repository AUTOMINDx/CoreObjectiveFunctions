Getting over my Ex
9 months now since it happened, it was mainly my fault, but we both had our share, but I ended the relationship because I was becoming really toxic. She moved on and I am still here avoiding watching Bojack Horseman because it was her favorite show and I did not want to watch with her. I will get better, I say it everyday, some days I dont say it. Im here to say it as a mark, I will get better, I will get over her and remember her because she was an amazing and sweet smart girl and I wish the best for her and for myself. I will get better.
