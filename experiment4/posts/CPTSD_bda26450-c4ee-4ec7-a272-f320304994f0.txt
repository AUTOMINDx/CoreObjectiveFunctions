Anyone else struggling with basic social skills?
I was recently diagnosed with CPTSD (22f) as a result of physical and emotional bullying by peers throughout most of my school years. Over the 4 years I've been in university I have not made a single friend, or even acquaintance. I just *don't know* how to approach people, I don't know how to make small talk. It feels like they all speak a foreign language, a language I don't understand. Whenever someone is nice to me I immediately think they secretly want to exploit me, harass me or humiliate me. And the worst thing is i don't really think they want to do harm but can't *convince* my subconscious otherwise.

Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I wanted to know if maybe I'm not alone in not understanding humans anymore.
