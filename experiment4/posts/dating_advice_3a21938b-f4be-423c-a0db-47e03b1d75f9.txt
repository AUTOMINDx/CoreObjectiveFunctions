He sent me a picture cuddling with another girl??
I don't get it, me and him have been talking for weeks and flirt all the time. Now we mainly talk a little over snap because I'm on vacation, but we take some of the same classes and talk and laugh when it's during the classes. He always sends me fullface pictures and of him in the mirror at the gym, and flirts back. We were snapping all of last night and this morning I wake up n ask him a question like normal and get a snap from him with his and her full face and cuddling with this girl, twice. I don't get guys, I give up. What the f does he want. I was literally about to send "cute sister" back.
