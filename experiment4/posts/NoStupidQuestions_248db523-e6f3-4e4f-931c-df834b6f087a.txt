Why do we train our kids to expect winter break and summer holidays but take away that privilege when we're adults?
Seriously.... For the first 18 to 23 years of our lives, we get summer holidays, winter break and spring break and it becomes part of normal life, but we can't get enough vacation to even come close to approximating it when we're adults?

Edit:. The suggestions to "work harder so you can afford it" or "be a teacher" make no sense. If everybody worked harder, then we would all still be in the same place. I make enough to take the time off, and I get 6 official weeks of vacation, and I live in North America, but that doesn't mean I expect everybody to be a be to afford to do the same since we simply don't have an economy structured to allow for everyone to get what they want if they work hard enough.

But I guess my edit answered my own question. Thanks Reddit. Ha
