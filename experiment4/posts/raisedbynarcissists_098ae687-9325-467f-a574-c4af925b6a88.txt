I Walked out of my Husband's Family Christmas for Refusing to Allow His Aunt to Deadname Our Trans Son

Ok this is not really a narc story, but I'm not sure where to post this and I needed to rant!

So for some background my 16 year old, whom we will call A (and this was posted with his permission), told us last year about this time that they wanted to begin using they/ them, and sometimes he/him pronouns and had chosen a new name to go by. I will admit at first I had a hard time with it and made mistakes a lot, still do sometimes, but I am working on it and getting better.

Fast forward to Thanksgiving this year and my husbands Aunts are pestering my 17 year old about A, asking why he doesn't want to be touched, why (Deadname) wants to go by a new name blah, blah, blah. Not asking me or my husband about it, but my oldest daughter, and got upset with what she told them he was not (Deadname) anymore but goes by A now, and were offended that they were corrected by what they see as a child, so there was a blowup and my husband walked out of Thanksgiving with the kids (I was already home with A and our youngest as she didn't feel well and A doesn't like crowds etc.) So they know we are serious about respecting names and pronouns etc. for at least a month, but this has been a thing for much longer.

Now onto yesterday, Christmas is at the Aunts house. Everything for A from the three aunts is addressed to his deadname, which understandably upset him. Aunt P then goes outside to talk to A, who is crying and upset, and doesn't want to talk at that moment, says they can talk later. Well later when A has calmed down they went to ask Aunt P if they could talk with her, Aunt S, and Aunt J, and was told "Now's not an appropriate time to talk, because I'm entertaining guests." So A went elsewhere to sit down and stay away from the situation.

My other kids soon started asking to go home so we started packing up to leave. As I am about to walk out to the car with more stuff, Aunt P hands me two candies and says, "Here, I promised these to (Deadname) earlier." "Who?" I said.

"(Deadname)"

"Who?"

"(Deadname)"

"Who?"

(sigh) "(Deadname)"

I gave her three chances, then said, "Look, I don't have a (Deadname) anymore, so who are these for?" She then tries to usher me outside saying, "Look we're not going to get into this in front of everyone, and you don't need to take that tone of voice with me!" I then said, "Yes we WILL talk about this in front of everyone because you are disrespecting my child, and I won't have it!" Aunt P then grabs the candy from me and says, "Well, then we can discuss this later!" I then stormed out and told my husband "We're leaving! NOW!" and we left!

Edited to add: The aunts say they don't understand because no one ever communicated this to them and they "deserve" an explanation, and were highly offended when I told them it was none of their business, which is when I got told I don't need to take that tone of voice with them. Also at least one cousin and A's grandparents, all refer to A as A not his deadname and use they/them and he/him pronouns so it really is just the three religious aunts causing all the problems. I don't think we will be spending much time with them anymore.

Edited to add again: WOW! This post blew up! I didn't expect this to get so much traction, or hate. I want to thank the MODS for all their hard work, and enforcement of the rules, and everyone for the awards. Thank you for all the support, I was feeling like I might have been in the wrong as I have a tendency to act without thinking sometimes, and I know my husband was upset when we left that I had yelled at his aunt because he had told me to try to not to give her the evil eye too much for upsetting A, but he was fine with what happened after we talked later. Once again thank you for all the support and letting me I did the right thing by my kiddo. he's a pretty awesome kid if I do say so myself!
