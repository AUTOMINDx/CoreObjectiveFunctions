Getting vaccinated today?
I'm getting the Pfizer vaccine today, and my mother is freaking our on me saying I'm going to die, and that I'll get severe heart problems etc. I know theres a chance that can happen, but nowhere online can I find an actual percentage on the chances of vaccine complications, does anyone have the statistics on those? Just fyi I'm 18 years old and relatively healthy, I was also wondering what effects did you all have afterwards as well, and if any severely or moderately affected you.

Edit: Geez I didn't know this would get that big, thought only a few people would comment, but thanks for all the feedback!

Edit 2: this is not the place for the anti vaxx crowd's disinformation campaign. False information is disgusting and you should be ashamed. This goes for both sides as well. This is a question for personal experiences who have had the shot, not those who haven't.

Edit 3: Stop insulting / commenting on my mother, there is no constructive feedback or good in doing so. Please respect that, thank you.

UPDATE:
Got my first dose just now, and I gotta wait 15 minutes. I am a bit stressed and anxious though but I'm sure I'll be ok! And I'll update this later as well!
