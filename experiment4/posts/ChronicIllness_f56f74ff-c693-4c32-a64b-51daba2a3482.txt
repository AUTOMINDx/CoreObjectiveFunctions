Don’t you hate it when you mention your illness or disabilty for a practical reason and the person you tell thinks that’s their cue to spew out platitudes or patronise you?
No, employee at government department, I did not tell you I was ill so that you could say you feel sorry for me. You do not feel sorry for me! We are total strangers who will never meet. And now you are going to repeat everything four times when I obviously understood it the first time?

I told you I was ill because it was relevant! – to explain why I didn’t reply to some emails so we could deal with the mess your colleague made two months ago that I didn’t find out about until today. Ugh.
