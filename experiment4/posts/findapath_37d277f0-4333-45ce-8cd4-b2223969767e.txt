Just finished my Associates 6 months after graduating highschool. Is the debt of a four year college really worth it?
I turned 18 and graduated summer 2021. I took a lot of AP tests and discounted dual enrollment college classes during my time in high school, so I only needed one class to finish my Associates at a local community college.

I'd like to get a Bachelors degree of course, and I think it would be nice to have a real, "college experience," but I just don't know it it's worth the money. I live with my mom who makes ~$25k annually right now, and my dad is unlikely to contribute anything either. So, to sum it up, I'm not expecting to get any financial aid from my parents.

I only have $3k saved right now from my last job because I had to pay $1.5k for my community college classes this semester. (I received no aid this year because my FAFSA was from my parents pre-divorce combined earnings).

I've applied for a handful of colleges, my family really wants to move out of state so they don't want me staying in state for college, so average tuition is looking like around 15k a year with aid for most public universities.

I just don't know whether it's worth it or not to go to a four year college right now. I feel like I would feel left behind by my peers if I didn't, but I just don't have the money they have unfortunately. I'm planning on maybe majoring in Comp Sci, because although my favorite subject is biology that's not a degree that will pay for itself.

Sorry for the stupidly long post. Does anyone have any advice? I feel so conflicted. It's really confusing, and I'm a first gen student so my parents can't really help. Now that I've graduated and completed my internship I can go back to working and saving, but I still am so wary of the cost of college after reading about all the, "useless degree," horror stories online.
