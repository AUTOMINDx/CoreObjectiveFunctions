My brother died and both the children he left behind are disabled
My brother was a single father and left behind 2 children. One has epilepsy (under control) and the other is diabetic. They live with their grandmother (my brothers mother, we are half siblings) and she’s extremely disabled too. The children eat processed food and sugar all day and have had many trips to the hospital. I want to take them and care for them but first of all they live across the country second I am a really poor student living with my parents and third no one else in my family cares about them they have completely abandoned them. I am so upset w my father for abandoning his grandchildren and for my brother being disabled and having children knowing they would suffer with the same disabilities. But these children don’t deserve to die over being born into a bad situation and I love them. What should I do?
