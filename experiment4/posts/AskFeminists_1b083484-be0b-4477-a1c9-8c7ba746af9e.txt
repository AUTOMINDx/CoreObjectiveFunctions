Is it misogynist to not want straight women in gay spaces?
Earlier today I saw a tweet that said, to paraphrase, “if gay men bring their straight girlfriends to gay bars, we (other gay men) will hate all of you.” The tweet caused a lot of discussion with overwhelmingly negative reactions from both straight women and gay men, saying that gay allies should always be welcome in gay spaces, and that because you can’t always tell the difference between straight and gay women it basically boils down to misogyny.

I have mixed feelings about the tweet and its reactions. I do believe the man who posted it was definitely a misogynist, based on some other comments he made, and there’s definitely an undercurrent of misogyny to assuming that any woman at a gay bar is straight and therefore to be excluded. But I also feel like there might be a kernel of truth to allies (straight women included) sort of colonizing gay spaces. Straight people can fetishize gay people and treat going to a gay bar like going to a zoo, where they can gawk at them or treat them condescendingly. I understand that women often go to gay bars so they won’t get hit on, but can’t that undermine queer spaces? Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think straight women are unwelcome at gay bars! But I think there’s value in preserving queer spaces and preventing them from becoming straight ally spaces (gays also welcome!) 

Thoughts?
