Will An Unused LED TV Degrade Over Time .
Since I own no need or desire for a Smart TV, I've spent some time searching and eventually found a basic LED TV that's exactly what I'm looking for in terms of image quality and size. Considering how hard it was for me to find this TV, I'm thinking about buying a spare so I'd have a replacement ready for when this one eventually breaks down. So here's my question: If I â €don't use the spare TV or connect it to anything for close to ten years (or possibly longer), will the parts inside it still breakdown / fail? I know certain electronics like SSD hard drives will eventually fail if left unpowered for an extended period of time, but how about the components within a television?
