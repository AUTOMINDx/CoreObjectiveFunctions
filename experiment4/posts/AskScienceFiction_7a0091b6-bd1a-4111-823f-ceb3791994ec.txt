[General] Has any villain ever tried to weaponize the power of love?
Edit: In a magical or Clarke's third law sort of way, I mean.

Second edit: In a way that doesn't involve mind controlling or otherwise fantastically influencing of one or more lovers.

Third edit, three days later: Sorry not to have been more clear about what I meant when I first posted this. Also sorry not to have added this apology earlier. (Also my second edit was from the day after the night when I posted it; sorry about that too.)
