Knee injections withheld due to booster "requirement." Is that ethical?
Patient: 74M, 250lbs, 5'11'', diabetic, knee arthritis.

My 74 yo father was refused cortisone injections in his knees by his doctor until he gets a Covid booster shot. He got the two Moderna shots back in late January but he's a conspiracy theorist and has been refusing to get boosted. We've been trying to convince him, but he's stubborn. His knees are in extreme pain and he's eventually going to have knee replacement surgery. His doctor told him she wouldn't give him the steroid treatment until he took the booster, which means his injections will now be pushed back 6 weeks (next available appointment) and he'll continue to be in pain (he can barely walk these days).

NOTE: Please know I'm extremely pro vaccine-- I (36yo daughter) got fully vaccinated and boosted at my earliest opportunity, and I'm not in any way arguing the efficacy or safety of any of the covid vaccines...

I know steroids weaken the immune system, but is withholding them justifiable for the booster? My dad feels kind of extorted into it, and I'm upset about his loss of agency in the situation (though secretly grateful he's now getting boosted).
