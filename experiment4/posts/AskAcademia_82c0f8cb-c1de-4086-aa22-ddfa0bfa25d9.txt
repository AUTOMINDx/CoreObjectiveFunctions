Fear of failing my defense
My PhD defense is about 5 weeks from now and I'm really nervous that I'm not going to be prepared for it.

I have been working part-time during my PhD and I just landed a full-time job. I quit my part-time job with my last day being 12 days from today, and then I start my new job the following week. I asked my new employer if it was possible to start after my defense but they said they prefer I start as soon as possible because they are quite busy and need to train me. They said they are happy to give me some days off prior to my defense to make sure I am prepared for it. I've been trying to find the time and energy to study when I'm not working but I'm worried that it will become more difficult once I start my new job. I'll pretty much only have evenings and weekends to study. My PI knows I work part-time and is aware that I've been looking for a full-time job since I was nearing the end of writing my dissertation. 

I'm really anxious that I'm going to be unprepared for my defense and fail. How likely is it to fail a PhD defense? Has anyone here worked full-time while preparing for a defense? Any advice or reassurances are welcome. Thanks!
