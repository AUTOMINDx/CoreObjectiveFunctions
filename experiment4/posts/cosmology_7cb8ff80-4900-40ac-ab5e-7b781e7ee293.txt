Inflation and quark separation
Hypothetically, during inflation, quark pairs would have been separated extremely rapidly and powerfully from one another. When quarks separate a certain distance, the energy it takes to separate them is enough to generate a new quark pair. Would inflation have generated many quark pairs by forcing separation of quarks, or does inflation not add energy to the system when it separates the quarks in the same way that dark energy isn't applying a force accelerating galaxies away from us, but is merely an expansion of the space between?
