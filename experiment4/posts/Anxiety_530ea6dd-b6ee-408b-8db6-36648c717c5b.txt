Just threw up at work. Starting to feel like I'm not able for a normal job
So I work as an engineer in construction. Understaffed and under pressure. Last few weeks I've been vomiting sometimes at work, getting chest pains and not sleeping well. Today I vomited and decided to go home saying it was because of my upset stomach.

Really starting to feel like I'm incapable of handling the pressure of a job. Just feel pathetic about it all to be honest. I just don't know what to do. Am I ever going to be able to just do work without being miserable. Took medication which usually helps but not this time. Meant to try and do some work from home but might just sleep it off instead.

Thanks really needed to vent
