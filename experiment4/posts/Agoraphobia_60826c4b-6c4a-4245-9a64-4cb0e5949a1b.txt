left the house today
it’s been months since i last left my house and now, with the whole christmas festivities, i’m in a relative’s house and there’s about ten people here. i’m scared to look away from my phone and don’t know what to do with myself. scared to have a drink because that could make me sick. i’m sitting alone in a corner avoiding everybody. 
i’m not proud of myself, because even though managing do to this should be a huge thing i am not doing great. 
anyways, just wanted to get that out of my chest and typing on my phone makes them think i’m busy texting, so they don’t bother me

my phone battery is dying and i’m freaking out
