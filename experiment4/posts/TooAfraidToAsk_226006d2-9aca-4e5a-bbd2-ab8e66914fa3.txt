Why are people trying to normalize being overweight or obese?
If you make a comment and say someone should lose weight, then you are automatically “fat phobic”. 

My cousin was 23 and a 685 lb male. I didnt make comments about his weight ever but one time in my life, when I saw he couldn’t walk up three steps and was out of breath. 

I told him he needed to start taking his health seriously and I would be a support system for him. I would go on a diet and to the gym right along with him. 

He said he was fine being 600 and that he will lose weight “in the future”

He died last night of a heart attack. 

I don’t get why you’re automatically label as fat phobic or fat shaming or whatever the fuck people jump out and say, just because you don’t agree that’s it’s helpful to encourage obesity and being overweight
