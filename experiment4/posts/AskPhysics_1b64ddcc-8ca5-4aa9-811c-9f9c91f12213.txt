I don't wanna break physics so why doesn't this make infinite energy?
So according to Einstein, mass can be turned into energy. now imagine if you had a cookie, and you had it on the ground with no potential energy. If you made it energy and shot it in the form of light upwards to space with theoretically no energy loss, and you reformed the light to a cookie again... Did I just make potential energy? Now lets say I took the cookie's energy and took it with me back to earth, did I just create energy?  


btw I know creating energy is impossible but I want to know how the universe makes this impossible.
