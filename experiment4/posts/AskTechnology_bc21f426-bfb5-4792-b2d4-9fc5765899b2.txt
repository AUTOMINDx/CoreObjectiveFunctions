Does ram usage contribute to higher internet bill?
So basically my dad all of a sudden asked me to keep a track of my ram usage when browsing the internet, watching YouTube, etc. and when I'm playing video games. It's because he thinks that using more ram and having a higher ram usage, is one of the main things contributing to a higher internet bill. I just thought I'd post a question and see if there is any sort of truth to this, because to me it makes absolutely no sense, also I did some quick research to see if I could find any information and I wasn't able to find a single thing about it.

Thanks.
