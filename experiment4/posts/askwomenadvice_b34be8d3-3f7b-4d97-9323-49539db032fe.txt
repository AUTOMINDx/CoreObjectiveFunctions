How do I (31F) stop worrying and start living life? Struggling
I feel like there are people out there that no matter what they're going through they still find time to go out, have fun, do things for themselves or self care. I feel like I can't do anything for myself. All I can do is worry about my problems. I just left my husband a month ago. I'm trying to figure how to be a single mom again. I'm back living with my mother. I've been struggling to find a job. I finally found one and then I'm dealing with random things going wrong. The washing machine broke, hot water heater broke, I locked my keys in the car. My engine light came on. I don't have a clue how I'm going to fix it . I'm afraid of leaving the house sometimes to even begin doing something nice for myself. It seems like everytime I leave the home,  I'm going to have to spend money. Even somewhere free would require gas money. I can't even bring myself to buy winter clothes for myself. I didn't hesitant to get my kids clothes and coats but I can't do it for myself. My eyebrows look a mess and it would be simple to just stop and go get them done but I can't bring myself to do it either. I just want to live life instead of being stuck thinking about how miserable I am and how I've going to fix all these problems I have. Any suggestions?
