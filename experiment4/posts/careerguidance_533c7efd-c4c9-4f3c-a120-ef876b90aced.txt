I am so fed up with the Graphic Design field and marketing in general. I want out. What can I do?
I hate the graphic design field.

So many people with unreasonable expectations and deadlines. So many bosses who don't give a shit about your time or have any clue what it takes to complete projects.  Not to mention the pay is complete shit for the amount of work effort that is required to be put in. Really, sub $50k to do 5 different job responsibilities? And then you have to factor in that everyone is a critic and wants to throw in their design thoughts and be a backseat designer.

This job is for masochists. I want out. 

I'm just worried all of my skillsets and hobbies I've tried revolve around this. I love drawing and illustrating. I've dabbled in web design and 3D modeling. I love the curiosity and exploration that comes with creativity. I just hate doing it for other people. And this job puts you at the mercy of everybody else.

What are my options? I am turning 35 this year and have a wife and kid that depend on my income contributions. I would go back to school or a trade school if it meant I just had one thing to work on and get reasonably compensated for it. I just don't know what kind of jobs are out there. I'd love to help people if I could. And make it less about staring at a computer all day. I have a Bachelor's degree currently if that helps.

EDIT: After reading the responses here I have looked into switching to a UX designer career path. UX seems way more in tune with what I'd like to do because I'm way more analytical than subjective when it comes to design. I like knowing the "why's" behind everything. Thank you all for the advice.
