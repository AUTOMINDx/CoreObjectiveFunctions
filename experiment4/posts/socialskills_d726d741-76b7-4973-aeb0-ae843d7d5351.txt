How do I make worthwhile and long lasting friendships as a person with low-social energy?
Yesterday and today, I ended two big friendships with people. The reason was that they only talk and give a shit about themselves so much that whenever I finally speak about myself they just go to another conversation. I’m tired of that. I never begin conversations but I don’t want to be so lonely at the same time. I have decent energy when it comes to talking though but i often take breaks from social media. I only have one good friendship as of now. Any recommendations on what I should do to enlarge my social circle?
