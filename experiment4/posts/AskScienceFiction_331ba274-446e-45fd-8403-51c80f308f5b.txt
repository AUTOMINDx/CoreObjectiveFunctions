[Logan] How is the Adamantium skeleton poisoning Wolverine?
After watching Logan, I’ve seen Wolverine talk about how the Adamantium skeleton is poisoning him which worsens his healing factor, but how? Shouldn’t his healing factor take care of the poisoning in the first place? And Wolverine lived for decades with it (He got the Adamantium skeleton back in 1970) and lived with no problem until 2023. After that year he started to age aggressively and become way weaker in the year 2029, all of that in just a span of 6 years?
