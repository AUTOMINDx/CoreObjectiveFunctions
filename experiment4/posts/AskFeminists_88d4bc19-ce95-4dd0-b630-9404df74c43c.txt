Abortion rights &amp; drug use during pregnancy question
Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So I was listening to some of the coverage around the recent court case that is challenge Roe Vs Wade and I heard someone say something I didn't really have a response for:

"How far does the right to privacy go? There was a case out South Carolina where a woman was charged for criminal child neglect because she used cocaine during pregnancy."

The basic logic here is that, if that woman can be charged for use of cocaine, then doesn't any harm to the fetus count as criminal child neglect? ergo, abortion = murder.

&amp;#x200B;

So I really agree with this view. Something about it feels off and I feel like I am missing something obvious, but I'm not totally sure what to say.

  
My response at the moment would probably be something like: But there's a somewhat critical difference here. As far as I know, this woman intended to like give birth to the kid. The kid would then be harmed by that decision. Had she decided to not want to give birth to the kid, then nothing's wrong here. The issue isn't the fetus, it's the long-term effects on the child once born. Decisions made while in the fetal stage effects those long term decisions, but if there isn't a long term because you intend to end the pregnancy then no harm right? This isn't about fetal rights, it's about long-term child rights. So this issue isn't even really about abortion, and thus isn't relevant to this discussion. 

But I feel like that response is lacking for some reason.

So what would you say to this pundit in response? Do you agree with my assessment?

Thanks!
