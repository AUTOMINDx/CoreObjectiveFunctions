Is the Nuclear Family unit anti feminist and if so, should the idea of family be changed or simply the gender roles inside it?
Okay I need something to avoid doing my homework.

So this question has been mulling around in my head.

The nuclear family (Dad and Mom + kids maybe dog) is a thing.  Its actually relatively new history wise.  Only coming around I believe 1800s.  

So is this model itself anti feminist and did it attribute to women's subjugation in modern times or is it simply a product of capitalism atomization (I think that's the critique levied against it) that coincided with oppression.

Also with people wanting to get away from that model will that inherently be helpful to feminist and help people get away from gender roles?
