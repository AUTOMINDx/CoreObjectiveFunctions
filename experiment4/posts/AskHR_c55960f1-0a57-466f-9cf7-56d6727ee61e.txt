[CA] New Security Guard at work is harassing women and management will not do anything about it.
So I work for a fairly big company. They hired a new security guard at my job and there are now 3 reports of this security guard harassing people, one of them being me, and nothing is being done about it. It makes me scared to come to work and makes me extremely uncomfortable. 

The security guard has managed to become buddy-buddy with our boss here and a ton of other employees here, so no one has believed us when we came forward about it because they state “that’s just how he jokes!” or “he didn’t mean that”! 

My boss also will not do anything about it because she says she has no physical proof, she just makes sure that the security guard does not work while we work. But even then, he is still working while we are here and even followed one of the women he harasses to the bathroom earlier this week and waited for her outside of the bathroom.. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve worked for this company for almost two years now, and the other women have worked here for 2+ years. Are we just supposed to find a new job or continue to feel uncomfortable every single day? Am I able to go to HR about this, because my boss told me everything has to go through her. I honestly feel sick to my stomach coming to work every day and seeing him interact with so many of my colleagues who I once saw as friends. It has completely changed my work life.
