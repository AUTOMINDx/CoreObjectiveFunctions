21st century technologies that have exalted cultures?
I’m still just scratching the surface of cultural anthropology, and I’ve encountered much more sources about the negative consequences different technologies have on various cultures. I’m curious about ethnographic examples of technologies that have progressed the ways of life for particular cultural groups, particularly in the 21st century.

Like “ethnotechnology”, I guess, but I don’t know where to learn about that. Is that a thing? Or is there possibly something ill-informed about my curiosity in this?
