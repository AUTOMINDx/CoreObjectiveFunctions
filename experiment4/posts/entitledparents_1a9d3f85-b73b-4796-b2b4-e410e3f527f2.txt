Entitled mother crying in the next room because she didn't get a present she wanted
Title.
It's a fairly normal thing for us in the family to get dad to choose the present and me and my brother just pay for it. We did that but apparently it does not count as a present and now mother is wailing in the bedroom. Got told off by my aunt (why me? isn't by that logic my brother responsible too?) and apparently I ruined Christmas by not buying an extra present.
Bonus round: I'm not close with my family, i try to see them as little as possible - I'm a trans dude and they hate anything queer. The fact that i am willing to give a present to a woman that tells me to "get pregnant and get a boyfriend already" in response to me trying to explain my queerness is already a big thing.
Guess next Christmas I will just spend alone.

Bonus update: Father got her to calm down and talk to him a bit. Turns out she's mad at me because of "how it made her look" to get only one present and because I did not wear a "proper dress".
