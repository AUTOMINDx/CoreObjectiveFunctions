over 2 years of dealing with this, it's hard not to feel hopeless/frustrated/exhausted
been dealing with acid reflux and gastritis for over 2 years, had a really bad flare-up in august where my symptoms got a lot worse. been trying ever since to recover. with drugs and a super bland diet, i'm very, very slowly getting better, it's just taking so long. talked to several docs and had a couple procedures and i believe i'm on the right course of action to getting better, just gotta "ride the wave out" as my doc says. but i know that will take weeks and months to get back to any sort of normal.

i'm only 26. i'm just tired of not being able to eat hardly anything. i'm tired of being in pain all the time. i'm tired of not being able to fall asleep because of the pain. this disease is just so mentally and physically draining. does anyone have any tips on how to make this easier while i slowly heal?
