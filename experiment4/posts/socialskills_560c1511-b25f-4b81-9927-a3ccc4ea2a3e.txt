I have been rejected today. Here‘s how I deal with it!
So, like the title says I have been rejected by my crush.

Did it hurt? Yes it did 100%, but I have some strategies to forget about it.

Every time I get rejected I start to feel like shit and worthless. I start to cry and get suicidal thoughts. But you dont have to worry about it. I feel this way after every rejection.

So, how do I deal with a rejection?

I hang out with my friends. Your friends are people who you trust and have fun with. Go ahead and make plans and have fun. Be thankful that you still have great friends. It will change your mood positively.

Another thing I do after getting rejected is to treat myself with compliments. Just remember many men are afraid of rejection and never shoot their shot. So if you are asking your crush out you should be proud of yourself, because not everyone can do this. This boosts my confidence slightly.

One more thing I do is to release my emotions by crying. This might sound weird, but crying makes me feel alot better. The pressure and pain disappears and the more I cry the less you will care about the rejection. So go ahead and release your emotions.

These are my 3 favorite things to do after a rejection.

I have an advice for everyone who‘s afraid of being rejected.

Would you rather avoid asking your crush out and live with regret for many months or even years or would you ask your crush out with the risk being rejected and have a broken heart, which won‘t last as long as regret.

Shoot your shot or you will regret it. And remember after every rejection you will notice some improvements.

Good luck!
