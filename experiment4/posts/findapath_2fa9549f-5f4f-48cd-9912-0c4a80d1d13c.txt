Movie Suggestion: Kiki's Delivery Service
This is a feel good movie about a young witch moving to a new city and starting a life there. I loved it as a kid, and now it is my go to movie when I am feeling lost in life.

It is a simplified but also realistic version of the ups and downs of taking control of your life. It shows the mundane side of the dream, the daily hustles, how luck is always a factor etc. It makes me feel like it is okay for things to not feel perfect at the moment, that I might just as well be in the middle part of my movie. It is a memorable experience. So if you haven't yet, I highly recommend it. 

Note: Some dialouge in the movie can also be comforting or eye opening for the artist types as well.
