[TN] Cobra Eligibility Help
My husband’s 60 day COBRA eligibility runs out on December 6th. On November 19 he was life flighted (helicopter ambulance) to the hospital with a ruptured appendix and septic shock. He is still in the ICU but thankfully, he is stable. I have been trying to reach his former HR department via phone and email for help getting his COBRA coverage activated but no one is responding to me. Is there a way I can ensure his coverage without them? What do I do if his window closes and they haven’t gotten back to me? Without coverage we are currently looking at about $600,000 in medical bills and it is continuing to grow. He needs his coverage. Thank you for any advice or guidance you can give.
