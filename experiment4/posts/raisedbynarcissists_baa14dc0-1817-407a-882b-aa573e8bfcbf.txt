It isn't difficult to love you.
When I'm depressed or need to talk, so often I find myself saying to my partner:
"I'm so sorry you have to deal with me when I'm like this" 
"Thank you for being so kind to me"
"I know it must be so hard to sit through me talking through these things all the time"
"I really appreciate you listening to me"
"Thank you for loving me"
To which he is always baffled. Why on earth should it be hard to simply be there for the one you love? He asks me how I would feel if he showered me with thank yous and apologies if he came to me in a time of need. I'm taken aback by how sad I would feel by that.


He says something I wanted to extend to anyone else who needs to hear it, who maybe doesn't yet have someone in their life who told them this:


"It isn't difficult to love you."


Our nparents made us feel as if loving us was the most torturous feat in the world. That we were so unlovable, we were born in a deficit that we had to make up to them. For burdening them with the responsibility of a life we did not even choose. That in order to earn the bare minimum, what any child should expect from a parent, we had to meet standards that were set higher and higher every time we were allowed to feel in reach. That our one goal in life was to appease the un-appease-able.


THAT is difficult. In fact calling it merely difficult seems like an insult. To be a child chasing the love that could never exist within such a person. To be a child with said person as their parent, trying to survive the rest of their teen and adult lives picking up the pieces of themselves, without even having been given the tools to know how to mend them.


No, it is not difficult to love you. It never was.
It was always them.
