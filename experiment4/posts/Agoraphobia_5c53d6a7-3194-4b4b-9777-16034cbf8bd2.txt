Is anyone else happy?
Are you happy living with agoraphobia? I’m the happiest I’ve been in my entire life since the pandemic hit. I was prepared for this. It was like training for a marathon of staying home. Of course I don’t like covid or losing loved ones or worrying about getting sick, but I get my kids home with me. I know they’re safe. I can’t drive, I can barely sit in a car without panicking, but home is my happy place. I can make it what I want it to be. I have control here. I feel really offended when people say I need to go to work, because why is my happiness and feeling of security worth sacrificing For what? To get treated terribly by customers, coworkers, and managers? I just got off the phone with a friend, and I just feel like no one understands and I was wondering if it’s possible to be happy this way and if it’s okay that I’m happy living like this?
