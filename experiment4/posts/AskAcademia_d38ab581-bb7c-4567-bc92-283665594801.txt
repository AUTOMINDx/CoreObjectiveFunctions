Gift for my Professor who changed my life.
I want to give an RBG bobble head to my Professor who has impacted me so much. She has championed for me, and given me great opportunities as being her TA and a scholarship. I want to give her a gift for winter break, so I got her an RBG bobble head, as she is a feminist activist and a lawyer. But I don’t want to cross any boundaries or make her uncomfortable. I know there is some policy that professors can’t accept gifts, or overall some professors get uncomfortable. 

I have a nice, but cheap candle that I can give her as a second option. What do you think?
