Should I resign?
I am 23 and this is my 3rd job so far. I work as an ERP Consultant. I think among all the jobs I've had, I enjoy this one the most. However, there is too much workload and too much stress. I think my company has a staff problem that they cope up by overworking their staffs. The basis of performance is also time based so I find myself working overtime most of the days and without pay just so I could have enough billable hours. The pay in this field is quite good and I am thankful really. There is also much career growth. It's just I find myself breaking down during work hours and if not, most of the time I cry after work. These days I do not have time for myself and the things I enjoy cause I am still working more than 8 hours and it is unpaid. Even when I am resting, I get anxious about my work. Should I resign? I've only been in here for 1 year. Would it look bad for my resume if most of jobs I've only stayed for 1 year or less... Should I just find other company with the same field? I am afraid that it is really like this when it comes to this field and maybe I am not suited for it... Thanks I would really appreciate anything
