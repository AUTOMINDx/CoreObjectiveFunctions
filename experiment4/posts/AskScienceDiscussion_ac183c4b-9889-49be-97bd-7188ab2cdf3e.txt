Can you have H- in a proton beam?
So I work at a cyclotron and we accelerate H- and strip the electrons with a carbon foil. The stripped protons then bend to the beam pipe and hit the target.

Can a H or H- atom end up traveling with the beam of protons? I would assume not since its charge is opposite/neutral and thus would not bend the same through the magnets. My engineering coworker says they can from momentum, but he is very much not scientific. 

Hopefully this question makes sense.
