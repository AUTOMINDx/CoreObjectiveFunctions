Why make friends if they all leave in the end?
I feel very sad about parting with friends. From the start of the year, I'll be feeling it, even when I'm just with people I'm only starting to try to befriend. Why bother making friends if they're gonna go so soon? Currently I have some friends who are focusing in different fields from myself. We'll be together for two years (assuming they stay in this school till the end), and then they'll go into university. Uni here is split by fields so we will not be together anymore.

I don't feel like investing in relationships that will end so soon... I know we can keep contact online to some extent (maybe), but mostly online communication isn't very satisfying.

I don't want to love anybody because I don't want to grieve their loss. That sounds extreme because they're not passing away or anything but it's how I feel.

Perhaps this is could partly be an 'attachment style' issue?
