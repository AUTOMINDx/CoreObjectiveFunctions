Commemorating the Upcoming 107-Year Anniversary of the Battle of the Falkland Islands - December 8, 1914
If you enjoy history, you may already know that the 'Dreadnought' era of modern battleships began with HMS Dreadnought in 1906, but many of you may not know of the watershed moment when the advance in technology that the Dreadnought represented finally overcame the human factor in naval combat for the first time in history. Throughout naval history - at Salamis, at Trafalgar, it was frequently skill, morale, courage, Ã©lan that decided battles and overcame odds - until the Battle of the Falkland Islands on December 8, 1914. 

To give you the short version, the German East Asia Cruiser Squadron at the outbreak of the First World War boasted two of the very last generation of pre-dreadnought armored cruisers - SMS Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, along with three light cruisers, and were crewed by the very finest sailors the Imperial German Navy had to offer, having won the Kaiser's Cup for gunnery multiple times, and commanded by a fine leader in Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee. 

At the Battle of Coronel on November 1, 1914, the Squadron rather easily destroyed two British armored cruisers, demonstrating their superiority over technologically comparable foes by superior tactics and gunnery. In response, the British Admiralty sent two new dreadnought-type battle cruisers, HMS Invincible and Inflexible, to hunt the Squadron. The battle cruisers were dispatched hastily and largely crewed with reservists. By sheer bad luck, von Spee's attempt to raid the Falklands coincided with the battle cruisers' arrival there, and they gave chase, with battle taking place finally on the edge of the Antarctic circle. 

Upon realizing the superior dreadnought speed left no chance of escape, and demonstrating superb gallantry, the Vice Admiral led his two armored cruisers directly at the enemy in an attempt to draw attention from his escorts as they tried to escape. Despite scoring repeated hits on the battle cruisers, their heavier armor prevented almost all damage from the armored cruisers' gunnery. Using superior tactics, von Spee tried to close the range but was frustrated again by the battle cruisers' speed as they refused to allow it. Even though their own gunnery was poor due to inexperience, the heavier shells of the British ships took their toll, if slowly, and it took hours to finally destroy the German ships. The Vice Admiral and his two sons were among the 1,500 dead. So great was the morale of the German sailors that legend tells of a sailor standing on the overturned keel of one of the sinking German cruisers, waving the flag defiantly as it sank beneath him. 

In the end, superior skill, training, morale, tactics, and leadership meant nothing to the outcome of the battle - for the first time in naval history, technology simply crushed all of those factors under its weight, and it would never give up that advantage again, as the rise of air power would decisively show only a few decades later.

"I deeply regret the needless sacrifice of so many lives by an enemy who displayed such bravery, skill, and endurance; after the ships were defeated and sinking and in no position to make any further defence, they did not surrender." - Sir Doveton Sturdee, British commander at the Battle of the Falkland Islands
