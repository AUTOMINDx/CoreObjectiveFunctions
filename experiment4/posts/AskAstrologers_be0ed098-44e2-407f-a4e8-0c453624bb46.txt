Anyone else feel an immense sense of luck upon digging deep into astrology?
Pretty much the title.

I’ve always known my sun sign.

I got to know my rising &amp;amp;amp; moon a little over a year ago (hello the beginning of my Saturn return).

Within the past few months, I decided to look into astrology again. I also realized that I made a typo in the birth chart screenshots I was basing everything off of. (One had the time off by an hour which changed my moon; the other chart had the right time but the wrong day which didn’t change much but let’s just say attention to detail isn’t my thing.

Once I corrected my data, I started digging deep and now I’m listening to tons of podcasts at 2x speed and I’m doing natal chart readings with my family just to get a solid baseline self-education...

That, along with just having *good* placements that have really helped my mood and confidence… and libido for life!

I feel like I’m being rewarded for waking up when I have.

Anyone go through anything similar?
