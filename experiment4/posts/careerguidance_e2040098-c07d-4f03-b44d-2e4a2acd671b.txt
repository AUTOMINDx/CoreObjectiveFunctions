How to explain to my boss I want a raise now, not in 10months?
So I've been working as a graduate engineer for 2yr 3mo and when I started I was told I would be promoted around the 2 year mark. At around this time I questioned why I hadnt yet been promoted and they insisted I've been doing well at the company but only promote people in July (I asked in August)... So they basically said you have to wait another whole year to get promoted. 

They also said the requirements for this first promotion are very limited you only need to really work there for 2 years and pretty much have always gotten it, but have blamed the delay this year on corporate saying they can only do promotions in July. 

Recently we have hired about 30 people in an office of what was 100 so I find it pretty annoying that I'm still here on my starting salary, and am gonna ask again in my appraisal, and when they decline again I think I will start actively looking for another company. Does this seem reasonable?
