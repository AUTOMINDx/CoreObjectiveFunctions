i’m (f 23) envious of women who have big breasts. how can i get over this?
i honestly need help/advice with this. i’m average looking, and i’m a cup size a. i hate how i feel about being envious of women who have big boobs, like, i know it’s all about being palatable to the male gaze (and i HATE whetting the palate of the male gaze) but i rly rly rly can’t help but feel bad about not being well-endowed. thoughts?

Edit: wow, i didn’t expect this to blow up. thanks for the well wishes, everyone! i feel tremendously better while reading your comments.
