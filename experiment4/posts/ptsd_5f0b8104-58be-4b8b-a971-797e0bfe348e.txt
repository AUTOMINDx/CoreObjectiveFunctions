How do I tell my partner that the licking sounds his dog makes triggers flashbacks and intrusive thoughts?
Petite TRIGGER WARNING 







please bear with me ): I’ve been silent about it forever but this morning I had to leave in a panic. Most of my ptsd comes from tape and sexual assault, in one particular instance I was asleep, and now whenever I’ve been waking up hearing this dog lick himself I get thrown into a different state of mind. I don’t know what to do…is this even something I bring up or should I keep working on this myself? 

Any similar experience/mechanism to get through is welcomed. I really don’t know how to go about this; it feels like it’s not big deal but I know I’m invalidating myself..








Edit: shocked to see people still assume anyone with ptsd hasn’t taken the time to work on themselves. Maybe they should take the time to work on themselves… 

Thanks y’all for commenting, I spoke to him about it and he was completely understanding. He doesn’t mind moving the dogs out of the room when we sleep; he’s wanted to move them out of his room anyway to keep the fur and doge smell out, so it all works out (:
