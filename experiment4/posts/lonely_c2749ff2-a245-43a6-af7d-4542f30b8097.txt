With all due respect, some of you are annoying
With the sheer amount of lonely/depressed people on this app i’d figure some of you would want to actually talk to one another and help each other out with your problems, yet 90% of everyones posts lack any significant interaction from others

Then i see a post with “F19” on it and all of a sudden you guys come out from the fucking bushes and line up one by one begging for an opportunity to DM a girl. 

Be better. That shit is so annoying
