Vegetables and fruits
Does anyone else have a HORRIBLE time digesting them? I’ve pretty much given up on them since I’m in such a bad flare up. Also recently had gallbladder removed. Any recs for supplements for issues with this? I’ve tried protein shakes with greens added and I can’t digest that either. I had a strawberry banana smoothie earlier and that seemed to sit okay. Just starting to stress about my little to no vegetable consumption lolz
