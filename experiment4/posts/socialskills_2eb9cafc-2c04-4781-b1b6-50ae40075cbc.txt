I hate social media
I lowkey hate social media. I’m a kid and I have grown up with it and don’t get me wrong there is interesting stuff on it. But god sometimes I wish it didn’t exits. 

When I like someone, I hate if they don’t follow me back, or I see them post something with someone else.

Sometimes I wish social media didn’t exist because then I could actually get to know a girl for who she is instead of judging her off of social media. Also if she leaves me on opened on Snapchat or doesn’t follow me back on insta, I don’t have to stress over it and think she hates me.
