Leaving PhD in the US and moving to Japan?
I am PhD student at a US university (QS ranking&gt;500). I have completed my 2 years here. I am thinking to quit the PhD here and move to the University of Tokyo. The reason behind this is my PhD advisor, his lack of supervision and biasedness towards other students has compelled me to do this. I feel discouraged and demotivated most of the time.

I have talked with one professor from the University of Tokyo, he is happy to take me. He is a renowned person with a lot of research papers and citations.

Do you think leaving the US and moving to Japan is a good idea? Many of my friends think that the US has better opportunities, but the Univ of Tokyo is one of the best world universities. Do you think PhD degree from the best Japanese university holds some value? 

PS I am not a US citizen.
