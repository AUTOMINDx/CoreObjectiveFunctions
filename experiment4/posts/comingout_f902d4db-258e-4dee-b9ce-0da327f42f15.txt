For a long time I thought I disliked trans people.
Aye, brand new redditor here. When I was a 16yo lad one of my friends came out as a trans guy. I still liked him but I somehow felt it was super weird and dumb that he'd do that. Either way, I tried to accept him. It was my first real experience with trans issues of any kind, and it felt wrong even though I've always conciously tried to be a very open minded, "live and let live" type of person.

Soon after that school ended and our paths separated. I've really not heard of him since, but for a good while him coming out left a weird feeling in me. I couldn't help but feel I hadn't been the best friend I could have, while simultaneously I regretted not telling him that I felt he was being just a dumb and emotional teenager.

Now about 5 years and multiple experiences with trans issues later I've finally figured out and accepted the problem I had with him: I couldn't comprehend why anyone would ever want to be a man if they had the choice of being a woman instead. It baffled me that some people actually don't want to be women, and I just thought no man was supposed to like being a man. Let alone, come out as one.

So uh, long story short, in the last 6 months I've come out to all my friends and family, legally changed my name and I'm supposed to be starting HRT in the coming spring. And I'm very excited!
