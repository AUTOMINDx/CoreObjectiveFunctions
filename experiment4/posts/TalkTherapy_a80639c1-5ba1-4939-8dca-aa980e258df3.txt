My wife just went to a therapist who sold her some bach florals claiming to improve self love and im really pissed off.
The title makes it fast. My wife is looking for a therapist and she just went to one that in the first session sold her a bach flower remedy claiming it would improve her self love and general mood. The therapist also told she will be using other floral mixes during the treatment and i was really pissed off with that, i dont know if im overreacting but how can a "professional" claim something like this? Is this something normal or legit from a therapist? Im really concerned of the therapist earning comission from the pharma for selling these prodcuts to patients.

I would love to know if this is normal and even acceptable.
