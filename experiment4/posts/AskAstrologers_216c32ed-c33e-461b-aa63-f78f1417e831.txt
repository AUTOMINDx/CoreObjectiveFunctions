All negative stuff aside what would you say was the “best “ month of 2021 for you and why ??
I’ll start with mine and I will Say February that month had some hard stuff but as a whole it was the best month this whole year had to offer for a wide variety of reasons the positive things that month felt like a sneak peak of what’s to come in the future a reminder that things can get better that it isn’t always gonna be this grim and dark I think that’s why I’ll say that it was the “best “ month of the entire year

 I think May would be the 2nd best month mostly because of that Jupiter in Pisces ingress and a temporary relief from the heaviness and chaos for a few weeks it felt good to have a respite for a moment
