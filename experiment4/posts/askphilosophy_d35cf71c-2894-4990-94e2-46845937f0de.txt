Same-sex relationships and Utilitarianism
Hi all, I am writing a research paper in support of homosexuality or same-sex relationships through a Utilitarian perspective. My argument is that same-sex relationships can provide the same utility as opposite-sex relationships. Also, trying to force one to conform to one sexuality or identity increases pain instead of utility. I have been researching to see what would be a common objection to this view and how would I respond to it as a Utilitarian but had no luck finding any? If anyone has some suggestions, please feel free to share :) 

Thank you!
