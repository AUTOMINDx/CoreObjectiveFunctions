Drinking after vaxx?
Hello. Today I should be getting my 2nd dose (Astra Zeneca). However tonight I also planned to drink a bit (about a bottle of wine mixed for some nice coke). Is that dangerous, could it lead to any health issues or something?

Me: 25M, smoker, 80ish kg 178cm (automod requiring this info sooo)

EDIT: COKE IS COCA COLA, MIXED WITH WINE. I don't like drinking wine alone. I do not and will not snort cocaine. Lol
