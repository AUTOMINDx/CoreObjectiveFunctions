Did humans really never boil water to make it potable until modern times?
The common conception is humans never intentionally boiled water to prevent illness until after germ theory was developed in the 1800's. Given the amazing ability for discovery, creativity and innovation that humans exhibited for so many other things (natural medications, developing iron tools, writing, etc.,) is it really probable that no culture, at any time in history, definitively knew boiling water made it safe to drink? 

Of course, it's *possible*, but I actually do mean likely or *probable*.
