Can’t enjoy Christmas with fear of sick child. Can someone please look at his labs?
Hello. 



My son is 1 year old. 21 LBS. Caucasian. No prior health issues. 






At his 10 month appointment he was flagged for low iron. As a follow up at his 12 month appointment he was retested. His values look off, and more importantly his white blood cell count and lymphs are flagged. Everything on the Internet says childhood cancer (Leukemia). I can’t talk to the doctor because they are closed until Monday for Christmas. 









I would note that he received the MMR vaccine at his appointment, which caused a high fever a week later for two days. On the second day was when we took him for the iron retest. Not sure if that could cause it.
