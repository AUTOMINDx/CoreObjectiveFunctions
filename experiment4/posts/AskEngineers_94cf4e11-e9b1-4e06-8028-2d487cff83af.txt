Should I continue on intervening with a company after finding out their salary isn’t anywhere near COL?
So I was looking for a new engineering gig next year. I dislike like my current role with a passion. I threw a ton of applications to the wind and just sat back. 

The first place that responded was in San Diego. Never been there tbh but, heard it’s hell expensive. I did the first interview after a recruiter called me out of the blue. After passing and getting a second final set of interviews I went home and did a Google search of the salary. 

It’s about 90k issue is that I make about that much where I’m at now (middle cost of living area). 

The next set of interviews are technical questions. 

Should I go through with this interview for practice? They’d have to pay me the COL percent difference for me to take the job for me to even consider it so I know that I’m not gonna take this job.  

But will that look bad for a young engineer? I’m one year of college and not trying to burn bridges this quickly in the industry.
