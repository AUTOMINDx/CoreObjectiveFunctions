Really nervous to talk to my therapist about some body dysphoria stuff?
My therapist is the sweetest woman ever. We have a very good relationship. Lately I’ve been struggling with gender expression. Some days I feel more feminine, other days more androgynous. The days I feel more androgynous, I would prefer my chest to be flat. I’m small chested as it is but trying to wear sports bras or bigger shirts don’t seem to hide them. I have considered for quite a while getting a binder but I can’t get myself to do it. My therapist suggested yesterday keeping a journal of my thoughts and feelings because I have a hard time identifying feelings (I see her for an eating disorder and anxiety). She is very LGBT positive and supportive so I know it won’t be an issue for her and she will support me… I’ve just never told anybody about this stuff. I wrote about it in the journal and she will read it next week Tuesday. I keep thinking about taking the page out and not talking about it… but I also think talking about it will help me a lot mentally. I don’t really know what to do.
