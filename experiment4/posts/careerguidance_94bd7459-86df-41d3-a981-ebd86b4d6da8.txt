How have you overcome burnout?
Location wi.  I was a manager for a company whose business model was to run short-staffed.   As a manager, I was denied resources repeatedly.   Replacing existing employees were denied to dragged out for months, not allowed to hire temps or auth overtime for remaining staff when employees out on long term FMLA.  

Left that job months ago but the burnout I felt was deep and is longer lasting than I could have imagined.    After leaving that job I was unemployed for about 3 months  when I tried to focus on my mental health and see a therapist.  I found a new job that is a lower level position where I don't manage any employees or budget.  It's much less stressful and I took a big pay cut to make sure I went to a job less stressful.   

As with any job, there is some stress.   I should be able to handle it.   I'm finding that I mentally shut down when something stressful or challenging arises.  I am struggling to focus and get through work.    How have you gotten over long term burnout?  How long did it take you?  Has it impacted your ability to even do regular work?

Edit.   Thank you so much for the responses.   I am touched you reached out.   It's very sad that this has happened to us.   It sure sounds like this is going to take a long time to get over and a lot of retraining of my brain to set boundaries and reconnecting with people who drifted away when I shut down due to stress.   You all lifted my spirits today
