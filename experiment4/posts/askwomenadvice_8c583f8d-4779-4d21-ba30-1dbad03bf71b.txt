I’m feeling very uncomfortable with basic bodily functions/being human.
I’m (25F) not sure where to post this but maybe some other women have been in my shoes at some point. I’ve been struggling with these thoughts a lot lately. 

I’m uncomfortable with bodily functions. Like when I go to the grocery store, I see everyone buying food, and I can’t help but think about how weird it is that we all eat and we all poop. Anytime I meet someone I think about how they use the bathroom. Or have sex. Sex is fucking weird. Pooping is fucking weird. Eating is fucking weird. At this point I don’t like eating alone in public because my mind goes straight to how I’ll have to “release waste” later in the day and that other people around me are aware of it. I know they don’t give a shit (literally) but I do. Anytime my coworkers and I have a zoom call, I find myself thinking about it.

When I’m with close girl friends this isn’t an issue, but recently I’ve been spending a lot more time alone. I’ve stopped dating. I live alone. I try to tell myself that these are normal bodily functions that every species participates in but it doesn’t really make it any better for me. 

My thoughts are becoming more and more intrusive. Has anyone else dealt with this? Like what the fuck is wrong with me? I don’t want to imagine someone on the toilet or having sex any time I meet them :/ this is super embarrassing to even talk about.
