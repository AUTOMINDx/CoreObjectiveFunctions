Dag Hammarskjöld, 2nd Secretary General of the United Nations, was very likely assassinated by the USA, Britain, and Belgium - in 1961 his airplane shot down on the way to negotiate a cease-fire in the Congo. Why hasn't this conspiracy received more attention?
I was surprised to find only *one* [(10 year old) post](https://old.reddit.com/r/history/comments/jlw2s/new_evidence_indicates_un_chief_dag_hammarskj%C3%B6lds/) in this sub about Hammarskjöld, let alone about his extremely suspicious death, so I figured it was time to bring this to the attention of others, since this is **nuts.** Perhaps the craziest thing I've ever stumbled upon... I only started out trying to memorize UN Secretary Generals, and now I'm learning about potentially one of the highest-profile assassinations ever done by intelligence agencies. I wonder why this hasn't caught more attention (if we can judge by the number of mentions on reddit in a decade)?

Plenty to read up on. The [UN is conducting another investigation due to complete in 2022](https://consortiumnews.com/2021/09/25/watch-the-un-inquiry-into-hammarskjolds-death-last-chance-to-reach-the-truth/).

[The Guardian published an article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/dag-hammarskjold-plane-shot-down-mercenary-cable) which claimed that an American NSA employee, former naval pilot Commander Charles Southall, working at the NSA listening station in Cyprus in 1961 shortly after midnight on the night of the crash, heard an intercept of a pilot's commentary in the air over Ndola, 5,300 km (3,300 mi)[29] away. Southall recalled the pilot saying: "I see a transport plane coming low. All the lights are on. I'm going down to make a run on it. Yes, it is the Transair DC-6. It's the plane," adding that his voice was "cool and professional". Then he heard the sound of gunfire and the pilot exclaiming: "I've hit it. There are flames! It's going down. It's crashing!"

Here's the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Ndola_United_Nations_DC-6_crash) which I quoted from to reference the Guardian article.
