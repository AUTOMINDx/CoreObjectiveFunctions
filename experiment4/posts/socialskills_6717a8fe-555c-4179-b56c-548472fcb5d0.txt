I have literally no desire to have friends
I don't know what happened to me in the pandemic but I just don't care about having friends anymore. All they do is disappoint you. I'm in my late 20s so friend groups aren't really even a thing, and if they are it's not based in support or coming up in career and the same time, it's based on out-doing each other and keeping up with the Joneses. Not sure what the solution is. I used to have friends and slowly stopped talking to them because they all just get married and move away. Do I even need friends as a real adult?
