I started dating someone who doesn't care for drinking, and this has led to far superior dates overall.
I (26m) started seeing someone recently who doesn't enjoy drinking. She told me this while we were texting on Hinge, and suggested that for our first date we go bowling rather than getting drinks or dinner.

This resulted in one of the most fun evenings I've had getting to know someone for the first time! We only played two full rounds that night, but getting into light competition allowed us to exchange fun banter and reveal more about ourselves than what might've come out over booze and a meal.

We followed that up with a second coffee date on Saturday at a board game caf√© in her hometown. Having a variety of different games at our disposal kept the competition going further. Debating strategy over *Blockus*, *Uno*, and even *Jenga* taught me more about the way she thinks than happy hour cocktails over could. She was enthralled with the idea of showing me the grandiose Christmas displays in her neighborhood, and even more so when I got her hints to make a move on her while walking through a nearby park.

A third date is in the works as I plan to show her the even more grandiose Christmas displays in the big city over the weekend. 

To prevent myself from ranting further, I would strongly recommend trying something other than dinner or drinks when meeting someone for a first date. Activities can allow you to see how your date interacts with others and the world around them. That, in turn, can open up possibilities for banter or other meaningful conversations which you might not get when idling in the same spot for multiple hours.
