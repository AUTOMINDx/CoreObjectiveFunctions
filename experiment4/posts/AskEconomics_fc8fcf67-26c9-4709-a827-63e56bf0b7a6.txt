If inflation remains high does that mean interest rates will have to rise?
say 7% inflation becomes the norm for the next few years. In my mind theres no reason people would be loaning out money for less than inflation, so interest rates would have to rise. The government could print money to buy their own bonds but that would only make the inflation problem worse. So once the gov stops buying bonds I would expect bond rates to rise to at least the current rate of inflation. Am I understanding this correctly? Who would be loaning money out at less than the inflation rate?
