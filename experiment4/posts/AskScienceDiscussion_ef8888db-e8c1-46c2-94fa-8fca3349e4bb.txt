We need to destroy the earth. what is the easiest method of doing so?
For whatever reason humanity has decided the Earth has got to go. Not just life, the entire planet. At the very least it must be split in two, cracked like an egg. If the two pieces eventually form another planet, that's OK. What would be the easiest means of accomplishing this? Destroying the entire solar system if necessary is totally on the table if the easiest means is making the sun explode or something.
