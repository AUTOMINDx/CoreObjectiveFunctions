Growing up... do you remember having actual ambition past graduating and getting to move out? Hear me out...
I hear so many people say that they “always wanted to be....” or at least know an industry they liked. or even when in the workforce wanting to climb the ladder to jobs I didn’t know exist. Or I know ppl that “always wanted to be a mom/dad”

But truly when I think about growing up I literally had no ambition like that. I didn’t think I could create anything good in life. It was more like, “whatever I have to do to not be here.” Does anyone relate? 

In the end I’m blessed with an awesome life but I totally lucked into it.
