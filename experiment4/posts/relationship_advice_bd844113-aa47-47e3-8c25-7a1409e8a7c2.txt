My (27M) girlfriend (28F) only wants boys and will not go through with any pregnancy if she finds out the child is a girl.
We have been dating for a year and half. We had a pregnancy scare last week. She is not pregnant. we were relieved but also slightly disappointed. We were talking about the topics of children and the subject of gender came up. I don't care about gender.

 She said she only wanted boys and didn't want girls. I understand having a preference but this sounds really extreme so I asked what she would do if the baby turned out to be a girl. She said she would get an abortion. 

we ended the conversation as I really didn't know what to say to that. I have been thinking about it and I am really worried. I am worried if she will be a good parent to any child frankly. I just don't understand it. 

 She has a  terrible relationship with her mother and I think some of her reluctance may stem from that. I just don't know how to deal with this and talk about it. She hates talking about her mother and I think this will be a very hard topic to discuss. I need some advice on how to handle this sensitively. 

TLDR : Girlfriend said she will get an abortion if the baby turns to be a girl. I need advice to talk about it.
