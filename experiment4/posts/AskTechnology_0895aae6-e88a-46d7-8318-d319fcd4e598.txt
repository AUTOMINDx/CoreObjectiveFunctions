DisplayPort / HDMI splitter for 3440x1440 144hz Monitor and 4K 60HZ TV?
Hello,

With  my PC being in an awkward position and my TV and Monitor being finicky  when both connected to my GPU at the same time, I'm looking for  something I can use to switch from using my DisplayPort and HDMI  connections easily, without impacting performance or response times.

I  think they're called Switches or Splitters or KVMs? But I'm having  trouble finding what I'm looking for, or even finding out if something  like this even exists?

Here's the type of thing I'm looking for.

Thanks for anyone who can point me into the direction of what I'm looking for here.
