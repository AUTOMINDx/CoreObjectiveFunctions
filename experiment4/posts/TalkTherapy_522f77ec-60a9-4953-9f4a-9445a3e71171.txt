Do you ever wonder if some of these posts are real?
I’ve been on the sub I guess off/on for almost a year, and every time I come back I see these posts about therapists from I guess all over the world who say shocking things and do things that range from mildly inappropriate to highly unethical. Just seems like I see more and more of these posts.

Maybe most or all are legit. Maybe some of them are from an inaccurate perspective. I just can’t seem to understand how these therapists in these posts are still licensed.

I must be really lucky. Mine is wonderful and has helped me with my growth so much this year.
