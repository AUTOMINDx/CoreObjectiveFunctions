What silly/funny layperson words have you managed to sneak into reports?
As engineers, we write tens of thousands of report throughout our career. To keep my sanity, I make it a habit of putting in goofed up words into normal sentences that no one in their right minds would use. Tell me some samples you've used and did you get away with it?

I work in building restoration and forensics, I just used the word "shrubbery" and "herring" on one paragraph apart.
