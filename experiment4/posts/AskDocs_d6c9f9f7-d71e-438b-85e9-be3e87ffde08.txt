Hello everyone, i need your help to know the survival rate here. (My gf is in critical condition admitted to a hospital).
(sorry English isn't my first lang)
So, my gf caught "Dengue" A few days back and she got admitted to hospital. Me and my gf live long distance and the only way for me to know what is happening her texting me about what is happening. So few days back she had dengue and was admitted to a hospital, she said they are giving blood...

So today i got a call from her that she is in a critical condition and her platelet count is going down day by day and doctors are transfusing platelets to her(i don't how to say this) and her current platelet count is 4000, so she said the doctors are saying "she is critical and we have to wait and see".

Till now this is the info i know, so please can anyone tell me will she survive i am really scared me and my gf are of same age 18.

Please anyone tell me what is happening there i can't understand...

Thank you.

EDIT: My gf is talking very well in calls right now, however her platelet count hasnt improved but the way she is talking seems like she will get through it and i hope she does...

EDIT 2- SHE  is in critical condition shifted to another hospital in another city it's by far the biggest one so doctors said we just have to hope that she gets better.ðŸ˜•

EDIT 3- HER platelets count fell to 600(not 6 misheard on phone) , doctors say that they are trying their best..

EDIT 4- her platelets are fluctuating ......they are running some test called as "blood culture test".

EDIT 5 - her condition got very serious yesterday night and doctors were transmitting hemoglobin to her.

EDIT 6- She got a test and doctors said that she have an ITP Disease (a disease in which the immune system kills her own platelets).

EDIT 7- her platelets came back to 21k yuhuuuu she is getting normal as far as i know ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ thank godd.
