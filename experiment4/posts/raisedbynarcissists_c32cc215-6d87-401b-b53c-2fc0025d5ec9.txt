my mom is crying.
I got my marks in science today,I got 33/40 and now my mom is crying and telling me how much of a failure i am and my dadâ€™s telling me to die and that he will make me dropout of school,i have been bad in science since i was a kid,but they just donâ€™t seem to accept it,they keep demotivating me to the point i have no confidence in myself i hate it here sm. Is this normal?
