Does Anybody Else View Money As Happiness?
As both a Pharmacy Technician and now a Medical Assistant, I haven’t ever even made $30K a year. I’m sitting at most $24K a year before taxes. And at both of these jobs I get pushed around and micromanaged, and treated like I don’t know what I’m doing. That’s why I view money as happiness. If I had a job that paid $100K a year, I could live a happy life, regardless of how I was treated at work. At least I’d have money to compensate for it. But it seems like every job that pays so much has unrealistic expectations and are impossible to get into and do. So I’m just living my life chasing a number, but I know that would make me happy. And don’t say that money wouldn’t make me happy. I know what I want. Does anybody have any advice on how I can make a lot of money, or at least have a job where I get treated nicely?
