[FL] Quit a job after 4 hours due to my new boss making me feel very uncomfortable, was never paid. Is it worth it to reach out?
Basically I was brought into a new company about a month ago, signed offer letter, filled out tax forms, etc. on my first day, my boss didn’t even have a desk for me or someone for me to sit. He pulls up a chair next to him at his desk. I assumed we would be doing some training and shadowing but instead he spends the next 4 hours telling me about how spent the night before, about his girlfriend and his kids, showing me pictures on his phone of a party he went to, a video of some older man giving a lap dance to a woman and asking me about my relationship status and if I had kids. He even joked about the only thing from college he got was syphilis. 

I was trying to stick it out until he insisted that he and I go to lunch together and when I said I needed to make some calls and he said no, take the calls before we go and then we’ll go to hooters. Luckily I had just experienced a death in a family so I used that as an excuse for the calls being private and I left. I didn’t ever go back and expected a paper check to arrive on their payday and even gave it the 30 days that I read an employer has to send the final pay with no luck. 

I was a salaried employee at 42.7 a year and I can’t imagine that 4 hours will be much of a check, but I’m not working and any amount of money is honestly helpful right now. Not sure what to do or id be petty for reaching out about it.
