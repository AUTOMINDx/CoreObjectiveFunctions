Does the expansion of the universe affect the time dimension as well as the spatial dimensions?
The expansion of the early universe is always described (that I've seen anyway) as an expansion of the spatial dimensions only.  Why is this?  Are we saying that the time dimension didn't change?  Or if the time dimension did change, then wouldn't that change our estimate of the age of the universe?  Or the speed of light during expansion?  Or other physical constants? etc.

Obviously I'm an outsider in this field so please go easy in your comments.  Thanks.
