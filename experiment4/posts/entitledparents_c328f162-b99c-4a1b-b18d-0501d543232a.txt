Entitled Parents seem to use my social media as a public ego masturbation zone
Backstory: I have struggled with eating disorders for a long as I can remember. It started when I was 10 and told my parents I thought I was fat (I wasn't). They agreed and happily put me on the Atkins Diet.

For 8 years they tracked my food, I had to write everything I ate down in a notebook in the living room that they would peruse at their discretion. 

Because of that, I suffered from serious malnutrition that led to epilepsy and thyroid problems. It's been extremely traumatic obviously and a lot of work for me to get better, of course now I have binging issues so my weight is higher than ever. 

Cut to yesterday: I make a post on Facebook talking about how men should know how to cook because the only men I've been able to tolerate could feed me (this is a joke, would like to think that's obvious but just in case)

My mother posted immediately "you were fed by a man growing up. Great job -OP'S dad-!" And tagged my father. 

My father, who pointed to my ass and said it was getting fatter.
Who told me he could hear me grunting because of my fat body (when I was underweight).
Who laughed at me pulling my pants up "over my gut" when I sat down. 

And my mother... who forced me to strip naked in front of her every morning and get on the scale. 

I was terribly triggered by her comment and ended up deleting the whole post. It was so upsetting. 

I know I should cut them off. Their abuse is limitless. But it's so hard to. And the worst part is they think they are so fucking great and I'm just their awful daughter who doesn't love them like I should. 

Not sure why I'm posting this other than just to vent.
