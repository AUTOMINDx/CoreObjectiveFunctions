Is it possible to make mosquitos extinct?
We humans are good at making many species extinct from the face of earth. While it's sad. There is one species that I would not miss if it was exterminated. **Mosquitos**. Apparently it's a genocidal killer species.

It might seem impossible that something so miniscule can kill so many people, but it's true. According to the **World Health Organization**, mosquito bites result in the deaths of more than **1 million people every year**. The majority of these deaths are due to malaria. The World Health Organization estimates that between **300 and 500 million cases of malaria** occur each year -- and **a child dies from malaria every 30 seconds**.  

Is it possible to create a super virus that will only effect mosquitos. Or some other ideas to get rid of it at least in densely packed cities. And no ultrasound mosquito repellers don't work. They are myth.
