Anyone else have meaningless conversations in their own head? Do you talk to yourself too much? Why does this happen
Its usually stronger when i wake up, but my mind goes on rambling random things, words, scenarios, music, everything and nothing. Of course i try to think about my day ahead through all of this, I'm able to, but I still hear the ramblings in the background of my head. As the day goes on it gets lighter and lighter. Then i start talking to myself and one thought gets me to another thought to an endless train of thoughts and conversations and scenarios.

I can "barely" get my work done and I mean the exactly barely. I feel like I could function better without this nonsense, you know? 

It is annoying for sure, but not medically annoying enough for me to do something about it. I'm just wondering if you guys go through this too and what you do to make yourself be in the present better. Also why it happens, I'm too curious now
