I miss my old life so much.
I used to be able to leave the house at morning and not come back until nighttime. Staying out all day, going to stores, living an actual life. I miss that so much.

I only developed this phobia in this last year. It evolved out of my emetophobia, which is the phobia of vomit. I would be afraid of going out in case I or someone else around me got sick and threw up in a car or train where there was no escape.

Then that developed into something else, as my anxiety gave me IBS. Now, I’m afraid to go out in case I have an IBS attack and can’t find a toilet. On top of that because of emetophobia and general health anxiety, I can’t use public bathrooms easily and they freak me out. So, I stay home because that’s the only bathroom that is both clean and immediately accessible. And every time I go out, my stomach starts killing me from anxiety. For a while I thought I had motion sickness even though I’ve never had that in my life.

I go out maybe three times a month at most at it never gets easier. It feels like I’m dying every time I have to leave my house, and no matter how many times I go through it i never get used to it. I can’t even go out and hang out with my friends so I always feel like a loser. 

I’m being forced to go to my aunts house on Christmas Day and I’m already shaking with anxiety about it. I won’t even be there long maybe two hours but being far away from home with no escape is just freaking me out. 

I seriously just want to die, I know my parents and whoever else around me will yell at me for this because they think I can just snap my fingers and not be scared. If I could change the way I am I would without a doubt. I would literally trade one of my legs or something to get rid of this fear. But I can’t.
