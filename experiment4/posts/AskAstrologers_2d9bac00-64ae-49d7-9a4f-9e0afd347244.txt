Why do I have this inner feeling of wanting to "transform" people, wanting to help them grow in a mentor-like way?
I've always felt like I learn something so much quicker if I'm also teaching it in the process of learning. Like.. I only have motivation to learn if I know that later I can teach it. Also why do I have this inner feeling that I want to help people grow in areas of life I had or still have a hard time with? I also feel like in 80% of my life situations I just want to serve people, and give. And then give even more. And it's not that I expect anything in return it just makes me feel good, gives me joy. Is there anything in my chart that would explain these? Are all of these just the cancer traits in me?
