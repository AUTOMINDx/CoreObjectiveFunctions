How do we know that the universe is expanding?
It is based on fact that we see distant galaxies as red shifted. But what if that is simply caused by light loosing its energy overtime (which would result in lower frequencies)? Or maybe itâ€™s not overtime, there could be some reason for light to lose energy in these long distances? And not by universe expansion? Considering it is traveling across universe for billions of years, we probably have no way to experiment such extreme conditions on earth? ðŸ¤” Or do we?
Do we have also some other proof of universe expansion?
