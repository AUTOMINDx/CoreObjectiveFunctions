I’m starting to smell freedom..
After being housebound for 3 years, I’ve been feeling like life is passing me by and I’m losing so much time. I want to get back out into the world. I want my life back. 

So, for the last 3 days I’ve gone out. Tuesday - city center to see Christmas lights
Wednesday - city center (another part) to see another tree
Thursday - shopping IN the grocery store

I feel amazing. I hope that I can keep pushing forward because the smell of freedom is ohhh so sweet.
