What are the ‘essential’ books for a socio-cultural anthropologist?
Though this may be a broad category, Im curious as to if there are classic and fundamental books that every anthropologist should consider reading. Obviously there isnt a set list or checklist of books you absolutely have to read to be a socio cultural anthropologist, but I would love some recommendations. Whos your favourite author? What book taught you a lot? What book changed your life haha.
