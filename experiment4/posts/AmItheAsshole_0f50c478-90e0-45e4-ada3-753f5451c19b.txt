AITA for snitching on my stepdad to his ex wife which basically ruined Christmas for him and my mom
Ok guys I’ve not got time to check my grammar because  I’m  using an old phone with 26% battery due to fact my own phone got taken away as punishment 


Important backstory- my (16f) stepbrother(16m) of two years is a little person (term he personally said was ok to use) who nearly everyone at my school likes because he is an extremely funny person, everyone expect for a girl I will call Maryann she goes out of her to make his life hell  due to him being a little person 


He’s usually good at making her insults into jokes  but she really up her game lately to the point even her own friends told her it wasn’t funny. Yesterday she made a comment about his sister who passed away and used ableist slurs about them both 

Than told him to you know himself and save my stepdad the embarrassment of having a (slur) as a son 

He snapped and called her multiple names like the school bike/slut than said the only reason she hates him so much is because even he as (m slur) looks down at her 

There was other stuff said between them both but I don’t wanna get the post flagged 

Maryann ended up walking way crying due to the fact everyone was laughing at her because again my stepbrother is extremely funny. Her mom ended up at my moms house screaming about everything 

They wouldn’t let my stepbrother explain, even when I and my brothers (15m&amp;18m) tried to stuck up for him  they basically told us shut up and painted Maryann this innocent victim, 

His dad who is a massive pick me and flirt to anything in a skirt imo said some really disgusting stuff to his son and made him apologise 

Maryann gave him a “fuck You smirk” on her way out. My stepdad scream out my stepbrother extremely ablest stuff than broke his phone and told him he doesn’t want to see him till next Sunday when his mom was due to pick him up 


He (stepdad) rang his ex and told her a completely different story even lied that we (me and my siblings) said he was harassing Maryann because she rejected him 


So here’s were I might be the asshole I looked up his ex on Facebook and told her the truth and how my stepbrother was suffering at the hands of Maryann but was too ashamed to tell anyone because of his dad because he knew what would happen 

Well long story short his mom ended up at our house with her cop brother and my stepbrother took his stuff 

She said she is suing him for damages to her sons stuff and that he will never see my stepbrother again. She showed them my messages when they asked her how she found out 

I got grounded and my phone/iPad taken away. My mom came into my room crying saying I ruined Christmas because we will have to use all our money for lawyers to get out of the mess I created and it wasn’t any of my business what happened


Edit so I’m currently at my granny’s house till my dad gets back from work (my brothers are here too) and I’ve texted my stepbrother since I’ve gotten my phone back, his mom gave Maryann and her mom hell literally left them in tears. My dad said he will try and get full custody, also I’ve blocked my mom I didn’t want to hear her guilt tripping bs and I’ve taken anything important with me so it won’t go “missing” till I can get all my stuff out. Thank you everyone for your advice
