What would happen if every company in the US refused to pay more than minimum wage?
I was just curious about a hypothetical, I hope that's ok for this sub.

What would happen if every company in America just decided one day that they wouldn't pay any worker more than minimum wage?

Are there any sort of market mechanics that would prevent this from happening? And in the event that it did happen, would any market mechanics disrupt those circumstances?

Is there anything stopping companies from coordinating wages (besides laws) so that quitting your job for a better company isn't an option?
