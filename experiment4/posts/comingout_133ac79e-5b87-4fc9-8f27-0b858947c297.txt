I need advice as I was probably outed at school.
Formerly close friend: I'll call Jane(not real name trying to protect mine and her anonymity)


Person who I was outed to: I'll call Matthew (again fake name)


So basically a while ago I realized I was trans (MTF). Eventually I decided to tell two people Jane and another close friend. Jane was prettty understanding and agreed to keep it secret. However we've drifted apart overtime and shes drifted closer to Matthew. Now Matthew has a habit of being a big bully(keep in mind I'm in middle school) and he specifically has bullied me. So going to this day I heard Jane mention he's MTF to Matthew and it was right after Matthew made a comment intended as an insult calling me a girly girl. Then later Jane made several other references to me and my gender without actively saying anything. Then later in the day when I was getting an onslaught of comments when Matthew specifically said something me being gay(Idk if I am or not but that's not the point) and then change it to transgender. Which makes me suspicious that I was outed or Matthew put the pieces together. I wouldn't expect her to do this because she's openly lesbian so this is a bit odd. Any advice?
