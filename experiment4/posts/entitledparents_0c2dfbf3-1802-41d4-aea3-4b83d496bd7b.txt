Karen Takes my ESA dog!?
So I have a dog.(let's call her Roxy. Shes a ESA dog btw) I was taking her on a walk and then a wild Karen arrives.

Karen: OMG CAN I PET UR DOG?

Me: No you can't. Shes my ESA dog and whenever we're in pet friendly places she's working

Karen: esa dogs don't have the same rights as service dogs ,so she can't be working. Just let me pet her real quick. Geez!

Me:NO! NOW GET AWAY FROM ME!

Karen literally Pushes me to get to my ESA and grabbed Roxy by the collar. I slapped her hand and took Roxy. She then decides to LURE MY DOG INTO THE ROAD WHERE A CAR WAS COMING. Then Roxy thinks this must be a new friend and goes. I grabbed Roxy and we ran. Some bystander called the cops and she was arrested. Thank God for her. This happened a few minutes ago and I couldn't sleep and needed to get this of my chest. Thank God for reddit



EDIT: I have a bunch More Stories to tell you about this Karen but I'll post later

EDIT 2: YALL I UNDERSTAND THAT SHES A ESA DOG AND SHE DOSENT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS BUT SOCIETY DOSENT REALIZED THAT ESA ARE WORKING DOGS PLUS I TRAINED MY DOG CAN YALL JUST STOP WITH THAT PLS STOP HATING ON ME AND ROXY
