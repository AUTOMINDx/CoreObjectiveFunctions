Interview Tip #1
“What are your current salary requirements?” 

Don’t answer this question with a number. Don’t. Under any circumstances. Don’t do it. It’s a very common question for HR or the hiring interviewer to ask during an interview. It’s also all things considered a reasonable question to ask from their side, but don’t give them a number. Here’s how you respond. “I’m certainly flexible if the job is a good fit which I think it will be. What is the range you have budgeted for this position?” 9/10 times they will respond telling you what you’ll end up making.

Say a job is going to pay in the range of $17-$23 an hour. If you answer with $16 you’ve sold yourself short. If you say $30 you’re going to come across as a crazy person. Now you know to talk about your skills and what you bring to the company and shoot for that upper range. 

Information is power. Get them to give you the information you need and go from there. If they ask online to fill out a section that asks how much you want don’t fill it out. If it makes you fill it out just put $1.

Edit: Everyone is saying this is bad advice because you need to do research beforehand and have a good range in mind. Obviously, do that as well. Don’t go in completely blind. But at the end of the day this is the best way not to sell yourself short.
