Does the universe ending in a heat death or “big freeze” scenario rule out another universe being created?
Does the universe ending in a heat death or “big freeze” scenario rule out another universe being created?

In the Wikipedia article for the heat death of the universe it says “It is also possible that entropy production will cease and the universe will reach heat death. *Another universe could possibly be created by random quantum fluctuations or quantum tunnelling* in roughly [a large number of] years”. It references [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0410270).

Is this generally agreed upon by experts? 

Though I have no proper idea of what they are (or even if they *are*), I take it that “quantum fluctuations” will continue eternally?

So a heat death doesn’t rule out a new universe? 

Thank you and sorry if the question is stupid!
