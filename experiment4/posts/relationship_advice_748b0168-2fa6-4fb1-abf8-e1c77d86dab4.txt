My [16F] father [39M] is dating his counselor [40F] and I dont think it's right.
We lost my mom to covid around Christmas of last year. My dad then signed up for therapy for me and him. Over time, this became a sexual relationship for the two and it got to the point where he brings her home and sleeps with her. 

Now my problem isnt that my mom is being replaced (I understand the need for human companionship) but that the counselor patient relationship is extremely inappropriate. When I try to tell him to at least have her leave her job if they want to date, he refuses and threatens to take away my college fund if I reveal any of this.

What do I do?
