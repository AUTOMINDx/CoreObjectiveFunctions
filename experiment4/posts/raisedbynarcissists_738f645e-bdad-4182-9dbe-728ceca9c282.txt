My therapist had an interesting theory yesterday about my "autism"
I apologize for the long post, but there is a LOT to unpack from yesterday's session with my therapist:

I was supposedly diagnosed with autism at age 6. I remember going to the autism society in town and being diagnosed. My mom told me stories where i had meltdowns over people wearing socks, having no eye contact, and crying a lot, and they diagnosed me based on that. My mom claims that I got treatment and then I was cured. 

My therapist thinks however my NM was using my autism to get attention, aka Munchausen by Proxy. My therapist thinks I don't really have any autistic traits as an adult and theorizes that the emotional and verbal abuse I suffered and NM bullying me for my emotions is what was really wrong with me. When she said that, my jaw hit the floor. My therapist is awesome but I dunno if she's right or not since I remember having to work with special needs teachers until 6th grade. However if my mom was indeed milking it and faking it or I was misdiagnosed, I'm going to lose it. I was bullied over being autistic. I had no friends. I'm choking up right now. My mom likes to think she's some hero just because she got me help. But then she gets pissy when I ask her not to tell everyone that I have autism so they don't make fun of me. Ugh.

What are your thoughts and have you dealt with this? Thanks.
