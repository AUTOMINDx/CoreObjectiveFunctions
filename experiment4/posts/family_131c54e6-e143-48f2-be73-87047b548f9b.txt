Unvaccinated Christmas
This is my first post here ever and I need some unbiased advice. I’m struggling with this and I always try to follow my instincts. We’re going to visit family for Christmas- my in laws. I also think my husband’s sister and her family will be there. They are all anti vaxxers. Everyone of them (3 including the kids). They aren’t taking the pandemic seriously, they don’t wear proper face coverings when they go out, they think that it’s not as serious as the government makes it to be, they also think that it’s all a scam/big pharma scheme. I don’t want to go there for supper and seeing them in their home. I don’t feel comfortable but feel a lot of pressure from my husband. Our children want to see everyone but I don’t think they get the gravity of the situation. Then again I feel if I get COVID or a variant, I’ll resent my husband. I don’t know what to do. Am I being too paranoid? I’m considering sending him alone and then making him isolate. Please help… also I hate this pandemic.
