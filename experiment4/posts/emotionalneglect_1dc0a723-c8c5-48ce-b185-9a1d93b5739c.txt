Anyone else without any social life?
I've been in therapy for over a year which is teaching me about the emotional neglect I endured throughout my childhood. 

I haven't had a friend or partner in over five years. I've spent most of my time being in denial of this painful reality, but I'm starting to let the pain out. 

I'm realizing I've never had a close friendship. I've had numerous friends throughout my childhood, but never the type of best friend in movies or tv shows where you share secrets with each other and know everything about the other. Just kind of friends to pass the time with at school. I usually changed friends every couple of years. I never actually learned/understood the value of friendships or how to make friends. So since finishing school and entering the workforce, those natural situations to make friends are gone.

I've only ever been close with ex boyfriends. But I was a terrible girlfriend. Needy, insecure, jealous. I always wanted all of them and anything less was never enough. Basically I wanted them to fill the void of parental love which is impossible. 

Im grieving the fact that the type of love I long for is not possible to receive from anyone other than a parent, and that just wasn't in the cards for me. 

Now I'm left as a 30 year old who doesn't understand relationships. What they're supposed to be like, feel like. Intimacy and vulnerability was not modeled in my home. 

I can't help but think it's a little too late to cultivate the type of friendships I crave. People are marrying off, starting families, focusing on their careers, and already have strong support systems. And here I am trying to learn what friendship is like a 5 year old.

I feel like all there is to do is just grieve for what I missed out on. And maybe try to remain hopeful for my future, though I'm not too good at that.

I apologize for rambling on. Maybe you related to something I wrote. Anyone else suffering through this alone?
