Any advice for me? Should I break up with him? What would you do?………………..
Instead of making a long story, I listed bullet points to detail the current relationship with my 39 year old boyfriend. These are the things that are a bit much for me.

• He’s a caregiver for his mother. (I don’t want him to stop being a caregiver but he uses her as an excuse for literally everything.)

• He has limited income from his side business, struggling with finances, but yet won’t seek a more stable job.

• He has no savings and behind on all bills.

• He’s borrowing money from different people and obtaining payday loans to stay afloat digging himself deeper in debt.

• I found out that he’s never had his own place before moving last year in October. Prior to moving into his own place he stayed in his dad’s basement for 10 years. He claims his business was successful then but I highly question that. If his business was so successful and he stayed with his dad, how could he not have a decent amount of money saved.

I love him but I feel like he’s holding me back. I’m only 27! I also don’t want him to think I’m being selfish.
