I hate that I don’t have the guts to kill myself
I’m such a fucking coward and a waste of space. My life is going ok right now but I still want to die. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life waiting for happiness that isn’t going to come. My plan is to get some coke from my old dealer and OD. It’s easier than a gun or hanging in my mind cause it’s harder to back out once you’ve taken the drugs but I know I’ll just fuck up or my family will find me and try to help me but I’m tired of being helped. I’m so tired and just want things to end. Everything feels so useless and I don’t want to burden myself and my loved ones anymore.
