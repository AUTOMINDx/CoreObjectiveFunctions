Was Paris cheap in the 1920s or artists well off?
Hello,

been reading a memoir of Hemingway about his life in Paris as a young writer. A repeating motif is that of dining out, drinking lots of wine and rum, always staying in a caf√©/restaurant, spending money on trips and lots of "pension" apartments. Hemingway himself recalls in the book that they didn't have much money back then. Was life really that cheap back then, or did these writers/artists really make enough money to live so comfortably-?
