I did a task for a job interview, but haven't heard back?
Hi,

So I could use some advice on what to do in this situation. I applied for a freelance writing position for a magazine and had my initial interview where the interviewer said for the next steps I was to write 3 articles that would work for their magazine and these would be paid for! This task was quite time-consuming as you can imagine, so I sent them off to her and heard nothing back for a few days so I chased her up the first time. The interviewer said they were waiting for sign-off from higher up before they make their decision.

Now, this was at least 3 weeks ago... so I appreciate I haven't got the role, but as she said these were paid and took up a decent amount of time, I'm getting pretty irritated. Should I chase her up again?
