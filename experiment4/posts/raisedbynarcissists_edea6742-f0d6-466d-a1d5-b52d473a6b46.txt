I landed a paid internship at one of the giant food companies today and I want anyone to be proud of me.
I studied food technology. I went NC with my nFamily back in June and started focusing on myself more.

Sent many, many applications for an internship from October and today the HR from one of the biggest international food companies came back to me saying that the hiring manager would like to hire me with a high possibility of a full time position after I'll be done with my masters. 

I feel like exploding from happiness. I wasn't even sure if I gave all the correct answers during the interview yesterday. 

I have never achieved something this big in my life and I know that my nFamily would just diminish it by saying something along the lines of 'oh it's just an internship' when it actually matters to me.

I want to share my happiness with you all and I wish anyone would be proud of my small achievement.

ETA: I need to say it's hard not to (try to) work for Nestl√© because they've openings every year with lots of benefits too but under no circumstances am I going to work for them!
