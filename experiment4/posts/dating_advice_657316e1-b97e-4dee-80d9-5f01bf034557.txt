Do men like if a girl compliments them on their looks? Or is that corny?
I feel this is something mostly men do to women but recently I liked a guys look a lot and I haven’t said anything to him but I feel an urge to tell him that I love his hair and his “features”.

I don’t wanna come
Off as “easy” or “thirsty”

I also don’t wanna seem “lame” or “corny”

I dunno, this is likely a stupid question as I’m sure guys like compliments obviously but just wanting to know how men feel about them in general
