Update on being ghosted by my T after 7 years
So I wrote here in the past, around like 2-3 months ago, that I was very depressed, and then angry, after my T ghosted me by message (and after having me as a patient for 7 years), first ignoring my messages and calls to schedule a session (I was having a really bad time dealing with anxiety), then after some tries, said she couldn’t help me anymore, just like that. This has impacted me a lot for the next weeks. I wasn’t expecting this at all and I shared this with my psychiatrist. He said she was completely unreasonable and I was right to be mad. She didn’t even refer me to anyone and, when I asked if I could at least see her for a closure, she replied “it wasn’t needed”.
She is the only one who knows everything about me and my past, and I still get itches when thinking about that.

BUT, good news is, I am so glad she did this, otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten a new therapist who is much better at her job, much more competent and organised than my ex T, doesn’t make me wait 10 min for the session to start, she is really nice and she is helping me a lot. I am seeing a lot of improvements I didn’t see when I was seeing the other. I connect with her with a lot more ease. There are still very good professionals out there.

If you happen to get ghosted by your T, it’s not the end of the world. You shouldn’t be working with someone who doesn’t care much even tho she looked like she did ONLY during sessions. It can actually help you even more. Relationship with T is a major factor for successful results.

Tysm for those who replied to my past posts about this matter and for those who are supporting me! I am much better now.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the supportive messages! I really appreciate those who read me and wish all the best for you and your paths.
