Why are the gifts from the”Twelve Days of Christmas” mostly birds and servants?
I’ve just noticed the carol has pretty much birds and servants through the whole carol. Why is this? 

The lyrics are below

On the 12th day of Christmas
My true love sent to me
12 drummers drumming
Eleven pipers piping
Ten lords a-leaping
Nine ladies dancing
Eight maids a-milking
Seven swans a-swimming
Six geese a-laying
Five golden rings (five golden rings)
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle-doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
