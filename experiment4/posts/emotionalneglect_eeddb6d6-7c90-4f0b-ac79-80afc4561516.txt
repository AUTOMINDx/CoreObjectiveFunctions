Tired of pretending to be normal / fitting in and protecting others from my pain.
I met an old friend yesterday (hadn’t seen in 2 years – he lives overseas), and he is very normal (loving family etc).  I have been finding our calls (once a quarter) harder and harder, as I focus on healing my traumas. 

He knows little about my trauma, he knows I have “stuff”, but he is clearly not wanting to go there. We became friends at a time when I was faking it well / had blocked my pain. 

We had this dull long chat, and its because I also cant get excited for his day to day stuff. 

“Oh that’s interesting….you are spending time with your parents over Christmas”

I would like to rather reply with

“Well, I cant, as my mother abandoned me, and my father is an addict who neglected and abused me”

But I deflect, and nod. 

Big part of me doesn’t want to be alone as i have lost many a friend in this journey and my shutdown periods, but a big part also, as I heal, just cant be bothered with pretending anymore. This fakery is crushing my desire for my authentic needs now, which I have ignored and had blocked for so long. 

This has turned into a rant, but I don’t know where else to put it. 

Thank you for reading
