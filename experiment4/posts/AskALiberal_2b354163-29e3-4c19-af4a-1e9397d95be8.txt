What do you think about the Applebee's / cheesecake factory arrests in New York over Vaccine protest?
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/applebees-protest-new-york-four-arrested

New York has mandated that in order to enter a restaurant or gym, you must provide proof of at least one vaccine. Several protests happened over the last two days at a Queens mall in New york. These were peaceful "sit in" protests. Seven were arrested at the cheesecake factory, and the next day four were arrested at the Applebee's for trespassing. 

It is pretty evident that the intention of the protesters was to get arrested to draw attention to their cause.

Businesses are required to have a written plan on how they will enforce the vaccine mandates. 12-year-olds are exempt, people who are entering briefly (such as to use the restroom or take out) are not required to show proof. It appears that people who cannot get vaccinated because of medical restrictions will not be allowed to eat in restaurants, use gyms, or access other forms of entertainment unless they have proof of a recent negative covid test.

Do you think the vaccine mandate is reasonable? Do you think that this is a reasonable use of police?
