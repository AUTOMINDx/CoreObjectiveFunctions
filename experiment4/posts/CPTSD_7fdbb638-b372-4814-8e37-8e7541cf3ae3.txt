DAE feel like they're "trauma dumping" just by talking about periods of their life?
I feel a lot of anxiety about getting to know new people because I feel like common subjects in the stages of connecting are off-limits. I mean, I feel like it's suspicious to avoid innocent questions but I struggle to find short answers that don't just invite further questions or make the other person feel bad for asking. Every response feels like it's a dramatic overshare or creates drama through omission.

Questions like "what does your dad do for work?" just don't have any good answer:

* "I don't really know, honestly" makes *me* sound kind of bad
* "I don't actually talk to my dad" or "I haven't seen him in several years" makes things awkward or invites further questions
* Suggesting a different topic or explaining it's a long story seems avoidant
* Lying is, well, lying
* Anything to the effect of "my dad left when I was a kid" is... a lot, even if it isn't the whole story

I don't mind talking about early trauma and such, but I'm aware that it makes many people uncomfortable. How do you guys deal with "getting to know you" questions that only have "I don't know if you're ready for this" type answers?
