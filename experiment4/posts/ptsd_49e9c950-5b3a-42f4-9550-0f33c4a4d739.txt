How does everyone cope with the Holidays?
It’s been so hard for me lately. I cannot go out to see my family on Christmas or Thanksgiving. Christmas is coming up soon, and I refuse to leave the house that day. Everything is a trigger. I live with my boyfriend, and he has his own family obviously. So he’s going to go, I’m going to stay back alone at our apartment. I don’t really have family, I only have two people in my family. I can’t even bring myself to see those two for at least a couple minutes. So I’ll be home alone, like on thanksgiving. I’m better off staying at home alone, but still. The thought is so depressing. I think I’ll just be drunk all day.
