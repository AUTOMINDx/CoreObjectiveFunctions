Housebound for 5+ years help
Hey. Iâ€™m a 20 year old girl, who has severe agoraphobia, emetophobia and health anxiety. Iâ€™ve been stuck in my house for over 5 years... It all started 2016, when i started to get nauseous every time i ate. This of course triggered my emetophobia really bad, and i immeadiately started to avoid doing anything. Obviously i thought it would get better, but i still have it. I donâ€™t know what causes it. But it makes it impossible to leave my house. I know i should go to therapy, but i canâ€™t. I should also see a doctor, but i canâ€™t. Iâ€™m stuck, and i hate it. But at the same time itâ€™s comfortable and safe.
I had to drop out of school, i have no education, job, or friends... i hate how iâ€™m making my family feel. I donâ€™t know if theres anyone that can relate or am i just crazy. I also need meds but i would have to go to the doctor for that. I just feel like i canâ€™t do anything to help myself... just wanna know if anyone can relate even little or offer some tipsðŸ˜…
