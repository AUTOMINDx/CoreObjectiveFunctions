Is It Okay To Give Up On Trying To Make Friends?
Hello everyone. I'm 23 years old by today and at the moment I have no group, no close friends, no meetups and I feel like I exhausted my options. I tried to teach myself social skills, tried searching for friends, opening up even though I'm introvert ( going to parks, gatherings, discords, chatting sites; trying to talk with random strangers and try to hold a decent conversation). I also tried to do some of the advices of experts.

I try to be sweet as possible. Try to never upset people. Try to make them feel good from conversations. Giving them presents. Remembering interesting facts about them

Today on my birthday I kind of gave up on the whole making friends idea.

**TL-DR: Not one option worked about trying to have friends and I gave up.**

Last Note: I have been alone from birth and I don't feel I belong to any group or people. Also I got cheated on twice by both of my girlfriends one after another (I had only 2 relationship) and never been able to trust people and let my guard down.
