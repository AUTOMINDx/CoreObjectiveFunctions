How to tell my boss I don’t want to train the new employees in a position I applied for?
We recently hired two new employees to fill the positions above mine and I don’t think I should have to train them. 

I’ve been at my company for three years, and have been in my current position for 4 months. Shortly after I started, we had the two positions above mine open up. My managers always gave me positive feedback, and I let them know I was interested in the open position. My boss told me that although I would do great and she would hire me if she could, our (unwritten) company rule is that you have to be in your position for 1 year before being promoted. They then went with two other external candidates. 

Although the new hires seem great, they don’t know our systems or processes. Since my company has a poor onboarding process, the responsibility is left to the team to board the new members. My boss never had a conversation with my about training them, and has been sending me emails asking me to take action on different things and train the new employees on how to do it. 

In my opinion, my boss had a team member who was interested in the position and already trained (me), and I shouldn’t have to train individuals in positions above mine while I am getting paid far less than them. 

I feel I need to talk to my boss about this, but how would I word it in the most respectful way while still standing my ground? Or should I just suck it up and train them?
