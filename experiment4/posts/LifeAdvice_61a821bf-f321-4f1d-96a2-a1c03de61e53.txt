I reached my goal weight
I am posting after a long time, few days ago I entered my weight in my app and it congratulated me for reaching the target. It took me 7 months to reach 64kg (141 lbs) from 71 kg(156.5 lbs). I would like to ask the community how do I maintain this weight. I am 174 cm tall female. I am happy with the weight loss but I still have small belly fat, can anyone please tell me how do I lose this fat? 


I didn't do anything rigorous for weight loss, just controlled eating , dropped midnight snacking and brisk walking 5k steps every day.
