How small can we pack the universe
Enough of  being intimadated by the the size of the bugger. If we convert all the universe in gold (my fav metal), and make a ball, it would fit in the space between Sun and Proxima Centauri, our nearest neighbor, with plenty room to spare for my couch and TV. Heck, while we are on our murderous spree, we might as well compress it to the level of a neutron star. Then it would be a ball just 6 AU wide - not even reaching Jupiter.

Are there any other denser states of matter in nature (not counting a black hole)? 

Here I am considering only the mass of the known universe 1.5x 10\^53. What else am I missing?
