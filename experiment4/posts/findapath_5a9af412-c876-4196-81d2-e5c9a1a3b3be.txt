24 year old with no work history.
Is it possible to get a job at this stage? Bc of legal reasons I could not work in the country Iâ€™m in right now but I am about to get a work permit really soon and I have no work experience, no college degree and nothing else going for me. I want to have a remote job if possible and I was thinking of being an online assistant but idk how to go about it without experience. I want to gain financial independence and be able to travel next year. Help.
