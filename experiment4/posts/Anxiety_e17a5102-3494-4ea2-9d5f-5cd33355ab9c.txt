Iâ€™m currently opening my store as a manager for the first time! Wish me luck
I work at auntie Anneâ€™s and Iâ€™m so nervous: the morning anxiety and hot flashes are killing me but cold water helps ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Update: THANKS EVERYONE! The first two hours were a little stressful especially with my physical symptoms. I felt so hot and out of itðŸ¤£. But again, the cold water helps and everything was good after. I appreciate you all so much honestly.m!
