I have to take a class taught by professor who rejected me for a postdoc next year - make me feel better?
I'm a late-stage STEM PhD student. In the spring I have a class I need to take. (It's not strictly required but the topic sets me up extremely well for where I want my research to go next.) Unfortunately, the professor is someone I wanted to do a postdoc with because his research area is basically the perfect fit for what I want to do next, for the same reason. Recently, he (very politely) rejected me after a very awkward interview. I am generally awkward, but this was on another level. I just found out he's the professor for the class, which makes sense in hindsight. I'm still feeling pretty sore about the interview - it was my first postdoc interview, too - and I just don't know how to handle this well. 

To make it harder, the professor is brilliant, inspiring, and enormously intimidating. I'm scared about my ability to survive the class, but I realize the topic is still the perfect fit for what I want, so I'm balancing my resilience with my career goals and I want my career to win. I'm not worried about grades or anything, and he has a reputation for being kind and fair. 

I'm afraid of extreme awkwardness on my part, (and I'm afraid of that affecting him at all, since he's kind), plus I'm afraid of being hurt every lecture when he says cool things and I feel the sense of missing out on working with someone like that on a topic I've come to love. It will be a fairly small class (about 12 people?). Even though I won't work with him (sob), it would also help my career if I can be pleasant enough through the class that he could help me find a related job, since he's a big figure in the area, and I would like to get into a mindset where I can just absorb the class content and his wisdom without feeling bad. 

Please help? I just feel stuck in my head and I'm so scared.
