Is it possible for a layman to read a published scientific study critically?
I came ~~upon~~ across this study. The results seem dubious and it's is sponsored by a cosmetic company and performed by employees of that same company.  I smell 100%, grade A bullshit. 

Of course, I do not have the scientific knowledge to review this study. But is there any other way to determine if this is bullshit or not?
