Esophageal cancer?
Hey guys, I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow and I’m going to try to get an endoscopy. I’m 26, I’ve had acid reflux on and off (or so I thought) since I was like 18. I thought it went away but a few weeks ago my throat started hurting/burning and it last a few days. I also had hoarseness in my voice. I realized reflux caused it because when I laid down the acid came up to my throat and it burned badly. Since then I’ve felt chest tightness, excessive burping which turned into difficulty to burp, trapped gas, back pain, side pain, and slight stomach pain. When I drink water it makes a weird clicking noise going down.
I’m freaking out and crying..
