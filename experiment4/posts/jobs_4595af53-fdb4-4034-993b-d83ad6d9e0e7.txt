Rejection even with referral
I'm down today. I'm tired of getting rejected. I'm a Master's student with excellent grades, been at my job almost 10 years, and have great experience.  I had the career center at my college look at my LinkedIn, resume examples, and cover letter examples and they say it all looks great and my experience is impressive. Applied for job that I was fully qualified for AND had a referral. Also had connected with the recruiter who said he was excited to see my resume in the pool. Got the reject email and not even an interview. I'm so confused and disheartened. I have $150k in school loans and make the level of money of an Associates degree. I'm scared.
