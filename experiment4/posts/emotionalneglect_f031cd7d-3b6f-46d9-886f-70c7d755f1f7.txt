I love learning about myself
I feel like I'm a little late in life because I'm just learning things about myself now that I'm in my twenties. I feel so proud to successfully identify my own tastes or personality traits sometimes, it may sound silly but it feels like I can finally take ownership of my own person. I just love being able to understand myself, no one else ever really tried and maybe that's why it feels releasing. Also, I rarely feel lonely anymore because I know I have myself as an ally ahah.
