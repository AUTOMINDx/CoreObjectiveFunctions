I’m becoming the person 12-year-old me needed.
EDIT: wow this blew up! Thanks everyone. I hope we can all get to a place of inner peace someday. 

Feels good man. 

As usual with victims of childhood trauma, I grew up too fast to survive. I didn’t get to enjoy life. I had no one to support me; I was always supporting others even from my early teen years. 

I just realized today I’m the person I’d look up to as unsure, confused, scared 12 year old me. I am confident, secure, comfortable in my skin, funny, interesting…. Even if I didn’t always see it. I have grown so much and it’s both refreshing and embarrassing to look back on the past baggage that held me down. 

If I could go back on that particularly traumatic night 14 years ago, I’d hug her and tell her she’s going to get through this and rise out of the ashes. 

Thanks for reading.
