anyone hate the conflict that arises from wanting to support others but also feeling deeply pained from seeing them succeed beyond you?
it happens all the time, especially for me as an artist. i just love art and love seeing good art but whenever i see it i get this sense of being worthless in comparison, like all my accomplishments have been invalidated by it. as a result i find reasons to hate on it or just ignore it for the sake of my mental health. but people wouldn't get it and keep on praising and promoting in front of me. it's not their fault, but it still hurts, right?
