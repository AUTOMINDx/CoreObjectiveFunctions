Hey. Advice on coming out?
So here’s the thing. I was born a female and now I’m pretty sure i’m non binary. I already came out to my mom as bisexual(that was stupid because i’ve never liked a guy romantically) but when I talked about not wanting breasts, she said she’d “draw the line” if i decided to chop my breasts off and become a man. I know i’m non binary but her transphobia is really showing so i’m scared anyway. The reasonable thing for me to do would be to wait until i’m older(i’m a minor) and then come out so that way i’d be stable if she decided to never talk to me again. But everyone around me is addressing me as a “young lady” or other related terms and it makes me upset. I really don’t know what to do.
