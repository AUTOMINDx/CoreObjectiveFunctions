I'm 30, burnt out and traumatized from my last job, and not sure what to do next. Can I get anyone's advice?
Not sure what happened to me, but I think I got traumatized from my last job. I work in the architecture field and in my last company that I got to work in, there literally was no work-life balance. Id normally sign out really late, and even work on weekends for the same amount of hours on a weekday. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind working long hours, but not like  weeks or even months straight. So I resigned.

Now I'm unemployed in the middle of  pandemic, and not sure what to do. I just don't feel like working in the same field again. But I'm too scared to take the risk on a different one. BUT I am considering learning something tech-related, but it'll take time to learn stuff. I just don't know where to go from here, please help.

Update 18/12I've decided on trying out new things. I'm looking into learning blender OR learning coding. Appreciate all the positive replies and support! Sure I can Google, but any additional tips on where to start are very much welcome! :)
