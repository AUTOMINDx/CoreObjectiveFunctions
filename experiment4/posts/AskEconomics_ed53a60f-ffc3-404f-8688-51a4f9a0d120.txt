Why is real leather so rare and expensive, if millions of cows are being killed every day for food?
I despise fake leather/pleather with all my existence. It looks ugly; it cracks, ruining favourite clothes and getting flakes everywhere - including my eye one time; and it's EVERYWHERE.

Why is it so hard to find things with real leather or suede? They just discard the skin of all the animals they murder. I'm pretty sure real leather is the more ecological option, instead of producing brand new, plastic abomination.
