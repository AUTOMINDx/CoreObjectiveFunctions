i have friends who will send me tiktoks about my chronic illnesses. i’m sick of it. what to do?
it’s not uncommon for friends to send me or show me tiktoks about disability. it’s so fucking weird to me that they feel the need to show me this piece of media on the basis that i’m also disabled. are we all the same??

usually it’s sick people joking about their circumstances and how people will act very ableist towards them. it’s the ableist character in the videos that make me feel so bad

i confronted one on how horrible they made me, and she shrugged it off saying she jokes about her tough experiences with friends all the time. idk what to do. my heart hurts and it’s xmas
