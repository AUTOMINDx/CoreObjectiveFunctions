You are capable to ENJOY your time outside the house. My recent success story.
Yesterday me and my bud planned to go out to a cafe around 6 kms away. (not that much, but i feels like 60 if you have Agoraphobia).

As we were midway I started to feel muscles behind my ear clench and sound sensitivity kicked in. Once again! I knew what was happening. I was starting to get into the fight-or-flight panicky mode.

Soon we stopped on the red light and idk but somehow i had this courage surge through me. I said to my bud out loud - "i don't care even if i pass out in the cafe or die right there and then, i won't budge. i won't go back." Suddenly afterwards my panic decreased.

We parked the car in adjacent to the cafe as we arrived there. Another task for me was to get out of the car and walk through the people traffic towards the cafe while keeping the composure. And i did keep my composure and walked inside the cafe.

We ordered a brownie and sodas and for a good 10mins i FORGOT i was Agoraphobic. I behaved normally like i would have done 9 months ago out in the public. I enjoyed every moment in the cafe, surprisingly!

The task was done BUT i had another urge to go to the mall. There was enough confidence built in the cafe itself which propelled me to do it. I said it to my friend and we were on the way. 

We went to the mall (was not the part of the plan, we had just wanted to go to the cafe) and i bought a sick turtle neck t-shirt for me as my reward for doing exceptionally good. I enjoyed there too wholeheartedly.

This was my longest exposure in 9 months outside my safe zone, my house.

If i can do it you can do it too! lol, it's not much but for me its a good start. :)

What I learned - 

1. The scenario that you create in your mind about going out and let's say puking, passing or freaking out is not nearly 1% close to the actual reality.
2. You can do much more than you think.
3. You are capable of ENJOYING like normal people the normal stuff like going out.
