Update: entitled mother leaves her children with me to watch and doesn’t pay me
Hi all, 

A few months ago I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/qkts9f/my_neighbor_knocks_on_my_door_and_demands_i_watch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) here about how my neighbor knocks on my door with her kids, demands I watch them and doesn’t pay me. 

I got a lot of feedback on my post, mostly telling me to either call CPS or grow a backbone and tell her to screw off. I’m terribly bad at confrontations and saying no to people, and she obviously had taken advantage of this. 

So I wanted to update you all on what I had decided to do about the situation. 

Call me a nark, a snitch, or whatever else, but I told my buildings management. I sent them an email saying that I was concerned because my neighbor pushes her children onto me for me to care for despite my home not being suited for children to be running around, and that she seems negligent regarding parental duties. I informed them that she didn’t pay me and that I felt I had no ability to escape the situation. 

They sent an email to the entire building that said there has been issues with forcing neighbors to watch each other’s children and stated that it is against residents leases to leave children unattended in the building and that this lease violation can result in eviction and law enforcement involvement. The email included a link to a local babysitting company and it also requested residents report incidents of leaving children with others to management. 

This occurred 5 days ago and she hasn’t knocked on my door since.
