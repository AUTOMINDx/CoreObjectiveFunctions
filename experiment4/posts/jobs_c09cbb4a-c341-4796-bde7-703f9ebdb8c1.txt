Co worker ignores me and gives me the icy cold shoulder. No idea why, only known him a couple months.
So at my place of work there is a co worker and we both do the same job here but he just ignores me completely. Zero eye contact, seems to really go out of his way to do the opposite of working together. Even saying good morning to him in the morning is a futile exercise, he ignores me. 


When he is required to talk to me, it is extremely monosyllabic and curt, one word answers only. This one time we were both required to go somewhere to be shown something, instead of us both going together, he just walked straight past me and charged off. He knew we were both required there, anyone else would have stopped and said 'right let's go then'. He really does have absolutely zero interest in working together, and the worst thing is he ignores me! I asked him once if things are OK between us, he just frowned and pretended I didn't say anything. 


I have had unpleasant co workers before but this is a pretty unique case for me. No he does not have some kind of aspergers or something because he is pretty Norma and friendly with everyone else. It's having a negative effect on me because he is actually extremely competent at his job, he only needs to be shown how to do something once and he will replicate that task without fault. He really goes out of his way to do things himself, zero communication and constantly sidelines me. It feels like he is determined to make me look as useless as possible as he is more experienced in the job and does not want to share the workload so I can both learn the job and take the workload off him. He is such a goddamn bastard and I don't know what to do. Its a completely passive type of asshole.
