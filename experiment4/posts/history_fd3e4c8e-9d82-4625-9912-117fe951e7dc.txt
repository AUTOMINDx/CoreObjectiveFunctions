The US Occupancy of the Philippines
After the Spanish-American War, control of Cuba and the Philippines was transferred from Spain to the United States in 1898. Cuba gained it's independence in 1902. The Philippines, where they fought America at one point, didn't get that until 1946 and only after a bill was passed about 10 years ago to make for the transition. What happened?

Did the American government plan on keeping the islands as an American territory like Hawaii until the Filipinos desire for independence (which is why they sided with America during the war in the first place) became too much to bare or did the process just get bogged down by bureaucracy?
