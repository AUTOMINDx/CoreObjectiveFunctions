The term "incel"
I always get an icky feeling when someone uses the term incel. How do they think they're entitled to having sex? Not having sex is the status quo! And having sex is not a price for being nice or manipulating a woman well enough to make her have sex with you. Somehow the term is inherently misogynistic but I can't put it quite into words.
What do you think of this? How are people not ashamed of using this term? And do you have a better way of phrasing this?
