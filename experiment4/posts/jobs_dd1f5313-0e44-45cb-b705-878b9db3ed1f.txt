Does anybody else feel uncomfortable in open office plans?
I hate open office plans because I’m quite a private and introverted person. I used to work in one and having a conversation was torture because I just hate talking when the room is silent because I know everyone else can hear, even if they don’t care, it’s just that privacy concern. I’m the type that can’t even talk on the phone when I’m on a train carriage because people around me can hear. 

Does anybody else have this? I really like working from home now.
