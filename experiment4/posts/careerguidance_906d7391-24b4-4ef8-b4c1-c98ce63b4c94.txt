Should I take a fully remote job making 60k out of college as an operations analyst, go to grad school immediately for an MBA, or try to secure a higher-paying TPM role?
So, I am a senior graduating May 2022. I recently got an offer for 60k per year with benefits from a big tech company as an operations analyst and would be working fully remote in a LCOL area (parent's house). The role and team is not something I am enthusiastic about since it doesn't seem interesting.

I also feel like this role will pigeonhole me and make it difficult to transition to PM/TPM. Everyone that I have met throughout my recruiting process has been tremendously encouraging, nice, and helpful to me from start to finish compared to other companies.

I have been thinking about going to grad school to get my MBA, especially if I don't get a good job by the time I graduate. I want to get into PM/TPM as well become an executive (C-suite, VP) one day so that's the main reason for the MBA. I have a 3.9 GPA and will be earning 2 bachelors degrees (computer science and business).

I have been in touch with a higher-up at a large company who tried to get me to join for an internship (had already accepted another offer) but is trying now to get me to join for new grad. They will be helping me get a TPM role after the holidays and have me meet another higher-up who will tell me exactly what I would be doing. This has me excited since the team does impressive work in technology. I feel I have a solid chance.

My question is, if you were in my shoes or those of you who have experience, should I take the operations analyst role or take another route? Thoughts?

UPDATE â€“ I cannot thank you all enough for y'alls thoughts and discussions which have been of great quality! I am still reading through each of the comments. Also added clarify about my degrees here since it was asked quite a bit.
