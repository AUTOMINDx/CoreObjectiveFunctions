How can a therapist help me with this? Is it even worth bringing up? My last therapist just gasped and then we never talked about it again.
So this is embarrassing lol but I make myself sleep with a much older man so that I can have the friendship. I hate the sex and I want to vomit but I do enjoy the friendship. I have autism and AVPD (avoidant personality disorder) so it’s super hard for me to connect with new people and make friends. I practically don’t leave the house and my nonexistent social skill make it near impossible. 

Is this worth bringing up? I mean honestly - how can they possibly help me? I’m in therapy already addressing self worth issues, so I’m not sure if this extra detail will add anything. What would a therapist do in this situation if a client said what I did? *Also for clarification, I’m over 18.
