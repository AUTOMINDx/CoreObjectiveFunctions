Don't tell anyone that you find them unattractive because of the way their body looks
Recently someone in this sub [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/r8zcyi/should_i_23m_tell_a_girl_25f_i_saw_for_three/), if he should tell the girl that he does not want to continue dating her, because he thinks that she looks ugly. One of the top comments was: "Bro you do that, she will think about it for the rest of her life". Guess what - yesterday a girl told me after a pretty short date that she (25F, 153cm) finds me unattractive because I'm too short (I'm 28M and 165cm) for her preference. I did not asked for any feedback from her side, and as most already said in the other comment, it indeed ruined at least yesterday for me. I mean I know already that I'm far from being the tallest, and that some women prefer for obvious reasons taller guys - so no reason to remind me about it! But yeah, no worries, I'm sure I'll get over it soon. 
But please everyone - never tell anyone what you find ugly about them! If they ask, and you know something they could change, go for it, but otherwise please no.

That's all I have to say for today, I wish you all a very wonderful start to the week, take care, and keep your heads up high!! :)
