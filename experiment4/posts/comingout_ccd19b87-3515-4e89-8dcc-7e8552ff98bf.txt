Married and bi.
F(22) married to M (23). We’ve been together for 2 years. About a 8 months ago I came out to him as bisexual. Something I’ve suppressed my entire life due to family and fear of judgement. 

Husband took news well, with full acceptance. Recently, Husband has pitched the idea of me exploring my sexuality (emotionally and physically) without it doing damage to our relationship and having his opinion open. Which I would want his opinion. I don’t want to have an affect on our relationship but I also am curious about it. Also my fear is offending someone in the LGBT community. 

Any advice or stories is welcome.
