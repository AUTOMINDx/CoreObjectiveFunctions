Philosophers who combine ideas of individualism/liberty with collectivism?
When I say collectivism here, I don't mean it in the sense of the group necessarily having priority over the individual. I mean it more in the sense that each individual has autonomy and freedom, however there is emphasis placed on achieving a harmonious society in which individuals work together to achieve common goals - perhaps even getting into ideas of spirituality or pantheism. 

Hope this makes sense, let me know if it sounds stupid.
