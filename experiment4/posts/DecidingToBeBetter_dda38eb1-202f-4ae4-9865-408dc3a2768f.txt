When your friends invite you to their recitals, concerts, gig, showcases, sports games, art shows, performances, etc, GO, even if the subject doesn't interest you
I promise it will mean the absolute world to them that you went. Take an hour or 2 out of your day to make your friend's whole week. It will make them feel great, they will appreciate your support, and it will strengthen your relationship. Plus who knows, you might end up really liking the thing they invited you to.
