Best friend invites my best friend but not me to outings. What should I do?
So I introduced my childhood friend, lets call him Ned to my highschool best friend Alexa a couple of years ago. They became super tight which was awesome but recently I've noticed they've excluded me from a lot things like discord hangouts like we used to do every night. We would always hang out as a group and NEVER leave anyone out. But I realised they've slowly stopped inviting me to things. I find out they have their own discord calls. They stream movies without me. Other times they play games without me or make plans.   


I caught them out one time and asked  why they didn't invite me and they just made up silly bullshit excuses. But what I hate is that when i invite ONLY Ned to some events he always asks me to ensure i invite Alexa every time or else she'll get upset. But whenever he's invited to do things with Alexa...they never bother asking me.   


Recently I invited Alexa and Ned to my xmas day family party and Alexa said she couldn't come. But on Xmas eve she invited him over to her familys dinner but didnt even invite me...am I a toxic friend for feeling upset about this? I feel as if our friendship is divided and there's an imbalance in treatment here. What should I do?   


P.S They're not going out. They both told me many times..Ive asked
