Haven’t left the house in a year
I’m 21 F was diagnosed with agoraphobia at 16 but my mom didn’t care to help. She would emotionally abuse me and yell at me if I panicked . And now she’s upset that I don’t leave the house. I now developed Obsessive compulsive disorder now revolving around worrying if I cheated on my partner. That with my unsupportive drug addict alcoholic trailer trash family I don’t see a purpose in life. I also have a dad who never talks to me .
