Beyond who owns the means of production, what do think is the important difference between capitalism vs socialism?
In discourse and debate, I think the meanings and paradigms of capitalism and socialism is obfuscated, especially when we talk about social services.

I ask beyond who owns the means of production because I think there are core dynamics/values that are at the heart of discussions and debates beyond who owns the tools to make widgets.
