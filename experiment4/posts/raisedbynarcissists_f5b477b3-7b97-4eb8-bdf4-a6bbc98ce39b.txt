My mom got Covid and she’s just sitting in our living room coughing all over everything.
I feel like I’m about to go fucking insane. I can’t believe how fucking selfish she’s being right now. She can’t be fucking bothered to pick her ass up and sit in her room three feet away from her throne chair instead of infecting the rest of us. But no, she’s sick so that means the rest of us have to suffer. 


I’m so fucking done with this family. I’m about to disown myself from this absolute insanity.
