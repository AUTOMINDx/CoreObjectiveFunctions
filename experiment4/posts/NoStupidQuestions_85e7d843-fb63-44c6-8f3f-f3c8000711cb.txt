How can the US govt place so much importance on its military, and at the same time allows a high percentage of its veteran population to be homeless? Isn't that contradictory?
"Join the military of the greatest military power in the world, you will probably end up homeless afterwards!"

How does this even make sense? Shouldn't a nation, which puts so much emphasis on the might of its military, be pouring billions into ensuring that none of its military vets end up like that?
