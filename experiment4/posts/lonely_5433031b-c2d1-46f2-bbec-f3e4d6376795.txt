Don't know what it feels like to be loved
I think the dogs I see a lot "love" me but I imagine it's not the same as love from a human. If I stopped playing with them they'd probably never look at me. 22 years on this planet and not a single genuine reciprocation. I have done so much for so many people, only to have them leave just as quick as they came. It's pretty miserable to live like this. 

I see posts saying you need to learn how to be by yourself. I know how to do that, that's what I've done for the past decade at the least. I don't want to do that anymore. I've never wanted to do that. 

I wrote a suicide note a month ago but couldn't go through with it mostly due to fear of missing out. I still have a glimmer of hope that there are actually answers to my problems. I have to believe I'll actually be happy soon, because if I don't believe that I'll be dead. 

I've lost 50 pounds. I'm pretty good at guitar after 3 years of learning. I took myself out of my comfort zone to drive 13 hours away to see my favorite band at a crazy crowded festival. Even with these changes I'm still the same: sad, alone, and suicidal. I can't even believe I've made it this long feeling like this.
