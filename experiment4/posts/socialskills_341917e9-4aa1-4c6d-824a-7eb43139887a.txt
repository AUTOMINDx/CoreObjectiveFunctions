The easy truth about social skills - what I got wrong for a lot of years and how I finally made it
Social skills were my white whale.

No matter what room I walked into, I always considered myself to be at the very bottom of the hierarchy. Non-stop second guessing about social cues. Couldn't look people in the eyes. Withdrawing was my default state. Who the hell would want to spend time around me?

As I implied, this all changed. I'll share what I was doing wrong and how I've finally made it to a point where I feel like I'm on the path to becoming above-average in socializing.

**Mistake 1: Working directly on social skills** 

Out of all the things that didn't work, this didn't work the most. It was not that I wasn't confident in social skills. I was not confident, period. 

I built confidence by challenging the places I thought I was weak, but choosing specifically the weaknesses that I thought I could beat. 

Why did I think I could beat those weaknesses? Because I could leverage my strengths to beat them.

Challenging my social skills did nothing except proliferate my weaknesses, while making use of none of my strengths. It always resulted in absolute failure (ie. giving up).

**Mistake 2: Treating failure as anything but learning** 

When you step out to learn something challenging, there is a 100% chance you will experience failure.

Why? Because you're in uncharted territory. There is no way you're going to be right every single time and if you find yourself being right every time, you're either not challenging yourself hard enough or you're lying to yourself.

Treat your failure like a scientist who is analyzing the outcome of their test. Take the learnings from the feedback and come back stronger every single time. 

**Mistake 3: Trying to quantify the amount of time and effort this will take**

These measures are indeterminable and to make matters worse, people are really bad at estimating how long something is going to take or how much energy they'll have to invest.

If anything, you're better off counting reps. I love to tell myself that I will be better on attempt 10 than I was on attempt 1. That approach always yields results because there is no pressure to get it right every single time. I just have to show up and perform at a reasonable level.

It took me about four years of *inconsistent* journeying to get from the place I described in my second paragraph to noticing that people with status want me around. And now my confidence is like a freight train- there's no stopping it. 

That means if you're in your 21 and you start this journey now, life could look a whole lot different by 24-25. 

I'm 38. You're never too old to start. 

Trailing ideas:

1. If you're reading this and thinking, "This can't be true" or "This would never work", that is a fixed mindset. It is incredibly common and I encourage you to read Mindset by Carol Dweck.  

2. Confidence is like social currency. People will forgive a lot of foibles if you're confident. I actually believe it's barely worth working on social skills at all. They come naturally with confidence.  

3. Health is huuuuuuge for confidence. Most of the people you meet are not healthy. Health is acquired through three things: proper macros, exercise, and meditation. Challenge these weaknesses early on and people will start paying attention to you in a good way.

Weaknesses I challenged:

\- ability to study effectively

\- problem solving

\- ability to throw (I looked hilariously awkward when I threw anything and avoided sports as a result.)

\- ability to understand math

\- ability to jog for up to 30 mins at a time

\- ability to design a website (big deal in a small town - big fish, small pond)

\- ability to maintain my physical appearance (hygiene, strength training, wardrobe)

\- toxic masculinity (in progress - defined as seeing the world through a win/lose lens)

\- ability to learn from mistakes

\- ability to practice effectively

\- ability to cope with stress without vices (in progress)

These are the weaknesses that kept popping up for me. Some are fairly universal, others are probably specific to me. There will be new challenges in the future.

Try it out, folks. It's the biggest gift you can give to your future self.
