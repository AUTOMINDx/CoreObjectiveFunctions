Nissen fundoplication was not as amazing as I was led to believe
Hi all, I’m new to this community and am first of all very happy to have found it. I am 23 years old and have struggled with reflux since about 9 years old. I was diagnosed with GERD and a hiatal hernia about three years ago and after a few months of being on 80 mg a day of Prilosec, my GI doctor began to get concerned on the high doses long term effects on me and recommended the Nissen fundoplication procedure to fix my hernia. I was told by my surgeon and numerous friends and family who either had the surgery or knew someone who did that it was significantly life improving but to be perfectly honest it’s been 5 months since the procedure and I can’t really say it’s improved much. While I don’t taste acid as much, I still have struggles with getting food down without getting stuck, my breath is still bad, my appetite has gone was down (after a few bites I can barely eat anymore whereas before the surgery I could put down a meal no problem!). I was also told that the surgery would make it so I wouldn’t need medication anymore, but with my symptoms slowly re-emerging I am now back on 40 mg of Prilosec daily. I don’t mean to discourage anyone, because I know this surgery is amazing for many people, but I’m pretty disappointed in the lack of results I’ve seen thus far. Has anyone else had this procedure and experienced similar effects?
