What makes an extinct language translatable, what makes one untranslatable?
We have written works of some languages that, despite being extinct, do have people who can study and understand them. To call it difficult is a huge understatement, but it has been done. It may be impossible to know how they sound, but we can at least decipher and understand what the texts are saying.  

Does it have to do with certain languages being language isolate? And if so, then what's the difference between Rongorongo (To this day untranslatable) and something like Sumerian (Which has been translated)? They're both Isolated, is this just a matter of Sumerian being from the same region as Akkadian, which wasn't isolated?
