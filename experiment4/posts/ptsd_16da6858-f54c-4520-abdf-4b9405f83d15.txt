*Just* get over it....
No I cannot *just* get over it. Yes it was real. No I cannot go back to "who I used to be". Believe me I wish more than ANYTHING that I could. I'm sick and tired of dismissive crap like this coming from people who have never experienced anything traumatic. They act like its just snap your fingers wave a damn wand so easy. There is only so much a person can take before they just snap and something in their brain just breaks...that's where I'm at and then some. My whole life just one big trauma dump. I try and try, I fight and fight, I go to therapy, psychiatrist, try meds, exercise, eat healthy. I did everything I was told to do to get better only to be fucked over again and re triggered almost daily now. I cannot *just* get over it....

I'm just having a mental breakdown sobbing my eyes out I can't see to type. **TW: Sexual/physical assault** Life is fucking cruel. After the death of so many loved ones, child abuse, homelessness as an adult, being raped and disfigured in an abusive relationship...it's just fucking cruel.
