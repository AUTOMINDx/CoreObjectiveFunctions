Pretty sure I have postpartum depression after what happened today..
I snapped today. Screaming, slamming doors, hitting walls kinda snapped. My husband, bless him, said no when I asked him for help and I lost it. He has no idea how to handle me and honestly at this point I'm not sure how to handle myself. My son is 7 months and an absolute joy and I've been okay up until a few weeks ago. I've become edgy, angry and impatient and as the days go on its getting worse. Today it all came to a head. Luckily I was able to get a doctors appointment for a week from now but a week seems like an eternity if I'm going to feel worse than I do today. Any tips on getting thru the next 7 days without ending my marriage?
