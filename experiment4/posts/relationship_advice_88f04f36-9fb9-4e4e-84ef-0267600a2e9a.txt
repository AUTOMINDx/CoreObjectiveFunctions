Don't know how to restart my life after being deported at 33
Hey.

I am about to be deported from Sweden due to Brexit.

I have lived here for 7-years, under EU law. However, Sweden threw some extra requirements for Brits that wanted long-term residency, and thus I have to leave.

I have had a long goodbye with my girlfriend and friends. It hurt so fucking much.

However, I am now faced with the prospect of restarting my life at 33-years-old.

My entire life has been in Sweden, and thus this is terrifying for me.

I have no friends back in the UK. No job. No credit history. Nothing.

How the fuck do I get through this?
