Need advice for coping
TW:⚠️⚠️⚠️ everything about this is triggering to me, so warning but if you can offer any advice at all I would greatly appreciate it.

I’ve been no contact since October 2020 when my narcissistic father violently shook me… I was 8 weeks pregnant and when I reminded him of that he said I wouldn’t care if you were 8 months pregnant. I had always pushed everything under the rug because we had money and “it could be worse” but I draw the line at my baby. I stood up for my baby the way my mother never stood up for me. Following that incident I had several complications during pregnancy and my baby was born only 4lbs. It’s a miracle I didn’t miscarry.

He has never met my daughter and will never meet her.

I’m really broken from everything. My mom is a typical 1950’s housewife and is staying by his side. It’s like the the foundation of my upbringing is crumbling. 

Any advice or stories would help.
