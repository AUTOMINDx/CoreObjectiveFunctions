[MA] Employer is forcing me to take time off but is also using my earned time.
I work at a hospital and whenever we’re sick we’re required to call out of work and call our occupational health department to schedule a Covid test even if your Covid test comes back negative you’re not allowed to go back to work until the OHS department says you can so you call every day and they say if you can go back to work or not based on your symptoms. If they don’t let you go back to work they don’t give you the option to take the day unpaid they use your earn time
