Who to put as a reference when apply for a job?
I am in my mid-20s. For the past 4 years I have been self-employed.  I want to start apply for different jobs as I'm not enjoying my work anymore. 

Before being self-employed, I had a temporary (Christmas) job at a supermarket. I didn't leave on good terms with them. They were trying to get me to work 7 nights a week, wouldn't take no for an answer so I quit. Plus, I was only there 4 months and it was several years ago so the managers probably don't even remember me to give a reference for my work.

Previous to that I worked at a pet store for 2 years but again the owner was funny with me after I told them I was leaving. I was unemployed for a while before that (around 18 months). My first job I worked at a dog rescue kennel. The owner was great and did say she would happily give me a reference, but I haven't spoken to her in around 9 years so I'm not sure if I should put her as a reference/if it would hold any value.

I do volunteer for a charity, could I ask the people who run the group if they would be willing to give me a reference if needed? Is there anyone else I could ask?
