i only believe in science BUT it crazy how accurate this shit is and i can't ignore it, is there any scientific explanations ??
i am a pisces, i used to read astrology just for fun but lately i've been reading about non-pisces talking about their pisces friends/lovers and i noticed that these complete strangers mentionned about how pisces almost always suffer from some kind of mental issues, substance abuse, super emotional and can't handle their emotions, emotionally manipulative, obsessive, empaths, they LOVE escarping reality and i was shocked ? i suffer from borderline personality disorder and ocd, i abuse drugs, i am super emotional, daydreaming is my hobby... how can this be ?
