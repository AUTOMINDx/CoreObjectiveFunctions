Do the holidays bring out the worst in you?
Its taken most of my adult life to realize that I have big avoidance energy - I avoid all my problems. Its my least favorite thing about myself, and my guess is that it goes back to my mom's anger issues. 

For as long as I can remember, starting at a very young age, she would corner me and just yell her head off for twenty minutes straight. Sometimes she'd trick me into going for a ride in the car, but then she'd pull over and scream at me halfway through. She has a couple of DUIs - please don't even ask me about driving with her as a kid. 

So I basically learned to "play dead" during her temper tantrums. My dad would leave for days on end whenever she'd try this on him, so she usually unloaded on me &amp; my brothers instead.

Fast forward to present day, &amp; the stress of the holidays has me avoiding people &amp; issues like crraazyy lately... I haven't responded to any work emails in about a week. I haven't called my friend who's left me two voicemails. I haven't done a damn thing except make and mail cookies lol.

So here I am avoiding everything except for cookies and of course Reddit =) Anyone else feel like the holidays (or, let's face it, stress in general) brings out your least favorite personality traits?

Edit: how do you deal..?
