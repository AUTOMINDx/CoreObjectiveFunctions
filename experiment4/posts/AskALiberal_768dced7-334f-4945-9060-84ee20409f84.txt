Does anyone still think 1/6 caused a significant number of conservatives to leave the GOP?
I saw a lot of articles and online chatter about how 1/6 could and/or would lead to a fracturing of the Republican Party as the less Trump inclined would finally decide enough is enough and wrest back control. 

A small number of Republican politicians condemned it but none with any sort of real power/influence in 2021 did. The base has remained stable. 

While there was some initial shock and surprise it has largely given way to whataboutism regarding BLM protests and/or complaints about Dems giving 1/6 too much priority and it’s just best to move on. 

However, some still hold on to the position that a mostly silent group of reasonable Republicans is waiting to take “their party” back. What is this based on?
