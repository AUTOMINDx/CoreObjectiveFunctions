Would you be ok with a guy who hit the wall when he's mad?
Can you accept this behavior? 

Context is that he saw me chatting with one of my guy friends. I think he became really insecure because he's a new friend I made in med school and a bunch of us really just chat online while studying. He must've got worried or jumped to the conclusion that I'm getting (too) close with him. So he immediately punched the wall next to him. I was surprised and told him there's nothing more. 

We have been unofficially dating / hanging out but not officially bf/gf yet. 

Now I'm starting to have second thoughts About progressing with him. 


He's never been violent with me but that sudden expression of anger surprised me And came outa nowhere without even talking to me / asking me about it. 

Does anyone else's boyfriend do this?

Edit: did anyone else's ex boyfriend do this and did it ever escalate to more violence?
