Me when I find out an acquaintance has other people in their life and actually goes out and does things

(I am being sarcastic but the amount of betrayal I feel over someone I met 2 weeks ago mentioning a random person and I don't even know them, probably highlights my lack of social interaction rather than my possessiveness)

Plus everyone I wanted to hang out with, all cancelled their plans in the past month. I have not spoken to a person properly other than my parents in several weeks. Living the life 😍🙏
