Men what’s something you wish you could do without having your sexuality or masculinity questioned?
In conclusion: Men and society hold men to unrealistic standards based on peer pressure from other men even when it’s detrimental, some of these answers were really sad because they were things that I just do and don’t think twice about. A lot of these answers were just basic self expression like crying and doing creative things or wearing what you want.

It’s like for us women we are expected to be pretty and provide kids at the cost of safety, ie being followed In public and stalked. 

Men are expected to be whatever society deems as manly at the cost of being themselves and being a full formed human being.
