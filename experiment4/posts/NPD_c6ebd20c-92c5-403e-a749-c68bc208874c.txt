We are not special.
On grandiosity.
Do we make better coffee than pro baristas? No.
Can we cook better than Chef Ramsay? No.
Are we geniuses to the standard of Einstein and Hawking? No. 
Are we the ABSOLUTE BEST at work? No.

So we are not better than other people.
But we do WANT to be better, and that's okay.
Being 'Great' is not an attainable status. It is a process.
And its also OKAY to be like everybody else. 

On entitlement.
If we are as good as anybody else, then we also don't deserve more than others. 
Think you deserve a better job? Go get it. 
But if you don't get it, its okay. 
Because we're not more deserving than other people.
Others strive and achieve too. 

As we walk around today, look at the normal random people around us and think: "I am as good as them but not better".

May we find peace with our delusions, for to be 'Great' we must overcome our weaknesses. 

We are not special.
