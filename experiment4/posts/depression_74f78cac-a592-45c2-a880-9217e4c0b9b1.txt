Ending it
Nobody will read this, and that's okay.

I'm done. Some people have purpose or meaning to their lives, but mine has always been this cesspool of depression and anxiety, and I can't do it anymore.

I doubt anyone will notice I'm gone.

EDIT: Still somewhat new to Reddit, so I don't know if this is the best way/place to make a revision to my original post, but I am incredibly overwhelmed by all of the love, support, compassion, and empathy everyone has shown me. I can't even begin to express my gratitude to all of you. I'm still here because of the loving support I received from all of you. Thank you. I'm sorry to be a burden and such a downer.
