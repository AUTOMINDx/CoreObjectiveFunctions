Is having a pet engaging in animal slavery?
You buy a pet, it has no choice but to come and live with you, can we even consider a pet to be able to give consent to ownership?  Even if the pet has a better life, if it could never consent to ownership it would still be slavery?

These thoughts were kinda inspired from some of the arguments for veganism I had read where the blurry line between what we actually consider an animal/human is often used to point out hypocrisy in meat-eaters arguments.
