Tired of being the only adult in my family
My dad has been an alcoholic my whole life. Constant drinking was part of the man-culture of my hometown and particularly embedded in my dad’s family. My dad didn’t hit us and wasn’t verbally abusive but my parents’ relationship was volatile and explosive. My mom would leave all the time and I’d never know if she’d come back. My dad would disappear for hours anytime he could and return blitzed. My parents would get mad at one another and ignore me — literally refusing to speak to me when they weren’t speaking to one another. When I moved away as an adult, they’d call me during their arguments and scream at me about the other one until I told them if I’m they ever did it again I’d never speak to them from that point on.

I have my own family now and haven’t lived close to my parents for two decades but I certainly still struggle with the effects of growing up like this. I am a workaholic perfectionist with anxiety. I’ve been in therapy and it’s helped a lot but I am angry and having trouble letting it go. I’m realizing that I’m most angry that I have been the adult in my relationship with my parents for my whole life. They defer to me on everything. They can’t cope with their emotions and need to be down regulated. They make childish decisions. I am clearly the leader of this triad and I hate it. I know I am the enabler because I allow it but I am stuck. I moved hundreds of miles away to get away from this dynamic. I worked my butt off to succeed despite them. I have devoted myself to being a better parent and partner. But I struggle to overcome this dynamic with my parents or the anger I have that they haven’t been adults my whole life. 

Can anyone relate to this child-is-the-adult-to-the-parent dynamic?
