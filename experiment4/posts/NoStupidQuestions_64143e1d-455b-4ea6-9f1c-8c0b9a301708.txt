Am I stupid for asking this question?
Today in math class I asked the teacher why a circle is divided into 360 degrees, and why they didn’t make it 100 or 500 or any other number of degrees. He explained that the 3 angles of a triangle always add up to 180 and 180 is half of 360. I said “yes but why 360 degrees?” And the teacher said “because 360 degrees makes a circle!” And the whole class laughed at me. I think they either all misunderstood the question or I am the stupidest person on planet earth and haven’t figured out this obvious issue.
