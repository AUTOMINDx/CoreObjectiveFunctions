psychiatrist has admitted she doesn't know how to help me
i (19F) have caused my psych to be torn between three possible diagnosis's - bipolar 2, schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, and bpd. i've tried probably 10-15 different medications (in combination with weekly therapy) and none have worked for me at all.

i had a session today and she was visibly frustrated/stumped and just finally confessed that she didn't know how to treat me.

some of my symptoms include auditory, tactile and visual hallucinations, intense mood swings multiple times a day, self harm, impulsivity, periods of psychosis, constant vivid intrusive thoughts that leave me distressed for days, splitting, and seemingly some medicine resistance to name the most prominent issues. so i can understand how all these overlapping symptoms can be difficult to work with, especially with no medicine working for me yet.

she's also brought up the possibility of have schizoaffective disorder and bpd, which i just don't even wanna think about that.

but it feels like she's giving up on me and i'm not sure what to do. she's recommended admitting myself several times in the past but i'm not actively suicidal - sure i have lots of thoughts of it when i get into extremely low moods, but i don't have any intention of going through with it.

what should i do? should i look for a new psychiatrist? wait this out? accept the fact that i'm seemingly untreatable?

i'm at a loss...
