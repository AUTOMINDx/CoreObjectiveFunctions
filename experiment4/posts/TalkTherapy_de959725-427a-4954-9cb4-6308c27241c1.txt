I want to have sex with my therapist.
For the first time in two years, I have finally found a therapist who is validating, compassionate, non-judgmental, and remembers almost everything I say. Last month I opened up to him about how I feel the need to act/dress sexual around him and he never once shamed me. He instead thanked me and validated my feelings. 

I now feel like I have sexual and romantic feelings for him and I want to tell him. Now I know people say it’s a bad thing to have sex with your therapist but what’s the worst that could happen? I’m not saying he would because he is very ethical and would probably enforce the boundaries in that session, but I’m still curious.

If you’re a therapist, have you ever encountered a client who told you something like this and if so, how did you respond?

If you’re a client, did you ever tell your therapist you wanted to have sex with them and if so, how did they respond? Good or bad? Ethical/unethical?
