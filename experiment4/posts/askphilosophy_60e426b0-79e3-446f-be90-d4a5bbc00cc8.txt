Why is philosphical writing so difficult to read?
Background: I am NOT someone who regularly reads philosophical writings, but I'm learning about it and I have many issues. My field of work is in military intelligence, and our primary goal is to make overly complex topics simplified for the regular person to understand to make critical decisions.

My issue with philosophical writing: Unless you have studied and have a strong grasp on the subtle nuances in philosophical writing, this shit is impossible to understand. For example, in the Second Formulation of the Categorial Imperative, it commonly refers to the phrase, "treating someone as an ends." I instantly thought; "okay, in what way are you USING that word???" NOWHERE in the writing does it actually break down the usage of the word "ends" in this case.

By making the reader assume an understanding of phrases and words up to their own interpretation in philosophical writing, you lose all clarity to make a decent decision as a result. I apologize if it seems like I'm bashing philosophy, but I wanted to see if anyone else had these issues.

Edit: These replies are awesome and I really appreciate you all taking me seriously and helping me understand. Easily one of the most professional subreddits I've ever encountered. My interpretation now, is that philosophical writing may be at the justice of the time that it was written, and therefore some modern philosophers will go the lengths to try and translate the writing to be interpreted easier. I also saw a comment that suggested that philosophy is more of a discipline, and therefore requires knowledge of previous readings. Anyways, thank you all for helping me. I'm going to continue going with my studies and maybe be less critical and more analytical going forward.
