My weight does not mean I have an eating disorder!
Ever since I first got sick a couple of years ago I have been struggling to keep my weight up for one reason or another. I was pretty proactive about it and as soon as the weight loss was symptomatic I discussed it with my GP and a dietician.

At the moment my nausea makes it pretty difficult for me to eat a ‘normal’ diet. When I eat in front of people their eyebrows raise when they see my portion size or they mutter something under their breath. Whilst I’ve been home for the holidays my family are constantly commenting on what and how much I’m eating.

Please tell me I’m not the only one with physical illness related weight problems that deals with other people’s shitty assumptions as a consequence...

TLDR: I am fed up of shitty assumptions that I have an ED when I can’t help that my physical illnesses impact my weight
