It's true: want a great raise, get a new job
My boss has been pissing me off about one issue but I hadn't been motivated enough to leave.   Cushy job, super easy commute.  Changed at the end of October with one incident.

Started putting out resumes at the start of November.  I just got a job with much better benefits, unlimited PTO and fully remote with a 31% raise.

I accidentally saw what my \*fantastic\* raise was going to be this year after taking on HR and all benefit administration in addition to my regular duties.  4%  Plus I'm in the office every single day.  Better be there 40 hours too.  Though others don't have to be but that's different.

**You are WORTH the effort to find someone who will pay you more.**
