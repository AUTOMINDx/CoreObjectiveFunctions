Thank you socially akward people!
To all socially conflicted/awkward people here, THANK YOU. I do not ever post, only read and comment, and I can't tell you enough how thankful I am for having found this sub. Reading all your posts help me appreciate that it is not just me having these thoughts, feel like going crazy because I'm surrounded by "normal" social people. I found here that we are quite a lot, so I never feel alone. I was afraid to tell others how I felt, but again, seeing you all here and commenting helped me realize there's more like me than I thought, and not only "conflicted", but helpful. You are all here for each other, and I can't thank you enough.
