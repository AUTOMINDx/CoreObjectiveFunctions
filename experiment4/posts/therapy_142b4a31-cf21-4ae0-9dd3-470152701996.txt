Therapist says I got raped? Feel like they are "talking me into trauma"
May be a bit of a weird one. Am I being delusional? some details about the event below, skip to the last alinea if you don't feel like reading that.

The first time I ever had sex, it was a random guy who asked if he could sleep at my couch because he missed the last bus home after a party. I was very drunk. When we got home, it became obvious he wanted sex. I wanted it at first, because I had never had sex and wanted to experience it. Before it started I asked him "you will stop if I tell you, right?" and he agreed. I was shivering the whole time. It hurt like shit and bleeded a lot. Then I asked him to stop, which he did for a few minutes, then started again. He had not once asked my consent.

So basically this event is stored in my mind as "oh well it is my own fault for getting so drunk / not saying "no" clear enough / inviting him into my house / not noticing his intentions" as well as "it was only sex, nothing too bad". But now my therapist has called it rape, which I find a very serious word. It is now constantly in my head, even though before I told my therapist I never thought twice about what happened. So I now basically feel worse. I still believe it is my own fault and was not traumatic. Am I under-reacting?
