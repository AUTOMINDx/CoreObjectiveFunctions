What is healthcare for women like in your country ?
How easy/hard is it to get care if you don't have insurance ? What happens if you are suspecting something but your doctor ignored your concerns . Can you find a second doctor easily or is it a long hassle ? What if you are suspecting something and want to get tested but your doctor doesn't agree. Do you always have to go through the doctor ? In my country it's quite easy if you are middle class or above . Even if your doctor might not agree , you can still get tested at an independent laboratory . What if you are an immigrant and want to take consultation from doctor in your home country but the medication are available through prescription only . Do you still get your medicine ?
