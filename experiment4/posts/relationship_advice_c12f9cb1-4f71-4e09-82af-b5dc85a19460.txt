Found out she cheated on me. How can I cope with this in a healthy way
This is kinda an update post towards figuring out my love F(24) M(24) of 9 yrs had an affair. We talked about it and I given her choices to make and in the end she chose to work on our relationship at the expense of it happening again I would definitely leave. I try my best to get through the day with her happily but I know this lingering effect will stay for awhile as it tends to bug me and come out in a bad way.

P.S the advice I've received during this time has really help me think things through and come up with the best possible/prepared solutions.
