‘Everyone has an off day’ but how many off days is too many?
Not sure if this is the best place for this but here goes.

I’ve been at my job for about 8 months and I enjoy it 90% of the time. However, there’s simply not enough of us and the workload can be intense. I’m a junior graphic designer and often concepts are needed yesterday. With this type of workload it can be difficult to be creative and really explore the best option.

I feel like I’m underperforming and not coming up with good enough concepts quick enough. (My boss or coworkers have not said this to me, but I’m consistently receiving feedback to try something different or do x,y or z instead). The feedback itself doesn’t bother me/I don’t take it personally - but should I be being asked so much to do something differently? 

So: ‘everyone has an off day’ - I feel like I’ve been having a lot of these. How many off days is too many before you admit defeat that you’re not that good at your job?
