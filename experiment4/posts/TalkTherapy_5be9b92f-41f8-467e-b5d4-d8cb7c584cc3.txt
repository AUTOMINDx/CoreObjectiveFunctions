I emailed like 10 therapists and heard nothing back, is this normal?
I want to start therapy for the first time after experience a break up to help prevent myself from spiraling into a depression like I have in the past. I emailed 10 therapists in my area a couple weeks ago and only heard back from 1 with a curt email telling me she wasn’t accepting new clients. 

I have heard nothing back from the others. Is this normal? 

I emailed them through a website so maybe they didn’t get it? Are my problems not good enough? Is it just because of the holidays? Should I follow up or just start trying other therapists?
