Why have speed limits not changed, despite automotive performance &amp; safety making progress?
I’ve done a fair bit of survey staking &amp; engineering documentation in the Civil &amp; Structural field. I also build &amp; tune street cars as a hobby.

How is it that safety &amp; performance of vehicles has made tremendous progress, but are still bound to 20th century regulations? You can walk onto a new car lot and buy an econo-box that will top out at 135mph. You can buy sports cars capable of 180mph and engineered to travel that safely.

If that car has the capability to reach that speed in OEM condition, wouldn’t it be safe to the vehicle was engineered &amp; tested to travel that speed? Also I understand civil engineering standards have improved. For example, SUDAS (the state I use to do surveying in) has been improved upon and new construction is held to a higher standard. So wouldn’t it be considered safer?

The interstate was built in the 60’s, yet the speed limit hasn’t fluctuated much. My state (Montana) ran a “safe &amp; prudent” speed limit up until the late 90’s, but still it’s 20mph faster than neighboring states.

So what’s the limiting factor? Is it the standard at with we license drivers? How does the EU make it work?
