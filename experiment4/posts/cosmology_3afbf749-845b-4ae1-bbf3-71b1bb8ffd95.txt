My proposed #SuperCyclicalTheory
Let me get this straight I am a total layperson when it comes to this topic but like everything else in the world I find interest here too.

Could the universe be bouncing back and forth between a matter and antimatter universe? I will call it a #SuperCyclicalTheory. Conversely matter can be condensed into black holes or a big crunch to create an antimatter universe.

I was listening to Penrose try to describe his mathematical approach to the state of the universe before the Big Bang.... 

Yes there is no Universe until the Big Bang... or is there a collapsing antimatter universe. Could this be the process that generates a multiverse foam ...

My thinking is that maybe space-time is universal between a matter and antimatter reality... and that the energy necessary to create the Big Bang may possibly come from antimatter collapsing in on itself.

One thing is for sure my novice theory obeys the idea of supersymmetry... lol
