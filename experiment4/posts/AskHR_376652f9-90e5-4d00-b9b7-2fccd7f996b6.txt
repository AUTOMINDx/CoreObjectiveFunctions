[CA] I, a manager, am getting put on a 30 day write up after a PIP retaliated before leaving
I've been on Reddit enough to have seen "HR is not on my side" so I'm asking for advice on what I should watch out for, not discuss, or approach to answering questions.

The summary is that a direct report was PIP'ed, let's call him "Jim", because he was consistently late and not around when they were needed. He 'failed' that PIP and knew it, so before he was terminated he filed a grievance against me that HR had to follow through.

I met with HR to discuss Jim's complaints. He screen-shotted electronic conversations clipped out of context. I provided context and whole conversations and I believe I provided clarity. I admit that I did participate, not start, in conversations that can be seen as not work safe or befitting a manager. An example would be after a recent award show, my reports were discussing an actress's red carpet dress in chat. This lead to them commenting on nice cleavage and discussing if they were real. I did not tell them to stop and I commented "Google images is your friend. I'm pretty sure those are chest upgrades". This was clipped out of context and of course now I can see how that was not appropriate.

After my meeting with HR on a Monday, they said they would go back to Jim and move from there. That Wednesday Jim voluntarily put in their 2 weeks. During those weeks I, assuming Jim too, was instructed not to communicate further unless in a team setting. Fast forward and Jim has left.

Today, as a "heads-up" from my supervisor, I was told that HR had to write me up for using company messaging for things other than work. He said that's their reasoning behind it and it did stem from the fact they had to document the grievance.

We're meeting tomorrow and again would like advice on what I should watch out for, not discuss, and approaches to answering things.

Thanks!
