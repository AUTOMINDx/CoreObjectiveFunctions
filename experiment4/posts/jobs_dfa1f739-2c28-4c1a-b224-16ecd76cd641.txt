Why can’t we say we want the job because of money?
I was trained to provide bigger purposes whenever asked about why I want a job or what my career goal is, such as being passionate about the industry, what I do, influencing people etc. 

Where in reality my goal is to climb the corporate ladder, make more money, in a job that’s not too boring, have some work life balance. I try to stick to an industry not because I love it but because my experience is worth more money due to industry experience. 

Why is it bad to admit I’m money driven? It’s not the sole factor but probably the top 2. Aren’t most people like me? Do interviewers really believe that I’m not after the money?
