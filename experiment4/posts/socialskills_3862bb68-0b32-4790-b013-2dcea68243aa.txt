New board game friend looks down on 'fun games' and possibly me too
Looking for validation I suppose? I'm 26F and not any kind of "active member" of a board game community. But I love to play all kinds of board games from Life to Gloomhaven. A lot of my friends are similar, although most of the time we get together and we play Jackbox and just laugh and hang out. I made a couple of new friends and found out they love board games too and even a lot of the same ones I do. Recently, I've tried to suggest when we get together, that we don't always have to go hard and play a 3-8 hour strategy game. Friend A always gets weird about it and skirts the topic, despite saying he likes "party games". 

One day I finally was like, hey let's play this jackbox game it'll be fun! (group of 4) I could feel resistence, but we played and it was so much fun! We were ALL dying laughing. After one short round, I suggest playing another. Friend A shrugs and is like "it's a fun...... Party game" and gets weird and starts acting like he wasn't just laughing and having fun moments ago. 

Since then, I've heard him say that several times when we try to bring a party game. "it's a fun party game." I just don't understand where this is coming from? I feel like I can't get any kind of read on the situation when we are having fun and then suddenly he acts like he would rather chew glass.

I try not to suggest them often anymore because I feel like he is really looking down on these games. It kind of makes me feel like he thinks less of me for enjoying them so much. I just think it's more fun sometimes to just hang out with your friends and not have to think so hard for hours without conversing with each other at all.

Can anyone tell me what the deal is here? Politely asking for kind answers only please
