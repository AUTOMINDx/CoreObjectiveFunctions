Should I tell my boss I’m depressed?
I (f22) have worked at my job for almost two years. Last month my dad passed away and two weeks later my uncle passed away. I’m being forced to sell my childhood home as well. Needless to say, I am extremely depressed and my work performance has not been up to par as usual. My boss hasn’t said this to me, but I can tell by looking at own work and timeliness. I work from home, so no one can see that I cry literally all day while running excel sheets and making PTTs at my desk. I’m struggling with seeing the importance of the tasks I do, as I’ve been focusing on the meaning of life on a larger scale. Anyway- my boss knows of the deaths in my family. I took a week and a half off and he gave his condolences. We haven’t talked about it since. I don’t want to trauma dump on him and make him uncomfortable but I also want to explain myself.
