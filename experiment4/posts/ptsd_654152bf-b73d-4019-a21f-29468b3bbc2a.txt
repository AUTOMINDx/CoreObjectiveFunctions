Does anyone know you have PTSD?
Nobody knows what I struggle with, because I can't physically discuss it. The diagnosis itself feels so intertwined with the Event that I tear up even talking about the diagnosis.

Literally my spouse and boss are the only ones (outside of professionals) who know, and even my boss only knows following my first episode at work. When I tried to explain I have PTSD I cried so hard I couldn't even talk and had to write it in email instead.

I sometimes wish others knew, especially when I have flare ups but I just can't bring myself to tell anyone.

It's been 14 years, and sometimes I feel like it's festering instead of healing.
