Hiding your fears from family
I just needed a safe space to share this information with. In October of 2020 I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features (delusions and paranoia), panic disorder with agoraphobia, GAD, and social anxiety. Only my husband and my immediate family knows so they understand and get it for the most part. They couldn’t be more loving and supportive. My husbands family does not know but I can’t help but think that they have to know (even though my husband tells me they don’t have a clue) that something is up because I went from being around them for every major holiday and occasional casual get togethers or events to avoiding holidays and events for the last two years. I kept hoping they would just assume I was busy with work or want to stay away during the pandemic to not affect them but the longer this goes on the more it’s killing me. His family is very very small. It’s mainly just his grandparents, and sister and her family (husband and two kids). I’ve been able to be around them a few times separately (like just his grandparents or just his brother in law who helps my husband out a lot with big projects) and have been able to get through without an episode. But I’ve avoided get togethers because I can’t handle being around that many people. I know it’s only 6 (not including me and my husband). It seems like there’s no way to go about this because I don’t want them to know yet I don’t want them to think I hate them or don’t want to see them. I already feel like they think the latter….and then I just cry so hard thinking about how I’m treating them. But that’s not even enough to get me to go. 

I’m not really looking for advice here, just someone who will listen who’s maybe been there or won’t judge me.
