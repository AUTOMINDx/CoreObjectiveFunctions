Why are Capricorns, Aquarians, and Scorpios so cold?
I have a friend who has Cap sun, Virgo moon, and Scorpio rising. She was born in the Cap-Aquarius cusp, and has an aquarius stellium in the 3rd house with - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus. Everything else in cap and scorpio.

She is brutally cold, literally an emotionless demon. Myself and our mutual friends think there is something wrong with her - she drops/cuts off people as if she has never met them. Wtf?

Are these placements all like that???
