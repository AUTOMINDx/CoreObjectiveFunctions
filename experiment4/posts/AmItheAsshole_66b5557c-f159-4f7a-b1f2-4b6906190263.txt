AITA for making my boyfriend eat meat at my family gathering even though he's vegetarian?
My boyfriend (24) and I (28) have been together for two years. Yesterday, we were visiting my family because we won't be able to be with them on Christmas, so we wanted to drop off some presents. It was also the first time that my boyfriend met my entire family, so it was kinda important.

Here's the thing, I forgot to tell them that my boyfriend is vegetarian, so my mom made a turkey and there wasn't really anything else to eat, beside some snacks. When I realized that, I quietly asked my boyfriend to please not cause a scene, and just eat the food and compliment my mom on it. He tried to argue back, saying that he doesn't wants to lie to my mom but I told him he would come across as rude if he didn't atleast tried it, and I didn't wanted him to make a bad impression. So he sucked it up, ate an entire plate and told my mom that it was delicious, which obviously made her happy.

We had a good evening and everyone seemed to like him, but when we drove back home he brought it up again and said he thinks it was kinda fucked up of me to expect him to eat meat, when I know how much it disgusts him. I get his point and I apologized to him, bit I still don't think that it's *that bad* to eat a bit of turkey once, to not make a weird first impression on my family. AITA?

edit: a few people are asking why there was nothing else that he could've eaten and like I said, there were of course some other snacks and a couple of different sauces, but nothing that would've been considered a decent meal without the turkey.
