I'm not actually a good person
I like being around people, I find them interesting and fun to watch, and sometimesyou can have a fun conversation, but it is exhausting to be around them.

Well, I think I realized why its so exhausting. I frequently get called a "kind person", "super caring and nice", "very polite". But, Its literally all an act. People want to see a kind, polite, and happy-go-lucky person who will do anything without question, so thats what I show them. For example, whenever my mom has the parent-teacher conferences, all the teachers will say how polite and nice I am, and how I'm a great kid and am very caring towards my classmates. But thats not me. Its a persona I've created. 

In reality, I could literally care less about most of those people. I have no interest in talking to them, and I even find their kindness towards me a bit annoying/uncomfortable. But its weird because while I don't CARE about them, I do feel something kinda like caring. It feels like an obligation. Like I **have** to be nice to these people, and I **have** to try my best to make them feel good.

If I see someone sad, its its like I can feel their sadness. If I see someone mad, I can feel their anger. This makes me try to make them feel better so I can then make myself feel better.

But I cant connect to people. I only have one person who I see as a friend, and I'm not even that close to her. 

I find it very hard to make connections with people, but over time I have gotten very good at faking connections.

Since I am very good at altering myself to fit what other people want to see-- I've actually managed to get myself into many unwanted "friendships" that I cant get out of. If someone sees me as their friend, I i feel like im obligated to be their friend. But its all an act. I can change my personality so well that I have managed to become 3 people's best friend. Three people see me as their best friend, while I see them only as acquaintances.

Hanging out with these people exhaust me, because I am acting the entire time, its exhausting. (Plus I just really don't want to see them). I have a different persona for every person I hang around, including my own family.

I want to form connections, thats literally all I want in life, and maybe thats why I keep trying to make friends. But I cant help but to unintentionally create a persona of what they want in a friend.
