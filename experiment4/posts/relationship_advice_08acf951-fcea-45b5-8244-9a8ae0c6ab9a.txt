Ex-bf owes me a lot of $
Basically the title. Ex owes me a lot of $ ($35,000). He and his entire family has blocked me. what do I do? Ive spoken with an attorney. I’ve consulted with her before. I haven’t retained her, part of me thinks he wants me to get one so I pay an attorney $. Any advice would be great. Thanks in advance.

Edit: he owes me $35k. Some written. The rest through text with a repayment plan. I’ve sent all of that to an attorney. We didn’t cohabitate, don’t have a child together (thank God), and this isn’t a revenge thing. If it was revenge I’d go after more. This was an agreed upon amount. Hopefully that isn’t as vague. I just didn’t want to go into too many details as I don’t know if he or his family are on here. I don’t want to ruin his life, I just want my $ back and never think of him again.

EDIT: u/FrameworkInProgress is not my ex. I have no idea what he’s talking about with all his comments. Also, I took out the part of my speculation on if he’s back with his ex or not. That’s not really relevant. Thanks for everyone’s advice.
