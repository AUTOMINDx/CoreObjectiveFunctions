You might not even notice the moment when you go from just surviving to wanting things again
I just wanted to say Happy Holidays to all of you.

Very mild trigger warning here for first responders.

I am a physician in NYC.

I can't believe it has been almost two years since March 2020, when my life changed forever.

It's been almost three months since I finished my residency, and took some time off to try to improve my mental health.

I'd avoided celebrating anything for so long. I just...I couldn't do it. I felt so guilty. I just thought about all the people I lost to Covid, and I couldn't think of any reason why I should be happy ever again.

I kept trying to live because I had other people to live for. Suicide felt selfish, even. I would keep going because I couldn't put my loved ones and colleagues through yet another loss.

After almost 18 months of living like I was with my dead patients and colleagues, in spite of expecting the short, dark days of the holidays would be particularly difficult...I've found, strangely, that most days have been worth being awake.  Even therapy is getting easier.

Today I went out and I bought this little crappy Charlie Brown Christmas tree and I found the ten ornaments my mom sent me when I first moved to NYC and the lights I used at my wedding and I just...did my best. When I was done with a truly hilarious amount of sweating and swearing, I showed my husband and the cats this garish monstrosity and he just...he looked both baffled and just so, so relieved. That I was doing this, just because...I wanted to. I wanted something again.

The arc of the universe does not bend toward goodness or balance or mental health, but there are good days ahead along with the bad. There are people who care about you, and reasons to keep trying. Merry Christmas.

"Ring the bells that still can ring,

Forget your perfect offering.

There is a crack in everything

That's how the light gets in."
