how can i manage to have a career with my past in adult entertainment?
I’m honestly conflicted about what to do next with my career? i love doing adult entertainment. and i wouldn’t mind pursuing it further but i know i need to have a full time job with benefits 

I’ve been an adult entertainer for the last year on Onlyfans

i started making Tik Tok videos and i gained 97,000 followers on tik tok in 6 months. i decided to do onlyfans since i really needed money with covid and people wanted it

i make around 50k before taxes and it’s been a relatively stable source of income. 

i have a degree in Media Communications. and want to find a job doing social media for company

im scared cause most employers won’t be okay with onlyfans in my past.

but I think my tik tok/onlyfans career shows i have skills in marketing and social media. and it’s kind of weird to not be able to show that to a company. i’ve been featured on buzzfeed before

should i put my tik tok career on my resume? are there companies that would be okay with that in my past?

without my tik tok career my resume feels underwhelming.

maybe it would be best to stop doing adult entertainment all together and see what i can find with my resume as is

in the best case scenario i’d be able to find a job and keep doing onlyfans and have two sources of income.

what do you think i should do? what would
be the best way to deal with my onlyfans? did i basically ruin my career by doing it?
