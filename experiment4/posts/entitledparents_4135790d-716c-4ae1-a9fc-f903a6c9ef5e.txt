Entitled aunt and uncle demand childcare
This story happened quite a while ago, back when I was a newborn. My entitled uncle, who we'll call ED, and my entitled aunt, who we'll call Karen (which is her actual name), also had a kid who was the same age as me. 

ED and Karen both had jobs, while my mom was a stay-at-home mom, and I was her only child at the time. They asked if my mom would be able to take care of their kid while Karen was at work. They even offered somewhat reasonable payment. 

This arrangement went on for close to a year with no issues, until my mom got pregnant again. The pregnancy had started to drain her energy, and she was tired more often. Karen was beginning to get unhappy that she had to start taking days off of work for when my mom was unable to watch her kid.

Eventually, this reached a tipping point. My mom started experiencing intense back pain, and the doctor thought she may have meningitis. 

Obviously, she had to tell ED and Karen she was simply unable to care for their son anymore. They would not accept this for an answer. They said "we're paying you, so we demand that you watch over our son!"

They didn't even attempt to sound sympathetic to my mom's condition, and thought of her as merely a servant, instead of their family member. Thankfully, we don't keep in touch with them anymore.
