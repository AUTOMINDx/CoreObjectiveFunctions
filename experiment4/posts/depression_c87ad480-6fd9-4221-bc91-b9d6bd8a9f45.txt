I wouldn’t wish being poor on a single soul
I’ve been searching for a job in this “labor shortage” for months, went back to school and got certifications to do everything the “right” way and been going to the psychiatrist and therapist regularly. cant get a job because I’m a medical marijuana patient and black and everyone looks at me like a junkie for smoking some pot so I don’t off myself. It’s a miserable experience, the psychiatrist can give you pills to numb out the feelings but having thousands of dollars in bills makes me understand why people kill themselves for financial reasons.
