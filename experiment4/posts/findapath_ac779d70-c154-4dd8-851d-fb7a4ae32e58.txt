Recently graduated 26, University in the Bay area with a degree in cognitive science and a specialization in user interaction, its accounted to nothing so far.
Currently I'm living in a pretty bad situation and it's making me unhappy. I worked very hard for my degree but when it came time to find a job it's been near impossible because I don't have a network in place. To pass the time I've been volunteering at the local hospital to keep my head right as I'm dealing with major depression and a lack of close connections. Needless to say I've been looking at different paths like going for a nursing degree or a master's on data science. I'm burnt out, I left my job in food service but regret it because it gave me structure even though it was pretty abusive, low pay, and an unhappy work environment. Been applying around but it seems like everyone that I've ran into have always gotten the job from knowing someone. Should I pursue a trade like arborist? go for a master's degree? pursue certain certifications related to data analysis?
