(25M) Escaping tonight, please help
Hey everyone. Tonight is the moment. I am taking a train and leaving them behind. I decided to book a few nights at a hostel in the city I'm going to. Here is the problem: Once they realize I'm gone, My parents are definitely going to call the police and tell them that I'm mentally unstable and that they're afraid I'm going to commit suicide. They will do everything in their power to not let me escape. I'm afraid the police will then show up at the hostel and the hostel staff would kick me out, following an arrest and hospitalization. Don't ask why or how, I live in Croatia and our system here is MEGA fucked up. If that happens, there might be a chance of me falling under a conservatorship since my mother has evidence and papers from the psychiatrist I went to who diagnosed me with multiple, serious mental disorders. I was also admitted to a psychiatric hospital two years ago. I am trying not to be afraid but I'm sitting on my bed and shaking, trying to tell myself I'll get through it.

UPDATE: I've done it. Thank you everyone for kind words of encouragement. Forever grateful âš”ðŸ’œ
