I love all of you
You all made me feel better. And i should make you feel better!! It is not stupid, even if it is stupid, doesn't matter. I am not supposed to act as super ultra non-mistake smart man and put the boundaries between other people. I were selfish, but not anymore. I am here to thank you and support you. To overcome selfishness, i should think other people.

Putting boundaries with people kills me every day. I thought i can overcome being alone for years. But no, i am always in depression. Because human is a social matter. And i've created so many fake scenario inside me for just getting attention and admiration. 

Knowing being not alone feels good. Thank you all and i hope you will solve all of your problems! I wish you a beautiful life!!
