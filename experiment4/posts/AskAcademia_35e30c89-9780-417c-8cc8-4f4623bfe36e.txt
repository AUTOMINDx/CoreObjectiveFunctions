Search Committees: What Do You Want to See After a Successful Second Round?
I had a second round full-day interview with a private liberal arts college and thought it went great. I felt connected to everyone I met and interviewed with and even though it was 9 hours of virtual meetings, I ended the day feeling very energized and optimistic. Based on advice from others, I sent a personalized thank you to each person I met the next morning, but now I'm second-guessing those emails. The replies I received have been encouraging, but I feel like I may have leaned too heavily into my emotional investment and overshared my enthusiasm.

For those of you on hiring committees, do you expect any sort of follow-up from short-listed candidates after their full-day interviews? If so, what do you want/hope to see?

As an aside: Is it really for entire committees and departments to put a smile on and keep candidates encouraged throughout the process? I seriously did not expect so much positive engagement throughout the day, but since I don't have a ton of second-round interview experience, maybe that's the norm?

First post here. Thanks in advance for any advice.
