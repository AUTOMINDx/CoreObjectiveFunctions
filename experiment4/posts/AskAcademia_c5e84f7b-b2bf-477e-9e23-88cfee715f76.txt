How can I, a computer science student, learn more about mathematics without grad school or doing another bachelors?
I want to delve deeper into math, in particular into statistics, probability, optimization and operation's research, or in other words applied math.

I don't really have the time to go and get another bachelor's, nobody in their right mind is going to allow me to get a master's in math or PhD with CS mathematics.

So, what could I realistically do in this scenario? I don't want to self-learn, I just can't do it with math, and I want to take whatever I learn in math into real life, particularly into building a business.

I don't know what to do, but I definitely do not want to let go of learning math. It's just something I have to do, and I can't just move on from it.

Also, not that this is all that relevant, but this would be happening in a Canadian context. I figure that might make things different than the US.
