Part-Time Remote IT Careers?
I am an aspiring digital artist. My passion is illustration and drawing. However, drawing and illustration does not require a degree - I can likely learn from online classes rather than attend college for it. Therefore, I only need enough money to pay the bills, and have enough time to pursue art.

Does anyone know of any InfoTech jobs that I can work part-time in and remotely, while having enough time remaining to pursue illustration? 

I have looked into software development, however I do not need to make that much money (med salary is &gt;\~$100k.) $50k is all I need. I was also originally interested in becoming an actuary, but I do not think it would be a fulfilling career and allow enough time for me to pursue illustration.   
I want to heavily pursue illustration, learn more, and hone my craft. However, I need steady income, and hopefully from a job that does not make me miserable.
