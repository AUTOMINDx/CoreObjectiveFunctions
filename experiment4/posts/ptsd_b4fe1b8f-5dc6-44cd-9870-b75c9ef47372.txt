For anyone who'll listen
This time of year is tough for me. I watched my family die and there was nothing I could do to save them. I don't celebrate Christmas anymore and I've shunned off most of my friends and family. But this year, my sister invited me to have a meal with her before she and her partner left to spend the holidays with his family. He's Anishinaabe, and they gave me a dreamcatcher his aunt made. Now, it's probably only a coincidence, but in the 3 days that I've had it, I can't remember any of my nightmares. It's certainly the most thoughtful gift anyone's ever given me, and I just wanted to share this with anyone who'll listen.
