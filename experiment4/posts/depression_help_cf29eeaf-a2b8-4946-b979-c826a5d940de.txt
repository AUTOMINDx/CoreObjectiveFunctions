USERS.
i posted a rant a few days ago and this person said I could talk to them, I let it all out expecting to feel better when it made me feel worse because they didn’t care they were only interested in my body. I told them everything just to be answered with “want to swap nudes? It makes you feel better”… I feel like a dummy for believing I could trust someone with how that’s went for me the past few years. I thought we were all going through similar things in this group but I guess some are here to just use us. i feel like warning everyone that some people in this group may only be in here to manipulate us for our body’s while we’re feeling low.
