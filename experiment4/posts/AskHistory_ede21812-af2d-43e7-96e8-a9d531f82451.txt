Did Napoleon really use a French flag as a sail?
I'm watching Abel Gance's 1927 film, Napoleon. It claims to be largely based on historical accounts of Napoleon's life, but as someone who isn't very well-read on French history or Napoleon himself, it's hard for me to gauge the level of historical accuracy, or how much of the "historical record" that it references is scholarly history, and how much is either legend-making or taken from more subjective sources.

There's a phenomenal sequence that intercuts two events, allegedly happening almost simultaneously: Napoleon liberating a French flag from the war council at Ajaccio and fleeing from Corisca to France during a terrible storm using the flag as a sail, while back in France the Montagnards are taking control of the National Assembly and declaring hostilities against the Girondists.

So... did the flag thing really happen? The sequence in the movie is extremely powerful, which makes me wonder if it's just great storytelling or if it's an instance of the craft rising to the scale of the subject matter.
