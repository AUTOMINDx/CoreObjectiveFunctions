I (32F) feel my partner (32M) and I don't spend much time doing things together and really enjoying each others company.
Our weekends are filled with looking at our phones and watching whatever he wants to watch on TV. If I choose something he goes off to another room to watch YouTube videos. We both have high stress jobs and I think for him tv and videogames are his favourite outlet, particularly since Covid. 

I have a lot of interests but they're usually activities that can be done solo (drawing, sewing, bird watching). He almost never pays an interest in what I'm doing. I feel like I pay interest to the things he's doing even if I don't really enjoy them, but because he likes them I ask him questions etc. I don't tend to get that back from him.

We've had some issues in the past but nothing bad. I feel like we're drifting apart and I wonder if this is common at this stage in a relationship. We've been together 4 years. 

I guess I just want to know if this is a common complaint
