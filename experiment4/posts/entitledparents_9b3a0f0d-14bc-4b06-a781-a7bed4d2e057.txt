EM asked me to change my seat
Okay, this is an old story that I just remembered while talking to a friend about the new Spiderman movie.

I'm a big fan of the marvel movies, I've seen them all several times, this happened when Endgame came out, I bought my ticket as soon as they came out and chose a really good spot in a VIP teather because I wanted to enjoy my movie, I got off work and headed there, when I go into the room and my seat, there's 2 kids around 12-14, one of them sitting in my seat, the room was clearly full since it was the premier, I checked my ticked to confirm and walked to one of the employees telling him that there was someone on my seat, he walks with me, checks my ticket and the seat number and tells the kid he needs to sit in his designated seat since this was mine, the kid looks back at EM who gets up and tells me if I could let his kid sit there since they couldn't find seats close to each other and his was far away from them and this was a nice one, the kid's seat was in the second row LOL, I kindly told her that I knew it was hard to get tickets with good seats and that's why I bought mine weeks in advance, that I have paid for that seat and I wanted it, that I knew it was nice because I picked it, sorry for the kid but I was not getting my neck f..... Up because of them, she got pretty upset and told me I was alone and older and could move, I told her she was older than me so she could go sit there and let the kid take her seat, the employee asked me if I wanted to change my seat, I said hell no, so he told the kid if he didn't move they would have to call security, the kid did, EM sat in the second row and let the kid take hers, not without killing me with her eyes.

SPOILER ALERT ⚠️

I enjoyed my movie laying down in a nice seat and cried my eyes out when Iron man died lol but yeah what is wrong with some parents and thinking because they decided to have kids they are entitled to others things
