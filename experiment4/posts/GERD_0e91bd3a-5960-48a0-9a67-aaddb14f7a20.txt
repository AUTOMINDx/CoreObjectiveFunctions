Will I ever have my life back from reflux?
This illness has completely eaten alive my life. I feel ever tired and distracted because I can't sleep at night due to acid reflux caused sleep apnea. I have to manage every moment of my day with reflux and I can't barely enjoy the little things. This is as well influencing really bad my college career. I planned to get fundoplication done in the first months of this new year, but at this point I'm not sure anymore I will get back my life together. Excuse me for this rant but I'm so exhausted. Thank you if you've made it this far. Have a nice Xmas holidays you guysðŸ’ž.
