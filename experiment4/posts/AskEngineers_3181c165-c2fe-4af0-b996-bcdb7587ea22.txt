How to get over the feeling of being replaceable as an engineer? This seems like an issue affecting a lot of my peers.
Management tries to set up our roles so that people are as replaceable as possible and it kind of bugs me, even though I totally understand. I know it is not just me because some of my peers are so insecure that they don't make a real effort to teach newcomers basic job functions properly, act agitated when someone is still learning, and refuse to mentor.
