How do you know it’s time to search for a new job?
I have by many standards a great job for my age (24). I work for a Fortune 500 company making ~90k in a highly transferable skill. The company does a solid job of promoting from within and providing additional opportunities for growth/training.

The catch is that I’m working 60-75 hours per week and often finding myself working over vacation time. Its gotten to a point where my work hours are taking a toll on my personal life, and to a degree, my health. 

I tell myself that it’d be stupid to leave such a good job, but I’m exhausted from trying to manage a difficult work/life balance. The thought of searching for other jobs has crossed my mind, but I’m not sure it’s the wisest decision. Any advice on how to proceed or manage work/life balance is appreciated. 




TLDR: my job has great upward mobility and pay but my work-life balance is miserable. Looking for advice on how to make the most of the situation.
