My roommate doesn't talk to me and i don't know why
There is no beef between us. I don't know why he avoids talking to me. All my other roommates are completely fine with me and will talk to me just fine, but that one roommate really keeps all his responses as short as possible, making it hard to start a convo and when i say good morning he just hums to not be silent. I'm not mean to him nor did i do anything bad to him (to my knowledge), and it's even weirder because he seems quite outgoing and he talks normally to my other roommates but for whatever reason, he talks as least as possible with me. As if he was offended by something about me.

Does anyone know what could be the problem and how could i fix it? Did anyone experience this aswell or is it just me? We are roommates for only 3 and 1/2 months so we don't know each other very well
