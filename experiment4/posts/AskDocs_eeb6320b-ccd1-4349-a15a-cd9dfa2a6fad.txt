Tested Positive for Cocaine, but I've never done Coke or any derivatives of it
29M, 6'3 210lbs, no relevant location/duration of complaint, straight edge lifestyle, not on any meds.

So I took an oral drug test for work, and the test results came back saying that I was positive for cocaine. The trouble is that I've never done coke or any derivatives of it. I asked about retesting the sample, and the testing company told me I need to pay $150 in order to retest. 

So my question is: What do I do? I need to fight this result but I don't know how. Should I just fork over the $150 to get it retested or is there something else I can do? Also are oral drug tests known to show a false positive result? And if I can't get rid of this result, is it going to make future employment opportunities difficult?

If anyone here has any advice I'd really appreciate it.

Other Info:
I don't do any drugs, the only time I ever have was when I would occasionally smoke weed in college 10 years ago, but I haven't smoked in years, and I haven't ever tried anything else either. I'm also not on any medications and have not been to a doctor or dentist in years. I also don't live with people who do drugs either. Also I'm in California, if location matters.
