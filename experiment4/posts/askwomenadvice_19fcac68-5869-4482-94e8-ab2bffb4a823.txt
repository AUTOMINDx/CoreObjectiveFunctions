I (24,F) am absolutely terrified to get a pap smear due to insecurities of being plus sized..
So, I am posting anonymous for obvious reasons. Please be kind.. 

I’m absolutely terrified to get a pap smear. 
I struggle a lot with self image as it is, but my biggest insecurity is my vagina.. It always has been, but especially right now. 

I have PCOS so I naturally have more weight in my stomach area, but I have gained SO much weight the past year.. (+80lbs) and I am so incredibly ashamed and embarrassed. My hormones have been really all over the place affecting my periods and my skin, everything. I know I need this exam but I’m so scared my doctor will think I’m disgusting or something and be an inconvenience to her day. She is also plus sized which somewhat eases my nerves but I’m still terrified.

I have an incredibly fat mons pubis (the top part of my vagina) and labia. This is due to being obese but also because I have PCOS. I also am very pale but it is quite dark and discoloured down there and I just think I look so weird. I find myself extremely disgusting and I am so scared, I’m about to cancel my appointment for a second time, it makes me so heartbroken and ashamed to even feel this way.. 

I’m on a strict diet right now and working out to better my health and lose this weight, so I keep telling myself I can just wait until I lose the weight and maybe I will be a bit less insecure. 

Plus sized ladies, or anyone for that matter, do you have any advice? How can I force myself to go? Or should I just wait until I lose the weight that I want and then get the exam?
