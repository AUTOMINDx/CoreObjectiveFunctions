Are there any phones without virtual assistants?
So, I read the rules and I'm not asking what phone should I buy, but I'm asking is there any phone without a virtual assistant? Or one where you can fully delete it from the phone? I'm not saying deactivate it, but straight up delete it.

I have a samsung and bixby is terrible, yet I can't get rid of it. It also has a button for that thing and every time I try to take a screenshot, bixby opens up, even tho I deactivated it. It's super annoying and I just want to know if there is any kind of smartphone without any assistant
