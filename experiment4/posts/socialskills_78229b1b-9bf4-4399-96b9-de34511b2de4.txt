Truth be told: You probably have ego problems.
Yep, even you.

A common misconception is that having a big ego is reserved for people who think highly of themselves. Sure, they have big egos, but believe it or not, your self-loathing-ass probably does too.

The concept I'm trying to convey here is when you fill your own head with thoughts of yourself constantly, be them negative or positive, it all constitutes a big ego. Over time, you create this self-image that you become tied to, and thus, it becomes fragile. And, due to this big fragile ego, you refuse to take the actions necessary to get outcomes you desire, because your head is so over-inflated with thoughts of yourself that you aren't giving your thought space the necessary room to interact with and understand the rest of the world. Your subconscious is terrified of anything that can challenge this fragile ego, and so you freak out at the thought of stepping outside your comfort zone and putting yourself out there.

Couple points:

- You're not that important. The only person thinking so much about you is YOU. And the more you think about yourself and how you suck at social skills, are ugly, are afraid of rejection, are this/that, the less you can think about the people around you who you actually WANT to interact with. (disclaimer: because I know some pedant in the comments is gonna bring this up: this isn't targeting those who genuinely DON'T want to interact with others. But seriously, why are y'all on /r/socialskills if your goal isn't to interact with others?)

- When you switch your perspective to learning about and understanding the people and world around you - even in ways that it doesn't affect you - you'll see a profound change in the way you exist. Sure, you'll get rejected. But you'll realize that *it doesn't fucking matter.* You're not so important that this rejection is the end of some great value you brought to the table. 

- Approach the world seeking to learn from it and contribute to it. If you have nothing to contribute, learn. If you have nothing to learn, contribute. If you have both, do both.

**TLDR:** The long and short of it is that the more you think about yourself, whether it's good or bad thoughts, the less you're thinking about others and the world around you. I hope this helps some people get over social hurdles that they constructed themselves.

*edit:* Wanted to add a section about actually changing these things. Whenever I feel like something is "easier said than done," or "hard bc I've been this way all along," I call upon a very simple concept: discipline. As I stated in a comment, discipline is doing something that sucks, but you know is good for you, even when you don't want to. And "not having discipline" is a cop-out, since it literally is just doing things when you don't want to. There is no great chasm between zero and one. Do or do not, there is no try. You'll never get it if you don't start it, and you'll never have it if you don't keep at it. So discipline yourself to stop your spiraling negative thought processes - meditate, learn to harness your mind and stop letting negative thoughts fill your head. Discipline yourself to go to the gym even when you're tired as shit. Discipline yourself to go and talk to the person you're nervous to talk to, even when you don't want to. Just do it. There's no rocket science here, it's just a matter of doing until it becomes habit. Good luck!
