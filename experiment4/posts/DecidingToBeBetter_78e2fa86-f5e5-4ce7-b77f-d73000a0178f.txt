I (21F) think I may be a narcissist
For the longest time, I thought the world was against me in everything. My parents were emotionally abusive. I had very few friends and was bullied in school. When I was fourteen, I developed suicidal thoughts after a bad bullying incident. My parents told me that suicide is for the weak, so I decided to tell myself some affirmations to make myself feel better. But it wasn't things such as "you're loved" or "you're smart". No. I still have some of the letters. It would be things like "I deserve the world, but the world doesn't deserve me". 

My mother has said several times that I always make things about myself. In high school, friends would get annoyed because I would always redirect the conversation to be about myself. I also have a tendency to victimize myself. 

There was one time when a guy (accidentally) led me on, only for him to have a girlfriend the whole time. I wanted him to break up with her. I didn't care if he broke her heart. I only cared that I was good enough for him to pursue. I've never had a guy like me before, ever. I was always told by friends and family that I'll never be pretty enough. 

I know it's not right, and on one hand I'm disgusted, but on the other hand, I'm not. Am I a narcissist? I want to know so I can be better
