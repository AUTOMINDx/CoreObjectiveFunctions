How do I enjoy the holidays when I take on most of the mental and physical load?
My (f30) husband (m29) is a nice person and I don't think he's trying to be hurtful, but I'm at the point where I no longer enjoy the holidays because I'm taking on the full load of everything. On top of my full time job, I'm doing most of the house work and now I'm buying and wrapping presents, putting out 90% of the holiday decorations including outside lights, preparing and hosting the xmas eve party and as usual planning everything. This year I made a calendar and sent it to all my family members including him so I don't have to answer 100 questions and he hasn't bothered to look at it which is hurtful considering all the work I put into it. Both of his parents are driving me crazy saying they weren't invited to anything because he never sent the calendar. He tells me all the time if you want help just ask but I don't feel like I should have to point out everything that needs to be done all the time and when I do ask he does things with an attitude and it makes me feel like crap. To top this whole situation off I work from home and he has the entire month of December off ( extra pto) so every day I hear him sitting in his office playing video games or watching a movie. I just want him to take initiative without me asking or him being so overwhelmed that he has a terrible attitude. Has anyone else dealt with this? If so how do I navigate the holidays better? What can I tell my husband that won't overwhelmed him? 

Tldr: I'm completely overwhelmed and can't seem to get husband to understand that I need help without him getting upset.

Update: Just as I expected he freaked out when I showed him the list even after he said he would help. It escalated to the point where he asked for a divorce. Sounds like that is the direction I'm going in.
