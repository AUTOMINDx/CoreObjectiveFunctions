Progressive disease patients should be compensated greatly for dismissive or ignorant doctors who waste time and delay crucial treatment.
The fact that you could end up unable to walk for the rest of your life because of a doctor who dismisses most of your symptoms, forcing you to wait until it's too late, is one of the most horrible injustices I've ever heard of. Very real damage can accrue during all of the time spent waiting to be seen. Making someone wait for even longer by refusing to dig deeper feels downright evil.
