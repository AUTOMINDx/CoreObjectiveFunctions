9 years ago, I donated a part of my liver to our baby daughter. Any transplant hepatologists or pathologists on here? Liver biopsy/immunosuppression questions inside.

Nine years ago, I donated a part of my liver to our baby daughter. Since  then, as is the norm for all transplant recipients, she is permanently  walking on the razor's edge of finding the right level of  immunosuppression: one that sufficiently prevents rejection, but yet  minimizes the toxic side effects on the rest of her growing body. We are  now faced with a chance to lower her immunosuppression somewhat, but  worry about messing up her organ after what has been a relatively stable  stretch. We have a biopsy coming up in about a month, so I am wondering  whether the biopsy would definitively tell us whether the lower  immunosuppression is still sufficient. If it turns out that lowering was  a mistake, will the biopsy show that in as little as a month? Or does  it take longer for the inflammation to show up on the biopsy? Is there  even such thing as a graft that is entirely free from  inflammation/fibrosis 9 years in, or is some degree inflammation always  expected for a transplanted organ? Can the biopsy indicate whether the  inflammation is the result of inadequate immunosuppression or drug  toxicity?

Many thanks in advance!
