Was diagnosed with GERD and a stage 4 Hernia. Anyone else here suffer from upper back and rib cage pain?
I just want to know it this is what’s causing my symptoms. For a whole year I thought it was my back that was causing my symptoms, die a lot of tests and physical therapy, nothing helped. 

After a trip to the ER earlier this year I got diagnosed with a hernia, reflux and Gastritis but the doctors made it seem like everyone has it and that I should avoid stress (they didn’t take me serious at all). 

After my ER trip I connected the dots and went to a private doctor who finally took me seriously and with the help of the endoscopy discovered how serious my Hernia and Reflux are. I‘m getting the operation done in February and honestly can’t wait. This has taken so much quality of life away from me. 

I‘m experiencing a flare up right now, it feels like I am full very quickly, and my whole upper just hurts and burns. Anyone experience this? Some movements it hurts so much my whole upper body cramps and I can’t move for a second. Only thing that helps is laying in bed (or more sitting) with a heating blanket for my back and a hot bottle for my tummy. 

I want my life back, I really hope the operation is gonna safe me..
