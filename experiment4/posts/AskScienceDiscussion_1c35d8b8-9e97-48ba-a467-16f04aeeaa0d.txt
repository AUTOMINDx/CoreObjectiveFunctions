When sending a signal through an object, does an electron actual flow through it?
Do example, the other day I placed one hand on a microcontroller data pin and my other hand on an led strip. The signal went through me and the light show worked perfectly, although I did need to hold tight.
What exactly is happening? Are electrons flowing through me? How does an electron know how to travel through my body and where to exit? I'm not a simple wire with two ends.
