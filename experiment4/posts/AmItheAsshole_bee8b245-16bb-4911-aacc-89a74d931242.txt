AITA I didn't go to see my ex at the hospital
I and my ex divorced 5 months ago because she came out as lesbian. I didn't want the baby when she came out to me because I felt it would be awkward for us to coparent and I didn't want any contact with her. However, she wanted to keep the baby so I accepted her decision and didn't talk about it anymore. 

A few weeks ago, the baby was premature by nearly 2 months and turned out to be still born. I was in a business meeting so I texted her saying I was sorry for her loss and had flowers sent to her. Her gf and family have been calling and texting me since them saying that I'm a heartless jerk for not going to meet her at the hospital after such a traumatic experience. 

My ex called me and said that I must be really happy that I got what I originally wanted. 

To be honest, although I feel sorry for her loss, I am relieved that we don't have to stay in contact with each other anymore and I can move on from her. 

AITA?

Edit: 
I had originally wanted the child but when I found out that she cheated on me, I didn't look forward to coparenting with her. I felt it would be better for the baby to be aborted rather than to suffer from our bad relationship. 

That doesn't mean I would've hated the baby upon it's birth. I'd have loved it regardless. Just that it would be difficult to coparent with a person who's bad at communication. 

In short, I didn't not want the baby. I just didn't want a baby with a person who might not be a good coparent. I do love babies. I always wanted a baby with the person I love. 

To all those saying that I'm relieved about a baby's death.....I'm NOT relieved that the baby died, I'm relieved that I no longer will be forced to be cordial with my ex.
