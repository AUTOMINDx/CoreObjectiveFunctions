AITA for refusing to fire my personal trainer per his wife's request?
Throwaway bc I don't want this on my main.

I (43F) hired my trainer Alex (fake name) in mid 2018 through the gym. I asked for someone who understands chronic pain because I've had it for 20 years and need help managing it. Swimming did wonders until my body began to develop negative reactions to pool chemicals which was why I switched to the gym.

Long story short, Alex helped beyond expectation. He helped me improve so much, a few months ago my doctor actually switched me to milder pain medication, and lowered the doses too. So as a token of appreciation I gave Alex an early Christmas card last week with a $50 gift card. The message was a simple: "Thank you for your help. Best wishes."

Today I went for solo training and a woman approached me claiming to be Alex's wife. She accused me of getting friendly with Alex and demanded that I ask the gym to switch trainers. I refused and she got aggressive, so I got the staff involved and they removed her.

Later I told friends about the incident, they say I was disrespectful and should have honored her wishes. Though I don't think Alex's wife's insecurity is my problem, I feel bad about possibly getting him into trouble at home. AITA?

ETA: Many of you mentioned the possibility of a stalker imposter and now I'm getting chills. Never even thought of that! I'll give the gym a call first because if it's a stalker imposter then she might harass other people too. Since I don't have Alex's private number I'll ask the gym to give him a heads up. Then I'll talk to him when I see him next week!
