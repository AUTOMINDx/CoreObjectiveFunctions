Is it weird that depression feels good???
I have already fucked up my entire life so nothing really matters anymore. Why should I even try anymore. It feels kinda relaxing, idk if that’s a good thing. But i’m not happy either. I hate myself more than anything but I just don’t care about anything anymore. I feel so warm and relaxed, it almost feels like i’m high or something but i’m not. I’m a bit worried tho, I don’t think this is a good thing at all and i’m scared that I would kms in the near future.
