Bored of life! What can I do?
I am extremely bored with my life right now. I go to school and I come home and do nothing. I am on my phone or video game almost all day and I have no motivation to do any school work because I am so bored and kind of burnt out. I am bored of sitting on my couch or in my gaming room all day. I have no idea what normal people do everyday to have a fulfilling life. I don't have anything particular I want to do. I need to bring motivation, inspiration, and excitement into my life. 
Help!!
**** forgot to add that I am 22 and I do have a job! I am also starting a new job next week.
