Have not received a performance based raise in over 6 years. Should I consider new opportunities?
Every year I receive the same cost of living increase(3.25%) and a variable bonus based on the company’s performance. 

While these wage increases are helpful I know I’m falling behind my industry peers when it comes to salary. I’ve performed internet research and with my education and experience I’m being paid 20% below market value(location factored in).

I asked for a raise a year ago by justifying the increased complexity of my position while presenting real metrics on how I’ve improved efficiencies, saved time, reduced operating costs, and helped other coworkers. I also presented my salary research for justification for the raise. 

My manager reviewed all the materials and stated that I was being payed fairly for my position and work. He said “You don’t just receive a raise because your doing your job” Obviously I was frustrated with his assessment… he’s a hands off manager and doesn’t get into the details of my work/position.

I like the company I work for but the raise rejection got me thinking about looking for a new job. Is 6 years too long in a position to not receive a performance increase? What’s considered normal? Am I waisting my time trying to justify for another raise or just move on?
