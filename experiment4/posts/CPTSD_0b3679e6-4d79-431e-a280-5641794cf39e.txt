Screw toxic positivity. I’m sick of it. It feels like a major hurdle in recovery.
Not looking for advice, this is a vent. Happy to hear any ways you all have pushed back against toxic positivity though.

I went out with my foraging group today and one of the group organizers keeps asking me if I have found a job. When I am really struggling with my job search and she knows this. I was feeling good today and was able to sleep last night. But then… she asks.. I feel good so I break my boundary and I am just authentic. I say uh I got a job then before I can even finish, she interrupts me to say oh yay that’s so awesome when do you start? What do you do?… i then continued to say well the hiring manager texted me before I could sign the papers to say they changed their mind… and nothing but more prying questions and a lot of 
“Well it’s just a redirection!” “Did you even want it anyway?” I said no and she said, well then this is good news. And it’s like … well no I didn’t want it… I literally need a job to survive right now I can’t afford rent… so no can we let the situation just be justifiably not okay? So I can feel sane and okay in my mental state? Ugh.

I don’t know why in all that i revealed that my pet also died on that day… nothing just no response… what the hell. Pry about my life, get me to talk about hard shit then say nothing. Piss off. I’m mad at myself I could have saved myself if I just said “I don’t want to talk about that right now.” But I was just wanting to be open… idk.. I am tired of pretending to be okay. Pretending to be happy when the reality is i am barely surviving. I have to pretend to be okay so others can be comfortable? Just seems fucked.
