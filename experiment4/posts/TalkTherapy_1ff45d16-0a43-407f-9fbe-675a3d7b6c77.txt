my therapist said something intense that was really touching
i had a challenging and much needed appointment today. i am struggling overall right now, and experiencing suicidal thoughts at times. i was telling my therapist about a list i made last week of 15 reasons not to make a suicide attempt and one of them was the statement “if suicide is contagious then survival is contagious too.” she really liked this, and asked me where i had learned that. i don’t remember, but it’s something i’ve been thinking about a lot over the last year. i feel a deep sense of interconnectedness and desire to build healthy communities. maybe that sounds stupid, but it helps me a lot. so we are digging into this idea and at one point my therapist said “i would be devastated if you killed yourself.” i’ve been seeing her for almost five years and i could tell from her voice and face that she was very sincere, not that she’s ever insincere. i was certainly not fishing for this and it’s not something i’ve ever considered (in either a positive or negative way) but it’s was very intense and very touching to hear. the therapeutic relationship is such a unique one, defined by boundaries and ethics to keep me safe as a client, but no less human than any other relationship.

i don’t know. i feel like i can’t tell anyone in person about this exchange so i thought i’d share here.
