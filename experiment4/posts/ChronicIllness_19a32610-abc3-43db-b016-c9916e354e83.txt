I’m sick of being sick
I have undiagnosed GI issues, and it’s destroying my life. 
I’ve kept a food journal but as soon as I think I find a trigger food and cut it out, something else that’s never bothered me before pops up. 
What I mean is, I found that 2 of the worst ones were certain dairy(not lactose intolerant though) heavy foods and in-n-out. I cut out both. Now, I still have the same symptoms BUT the only food I ate in the last 24 hours was chicken broth and a piece of toast. 2 of the safest(for me) foods. It’s happened on 72 hour fasts, it’s happened with every goddamn food. Am I just not allowed to eat?!

Every test, every doctor, completely useless. My insurance won’t let me switch doctors without paying out of pocket but he said there’s nothing wrong and it’s just food poisoning. So I get food poisoning every few days? No. 

I’m sick of waking up at 3-5 AM with severe pain, I’m sick of sitting on a toilet in a cold sweat while nothing happens for 20+ minutes, I’m sick of feeling like I’m going to vomit but NEVER vomiting, I’m sick of needing to stay near a “home bowl” because no medication works to keep things solid or predictable. I can’t work, I can’t sleep, I can’t do anything. 

I don’t think a diagnosis would help at this point- every doctor I’ve gone to in my entire life has said that there’s nothing that could be done. They’ve already tried giving all of the meds and most treatments, nothing makes a difference. So what’s the point of knowing what it is when there’s nothing I can do about it 😩
