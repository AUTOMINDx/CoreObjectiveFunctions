Girlfriend wants to message my mom
So to keep it super simple if more details are needed lmk 

I have a shitty ass mom (raised by father for 18 years she never paid child support was in and out of my life with empty promises always got my hopes up just to crush them ) I was living with her at the time (moved away from home hoping to reconnect and actually have a relationship with a mother) I slowly started to notice she had a drinking problem 

Well when my gf and I got pregnant I wanted to tell her when I did she was already viciously drunk and then began to berate me calling me names standing up in an aggressive manner well I didn’t really entertain it and was quick to shield my gf (not that she can’t defend herself) before my “mother” could direct her dunken words towards her but a last I was too late and the minute she swore I her I told my girlfriend to pack her belongings and we left 

Well fast forward I have the most amazing gorgeous loving daughter anyone could ever ask for and I cannot help but feel so so guilty at the fact that I feel almost as though I’m keeping her from her 

And while I am okay with living with that feeling when I communicated with my gf about my internal conflict she urged me to reach out to the “egg donor” and resolve our differences) 

I’m just in a thought spot where I want my daughter to have a relationship with her family but I also want her to never feel the pain I felt all those years from my “mother”
