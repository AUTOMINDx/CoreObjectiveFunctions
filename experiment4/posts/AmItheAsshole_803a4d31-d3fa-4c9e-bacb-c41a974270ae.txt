AITA for not changing my daughters birthday to be not ‘vegan’?
I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THIS TO BE SHARED OR COPIED ANYWHERE IN ANY FORM

**Last edit - This has gotten way more attention than I thought it would. Most people have been kind, thank you. Some people have given me a well needed talking to about looking at how I'm living my life, thank you for that too. I can't respond to everyone, but I am doing my best to catch up with reading all of the comments now. I have seen that some people are still weirded out by soup being a main dish and not a side. Soup was chosen because it can feed a large amount of people for not a lot of cash. Money is tight, as I'm sure it is for so many other people right now. If you have a low cost alternative suggestion, please let me know! Thanks for all the judgements**


So first a little background. I found out at a very young age (~3 months) that my youngest is allergic to dairy and eggs. After a bunch of testing it was determined that she can’t have dairy or eggs in any form, not even cooked/baked. On to the issue.

Her first birthday is next weekend. From the get go I wanted her birthday to be completely safe for her. As in, all food, drink, desserts, etc will be egg and dairy free. We have spent so much time figuring out what she was allergic to and avoiding it, I wanted to have one day where we do not have to monitor everything she ate. And of course being a baby, she tends to grab for anything she wants, so having no allergens at all means I don’t have to worry if one of our other children (6f, 3m) leaves their food in her reach.

This is becoming a problem now because my husband doesn’t want to have ‘only vegan food’ because he says him and his side of the family won’t eat it. I wasn’t planning on anything too out there. My mom volunteered to make her homemade veggie soup, and I was going to make a chocolate cake and frosting. The only difference between normal cake and frosting and the one I’m making is apple sauce instead of eggs and oat milk instead of cows milk.

My nephews on my husbands side won’t eat the soup at all I guess, and neither will their parents. The boys I think would have liked the cake, but as soon as my in-laws discovered it was ‘vegan’ they said they won’t eat vegan food, and neither will their kids.

My husband wants to just do pizza and ‘normal’ cake because it’s what they like. I don’t understand the point of having a birthday meal that the birthday kid can’t even eat. I didn’t think it was too much to ask to have one day that is catered to my daughter, when she’s going to have to spend the rest of her life working around everyone else. AITA?

**ETA - I have no problem making foods including meat, and have already told everyone this. I tend to just default to saying vegan instead of “egg-free and dairy-free” just because it’s faster, which is my bad. I’ve found a few options of food that do contain meat, that are still allergen free that I hope will make everyone happy.**

**One more edit - I didn’t realize that soup would be considered so weird. 😂 We live in California, but my family and I were all born and raised in Germany. Where we are from, it’s not unusual to have soup for a dinner. If you Google gemüsesuppe you’ll see what I’m talking about. At this point soup is off the table**
