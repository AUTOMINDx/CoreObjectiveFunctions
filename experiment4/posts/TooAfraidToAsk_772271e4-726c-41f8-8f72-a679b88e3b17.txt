roommate jerks off and I can hear it, how do I tell him that we can hear him?
I live in a college dorm, and I share a dorm with two other dudes. one of them jerks off pretty often and the problem is that I can hear him from my desk and he doesn’t know. I don’t care that he does it (I mean how else are dudes supposed to destress lmao) but I don’t think it would be unreasonable to let him know that the door to the bathroom definitely isn’t thick enough to block out all the noise. idk how to bring it up please help 

tldr: roommate jerks off in bathroom and I want to tell him that I can hear it but idk how to

also inb4 people say “join him”
