Does anyone else experience "The Tabr"
I don't know what else to call it, so I'm calling it "The Tabr" until hopefully someone else can come up with something better or if this term already exists, it falls into the world of mansplaining and unsolicited advice. I'm wondering if I'm alone in this, but I doubt it due to the amount of times I ran into myself.

It's the guy who for whatever reason is watching you work on your computer and he says "You know you can press Tab instead of..." it's the guy who is all about max efficiency and 100% self reliance, there is a short cut or more logical easier way for absolutely everything and they must educate you on that. Why would you do it any other way when there is a much better way for literally everything else? His purpose is to show you the way, starting with the Tab button on the keyboard.

This also ncludes knowing how to do everything the old and slow fashioned way for some reason as well... a "just in case" of some highly unlikable scenario he tries to throw at you. Example: I can say something like I don't really know how to read traditional maps well. He looks at me like I said the stupidest thing in the world and chuckles, shakes his head, and says something like "but what if the world ends and you only have a map to find your way to X" it's so bizarre how common that scenario is.

tl;dr: "The Tabr" is the man who will always have a better and smarter way of doing literally anything, modern or old fashioned way as he superiorly knows both and he acts like people who do not know of or choose to practice his same methods are doomed to die in the ending of the world because of their own self inflicted stupidity.
