Letting go of friends
I kind of noticed that I try too hard keeping friends around, but since recently I've stopped. I had a friend who confided in me about a lot of personal things and without judgment I was there for her.

But when we make plans, she is so unreliable. It's gotten to the point where I can safely assume she will cancel even if it's plans she made herself.

I had drunkenly told her that it really sucks that I only see her on her terms. She denied it.

Since then I've just not spoken to her anymore. There is just so much you can give.

I was sad for a bit, but I realised, why should I be a good friend to someone who only makes it so that she can confide in me? I don't get anything out of it. Relationships are give and take. If you think about it that way it is really a win for me.

If someone doesn't put effort in the relationship, even if they do care about you, then they're not good friends.
