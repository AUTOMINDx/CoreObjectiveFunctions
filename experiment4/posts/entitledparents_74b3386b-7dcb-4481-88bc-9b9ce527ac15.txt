my entitled grandfather wants me and my mom to spend New Years serving him
“I know how you’re going to spend New Years “myname”. You’re going to spend New Years in the kitchen.” I feel like crying. He’s been in our house for the holidays since December 10th. I’m a young girl that just wants to have fun like everyone else. While everyone else are going to be at parties having a blast on New Year’s Eve I’m going to be stuck in the kitchen serving… this is so degrading and the worst holiday season ever. I thought he would leave after Christmas I’m so sad. He kicked me out of my room. I’ve been sleeping on the couch since the 10th of December and he doesn’t care. I have to ask permission to go into my own bedroom I’m depressed while everyone else will ring in 2022 I’ll be ringing in 1922. I hate my life. This degrading kind of life is making me want to die.
