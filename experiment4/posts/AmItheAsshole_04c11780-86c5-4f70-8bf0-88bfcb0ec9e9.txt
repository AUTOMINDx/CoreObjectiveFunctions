AITA for telling a co-worker that her choice(s) of name for her twins is idiotic
I cannot believe that there is a spilt opinion for this at my office, but here we go.

A co-worker of mine (39F) recently had twin boys after a long battle with infertility. She has made her first appearance into the office with her new babies to introduce them to our team.

When asked what she had named the boys (as up until this appearance she was undecided) she told me that she was naming them "Sean". When I asked about the other baby, she said "no, they are both Sean, one with an "A" and one with an "E"  so Sean and Seen". This co-workers last name is also "Sean". When I pointed this out she said "yes, like Tom Tom or Jay Jay".

I immediately and without thinking said "that is the most idiotic thing I've heard, and it's going to be so confusing".

A bunch of people laughed and a bunch immediately looked away. After she left, I got a few text messages saying it's not my place to comment on people's choice of name.

Am I the asshole for saying that that is a terrible naming idea?

Edit. Additional information.

No, they don't have middle names, she wanted their names to be like "Tom Tom, or Jay Jay".

This is apparently not the first round of negative feedback she has had.

We are on good terms, we have worked together across three companies over 12 years, she just said "it'll grow on you".

The names both pronounced "Sean" like "Shawn".

**EDIT AND UPDATE**

My co-workers husband (who is also a co-worker) saw the post last night. They had a good chuckle and ended up agreeing with the replies that the naming process wasn't ideal, and maybe the overwhelming process of having two new borns left them too tired to think straight.

Despite the fact they had already sent off the paperwork to birth deaths and marriages office (the place you lodge births for in Australia), they called up the Brisbane office and the paperwork had only been provisionally processed (due to Xmas time), and they have used this time to reassess.

They have withdrawn the paperwork **(FOR SEEN ONLY)** and will think of a new name, but they are keeping Sean Sean as they like it.

I have also been reported to HR for making this reddit post (not by the parents, they think it's hilarious) so well well, if it's isn't the consequences of my actions.

They also want everyone to know that "calling her an idiot isn't the worst thing I've said to her this year, and while I'll definitely an AH, that's more of an in general thing than tied to this situation".

Happy holidays to everyone.
