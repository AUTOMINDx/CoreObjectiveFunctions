I stopped reaching out.
Over the last year, with all of my 'friends' I stopped reaching out to make plans or to hang out. I haven't heard from them since then, but they all continue to hang out with each other. I miss them all but its very apparent that they did not want to be my friend. So now I'm stuck in the situation of having no friends outside of work. How does one make new friends as a 28 year old man? I'm not even entirely sure that I want any friends. The pain that came from dealing with this is easily one of the most shitty feelings I have felt.
