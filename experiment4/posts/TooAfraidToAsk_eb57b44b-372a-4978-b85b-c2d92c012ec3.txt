A lot of places are short on staff. What are those former workers now doing for money?
I remember 10 years ago, getting a job at a grocery store / restaurant was super competitive.  Now I see help wanted signs everywhere.

If there is a large portion of people now refusing to do these shitty jobs, what is that portion of people doing to get money?

I have strong doubts that they all went and got graduate degrees earning big money now.

I just donâ€™t get it.
