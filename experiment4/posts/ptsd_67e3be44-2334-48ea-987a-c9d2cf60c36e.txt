how to deal with gaslighting??
There are some psycho's who ruined my life but they dont believe they didn't do anything wrong. They gaslight the entire thing as if it's my fault, that I was the crazy one and everything was somehow my fault. I just don't understand these psychopaths, how are you going to ruin someone's life and blame em on them? ptsd is making me very suicidal, I still can't believe all this happen to me. Life doesn't seem real because the experience was so surreal.
