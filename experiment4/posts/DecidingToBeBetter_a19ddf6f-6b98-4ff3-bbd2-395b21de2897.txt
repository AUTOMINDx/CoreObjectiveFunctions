Therapist gave me the worst advice ever today. But I’m proud of myself for knowing it’s wrong
For over a year I’ve been grieving the loss of my “ex” (teenage love, I think of him as a close friend) who vanished from my life the day I got together with my boyfriend. I told him the news recklessly and woke up to being blocked on everything and haven’t tried contacting him since because he set his boundaries and I will respect them. It’s been very difficult for me to process while settling into a new relationship and I’ve been entertaining the possibility of speaking to him again as a coping mechanism. It isn’t healthy, and I need to learn to move on and accept that he doesn’t wish to be part of each other’s lives anymore. 
Today my councillor, once I’ve explained it all, goes to me;




“Have you thought of writing him a handwritten letter and posting it through his letter box? Letting him know what he means to you?”





I’m sorry… what??? Looking back, this was awful advice! Not only does that halt my progress, it also disregards HIS feelings in this situation. He blocked me on everything! He doesn’t want to hear from me! The last thing I should do is walk up to his DOOR and force my way back in. I would have to be deranged to do something like that, surely?? 




Then I realised… I needed that. Not in the way she meant, but I needed to actually hear that suggestion being made to me to realise how insane it would be. I have no choice but to accept what the situation is, because even when a qualified therapist tells me to find a way to speak to him, I know that it’s wrong. 

Progress! 


Tldr; therapist told me to post a letter through my ex’s door when he has me blocked on everything. Thankfully, all I took from it was that it’s insane to break through his boundaries, and I can now begin to accept that I have no choice but to move on.
