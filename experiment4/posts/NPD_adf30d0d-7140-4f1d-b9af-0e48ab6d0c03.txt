How much of the public are narcissistic?
I have read that about 1% of population has NPD, I think this is way off, just from my family &amp; friends (I don’t have many friends) I feel pretty sure over 12 of them are narcissists. They/We are everywhere. I believe it’s more like 15-20% of the population. 
Obviously majority of narcs don’t know what they are or are willing to see a therapist. 
What are your thoughts on the the amount, do you spot them around you too.
