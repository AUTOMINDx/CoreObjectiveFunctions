Why do producers not make women's pockets bigger.
Women often mention that their pockets are unnecessarally small. Cost should not be a limiting factor to pocket size here since it would cost only a cent or two to double the size of their pockets. Given these facts, it seems like it would make sense for producers to make bigger pockets to attract more customers; however, they just don't. Why not? Is this a stated preference vs revealed preference issue?
