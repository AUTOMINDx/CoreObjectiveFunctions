Went to a local phone store and got a new phone!
Honestly my agoraphobia has not been as bad since Covid hit. For a while it made my fears rational - people, especially large crowds and the places they gather were physically dangerous - but now that I've had the vaccine and booster things are different. The mask has helped the whole time though, I'll miss it if things go back to normal. Just in general I think I needed time away from being social so the next time I go out I'm not still traumatized from the last. Plenty of people developed agoraphobia over the quarantine, but mine is honestly better.

That said my depression is out of control, it's never been so bad. It was far more a barrier than my anxiety, but I'll leave it at that. At least with anxiety I can dope myself up. Still, this is some kind of progress.

I should be more proud of this, but I'm walking a fine line. If I make a big deal out of it I know the pressure works against me. I wouldn't have posted about it but I know you guys like a success story.
