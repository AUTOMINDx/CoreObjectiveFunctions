Iâ€™m forcing myself to go out today.
Iâ€™m getting ready to leave just now. Iâ€™ll be going 20 minutes away, to the store and to look at some clothes. Iâ€™m tired of letting fear control me. 

Im scared out of my mind. Im shaking and I knew if I ate something I would get a terrible stomachache from the anxiety. But im alive. Im not in immediate danger. I will get there before I know it, and be back home before I know it. And if thereâ€™s traffic or anything like that that prolongs it, Iâ€™ll still be okay.

I want to live again.

Edit: Iâ€™m back and I survived. I started getting scared at the start and near the end but I ended up okay. The real test is tomorrow, since I have an hours long Christmas party at my relatives house. Hopefully today will help me a little bit tomorrow. But that too will be over before I know it and Iâ€™ll be able to relax and enjoy my Christmas Eve afterwards (at least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m telling myself ðŸ˜…)
