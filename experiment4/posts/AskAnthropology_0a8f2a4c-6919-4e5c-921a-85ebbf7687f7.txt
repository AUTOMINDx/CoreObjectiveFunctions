Why did so many of the large Euroasian language families originate in Siberia?
(Note that for this question when I say "Siberia" I mean the large steppelands i Northern Asia and Noertheastern Europe both East and West of the Urals, so a bit larger than what is traditionally called Siberia)

So if I've understood it correctly many of the major language families of Euroasian seem to come from the large steppe spanning the north of the continent.

As I've understood it this is where the Euroasian language family originates, as well as the ural language family, the Turkish language family, and the Mongolian one. 
While I also know that the Altaic language family isn't a thing as I've understood it the many similarities between Japanese and Korean and Turkic and Mongolic languages also suggests thhar the forebears of these languages originally coexisted in the same area.

All this has led me to the understanding that the sparsely inhabited northern steppe of Euroasia is the origin point of the languages spoken in a majority of the continent and that at several points in pre-history peoples with different language families have emerged from this area to impart their languages on large parts of Euroasia.
Why is this the case? Why could this region be so influential?
(Unless I am misinformed in which case please do correct me)
