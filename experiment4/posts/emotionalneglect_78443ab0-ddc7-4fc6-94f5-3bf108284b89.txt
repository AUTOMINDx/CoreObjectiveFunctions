"We do love you, we do xyz becuase we love you"
Can anyone relate to this particular sentence? Every time I shared my sentiment about how I felt unloved, undeserving, and hated by my family... They would spout out this. Then bring up how they fed me, took care of me, bought me things, etc. One of my siblings outright said 'a little bit of a beating is alright as long as your college tuition is paid.' 

and I feel so frustrated. They believe that all of this was done with good intentions, but why do I feel like absolute shit when I bring up my childhood to them?
