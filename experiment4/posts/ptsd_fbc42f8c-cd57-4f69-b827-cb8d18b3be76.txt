PTSD Brain is real (funny)
My husband is just SURE I'm exaggerating about PTSD affecting my concentration and memory. To put it into perspective for him, I recently listed everywhere I've tried (failingly) to use my tablet passcode as a pin/password, including...

*my phone
*HIS phone
*my computer
*credit card machines
*used as a phone number
*when asked for the last four of my social
*public callboxes
*our router's passcode
*social media account passwords

...etc. None of these have any of the same characters as my tablet's numeric passcode. 

And y'all...I just tried heating up soup in the microwave with my tablet pin number. Yep. It worked about as well as all the other places I've stuck my pin into. PTSD fries your brain.
