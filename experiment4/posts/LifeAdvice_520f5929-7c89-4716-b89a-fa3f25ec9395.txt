A friend is targeting me? She won’t leave my life alone.
I have a friend who seems to do everything that I do… but does it in a sneaky way. It feels like the emotional or mental equivalent of when kids hover their finger just next to you and won’t leave you alone because “technically” their not touching you… 

So for example I got into pottery, and I told her, she replied saying “oh so your into pottery now..” with in 2 weeks she had decided to do a lot making class…. 

I said I wanted to take my career in the direction of small business and the next time I met with her she had come up with a cafe plan with another friend….

I often say that I hiss at men when they come near me…. She has now started telling people she hissed at men on dating sites…

I’m scared to ask her to not copy me because I can’t control her, and it’s not my right to, but I feel like I don’t have controls over my life anymore because I’m always hiding from her…. What can I do?

I’m scared she will target me more out of spite. I feel very violated by her.
I just want to be free of this I don’t want to cause harm or anything. 

Is there a name for this behaviours or anything that I can do to get rid of her?
