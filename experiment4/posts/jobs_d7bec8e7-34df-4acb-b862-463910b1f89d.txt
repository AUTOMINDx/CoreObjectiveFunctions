Crying at work. Burnt out
I’m literally crying at work right now and I just want to faint and just wake up and it be next year. I feel like I’m literally working to love and it has me depressed and hating my job and my career. I recently, just started a new job three weeks ago because I hated the previous job and stated there for two months. Before that I was at my other job for three years and left because I started to resent the job due to lack of upward movement. It was a government job and you literally had to jump through hoops just to get a promotion and even if you did it they will say there is a hiring freeze due to budget cuts. 
I overall feel like my career has made me recent my choices and my life. I always wanted to help people and I chose the profession of being a therapist and I knew the field didn’t make much money but now living with it for many years has made me depressed and upset. I currently work 3 jobs just to be able to pay my bills and save money. I am now ready to change careers but then I’m getting discouraged because it seems like it will take a while in order to do that and I would need to get certifications and already I work 60 hours a week and don’t have much time to do that.

I just want a way out now but also be able to pay my bills and be okay.

I can’t do it anymore, I feel like I’m losing my mind. I just want to scream. I also feel like I’m being overworked. This new job wants us to 30 people minimum a week and that’s not including the abundance of paperwork they want you to do and they give you a caseload of 45 clients just to get paid 55k. I’m over it!
