My job description said “will work alone” now my boss is there every day and won’t stop talking.
Hello, 8 months ago I took a job that on all accounts was a dream for me. My boss said “I only come once every two weeks” which was true. Recently however, his 20+ years of work employee who worked along side him, and pretty much the only reason my boss kept working out on the field (he’s an older man 85 to be exact and this employee is younger and would help with all physical aspects of the job) not only quit but sued him for emotional damage, harassment, stress and all this other stuff. 

Everyone (2 more servicemen who work out on the field and myself) thought this meant he was going to retire and stay home and come in occasionally like always. However we recently found out his wife does not like it when he is home and apparently he says he does not want to be home either. He tried out working with one or the servicemen who told him that it wasn’t working out for him.

For the last 3 weeks he has been in the office every day and I think I would be open to the change if he was a good boss, but he is incredibly needy. He constantly needs my attention, at least every two minutes he has something to say and it’s gotten to the point where I had to politely silence him and tell him I’m working. He pries and asks what I’m doing and proceeds to order me to do things in a way that don’t make sense. I told him I have a system in place and that I will do things my way since tor the last 8 months there doesn’t seem to be a problem. You can tell he gets upset. I feel that he is lonely and I’ve heard him on the phone with his wife and she is very cold and distant with him so he turns to me. I have no sympathy for him because conversations start off innocent and he ends up talking about how he takes viagra. Should I just quit or have a talk?
