My boss is unusually focused on me .. I hate it
Should I quit my job if I dislike my boss?

He (45M)seems to like me (btw i’m 20sF) and wants to hold 1:1 meetings 1-2x a week even if I insist on providing written updates and such.  

Everyone else on our team holds them twice a month. Its just insane and im uncomfortable. I get annoyed by everything he does and its just generally uncomfortable to be around him. 

Am i being unreasonable? I guess work just takes a big part of time, it doesn’t make sense to spend a lot of my time on it if it’s not working

I just feel like he cares to a large extent what I do vs everyone else

EDIT: PLEASE STOP ASKING ME TO DESCRIBE EXTRA DETAIL 
I DONT WANT TO GET DOXXED

“Well in addition to everything else I described about my boss, I definitely will. He’s a smart enough guy to put 2 and 2 together.
It’s not worth telling strangers to add more detail. I tried to be vague just to get more stories from people about similar situations to see how I can approach this.
