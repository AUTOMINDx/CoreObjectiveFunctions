What were some feelings / experiences in your life were symptoms of Emotional Neglect?
I'm in my 30s and have only recently stumbled upon the concept of Emotional Neglect. I had never heard of it before but it makes a lot of sense and helps explain a lot of the anxiety, sadness and tolerance for bad people that has happened during my life.

I was just wondering if anyone had odd thoughts, feelings or experiences that they now realize were symptoms of emotional neglect.

I recently joined this forum, but I saw a post about people feeling like they wouldn't live very long. This took me back to my teens and early 20s where I couldn't picture myself living into my 40s and 50s. I couldn't imagine myself with a successful career or a wife and family. Even though I was relatively smart and ok looking.

I hadn't had any relatives or friends die early or anything like that. Neither did I have a concrete fear of dying from an accident or disease. It was just a malaise that I couldn't see myself living very long. From what I've saw in the thread it was a common trait amongst those who've experienced emotional neglect.

I guess I'm just looking for others to share similar examples of things which are symptoms of emotional neglect.
