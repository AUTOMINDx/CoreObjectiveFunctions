possible acetaminophen poisoning
19M 6’2 205 in relatively good shape, fresh off shoulder surgery a week and a half ago

i was prescribed oxycodone/acetaminophen for my pain meds and kinda got addicted to them, i am not an avid drug user besides occasionally weed. the pain meds were 5/325 and i consumed around 6000-10000mg of acetaminophen over the span of 2 days or so (not just from the oxy capsules). i stopped using about 36 hours ago now. yesterday i threw up one time after having a cold sweat for most of the day but felt better, but today i have felt nauseous all day and only threw up when i woke up. i’m not going to the hospital unless it gets extremely bad, since the antidote doesn’t have much effect 24+ hours after ingestion. what should i do and should i be very concerned about this?

edit: it has now been 48 hours since the last ingestion, my appetite is coming back and my nausea is mostly gone. i have listened to you guys and i know i am very stubborn and if i have any other symptoms pop up tomorrow i will go to the er. thanks everyone ❤️
