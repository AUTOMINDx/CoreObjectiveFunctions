I(18F) really need some help, please. I don't know what to do. I am having a hard time trying to decide a uni program. I'd really appreciate some help (TL;DR at the top)
**TL;DR:** 18F, wanted to be a teacher, got confused, applied to and rejected math programs, graduated high school 2021, went back to high school to do science courses, still confused about what to do

\--------

I am sorry for the long post. 

I am **18F (Ontario, Canada)** and will be applying to universities by the second week of December. But I still don't know what to do. 

**Background**

I am doing my fifth year of high school. I graduated high school in Jun 2021, and, until April, had decided to go to university for math. Last year, when I was in grade 12, I had applied to several math programs and by April, I realized that math may not be the best program for me. From childhood to the middle of grade 12, I'd always wanted to be a teacher, but I didn't know what to teach, so decided math as one of the teachables. During the application and admission process, I wsa very confused about the decisions. In high school, I took mostly math and business courses. I didn't take science after grade 10 because I thought I hated it. Because of several factors, one major one being that I wasn't confident and prepared to go to university for Math, I decided to go back to school for some science courses. However, I intend to go to post-secondary in 2022.

In high school, I took Business, Marketing, Accounting and Economics courses. Even though I enjoyed my Business and Marketing classes, I really hated Economics and Accounting seemed boring. Honestly, I have no interest in opening up a business or ending up in a corporate job.

I really don't like Computer Science. I took it twice in High School, and the only part I liked was the programming part - Python and Processing. But I could never understand, and still don't understand, a thing about hardware/software and all those things. I have scored some of my worst marks in Comp Sci. I'm pretty sure I am not interested in pursuing a career in Comp Sci, however, I'd like to know more about this field. **What kind of careers are there in Compuer Science?**

I really like History, but I'd really like to keep it as a hobby rather than pursue a career in it. I'm scared I'll end up hating it. Also, I don't know what I can do with History anyways. Same with Anthropology, I really liked it in school, but I'm not sure if I can make a career out of it. I feel like it's better to keep them as hobbies, or maybe minors if I have the chance.

Psychology was okay. Interesting enough to read about it in my free time. I have no interest in pursuing a career in Psychology though. 

I like Biology. I am interested in it. It seems fun. But I am not interested in becoming a doctor, dentist or a vet at all. I don't want to be a surgeon - I hated (frog) dissection, I don't want to do anything like that. Also, I really like the biological aspect of Physical Anthropology, so I'm not sure if my interest in Biology stems from that. I am considering nursing now, but I don't know if it is the right fit for me. **What other careers can I consider in Biology that aren't very health/medical related? Iâ€™m open to listening about health related careers too.**

So far Chemistry is manageable, but I don't like it. I'd like to not take Chemistry, if possible. But if I was forced to take one or two courses, I think that's okay. I'm not looking for something that's chem heavy. 

I cannot do Physics. I just cannot do it. I don't understand Physics, and I have tried everything from tutoring, getting additional help from my teacher and parents, but Physics is just not for me. A big NO.

Math has been okay. I do well in Math, I had been good in Math. I even applied to math programs last year. But I had trouble with calculus and vectors, like a lot, especially vectors. I couldn't understand a thing, and that's what made me really scared and reject the those programs. **What careers can I consider in Math?**

Geography seems interesting. I really like maps, looking at maps, even making maps (even though I am not good at it). I haven't tried any software to make maps yet. I have just started to look into GIS. It seems interesting, but I've yet to know more about it. **What can I do in Geography/GIS?**

I am also looking into some environmental programs - science and management programs. I like to spend time in nature and feel strongly for the environment. **What are some careers in the environment field?**  

I haven't looked into trades. **What are some careers in trades that I can consider?**

I'm not sure if my hesitation or lack of interest in other subjects/careers is because I was so deadset on becoming a teacher and going to university that I never explored or researched anything else. I've wanted to travel and maybe that's the reason teaching seemed amazing to me. I'd like to keep teaching as my backup plan. I feel like I have no other major interests. I really don't know what other careers even exist. But I do know that I'm not really into research/academia, business, medicine, and engineering. **I prefer to not have a desk job.**

I don't know which programs I should apply to. I don't want to end up in a program that doesn't help me in any way or waste money. **I don't know which direction I should head in.** I'd really appreciate some help and guidance. Thank you so much! And once again, sorry for the long post.
