Dropped out of pre-med. graduated and feeling lost.
Some background info: I’m 22 and I have a BA in Psychology. My original plan was to go to med school but i did not get in and i basically lost all motivation. In hindsight, I should’ve picked a better major instead of putting all my eggs in one basket. Right now, I’m just working at starbucks saving up money.I did some thinking during this “gap year” and I realized I didn’t want to have anything to do with healthcare. It’s better to realize now I don’t want to do something then let a patient suffer with a practitioner that hates their job. I grew up in an Asian family so you already know doctor or lawyer were the only career options for me. So yes, I did not go into medicine because I had a passion for it. 

I’m kinda feeling depressed and lost right now because I know you can’t do much with a degree in psych. I know you can do HR but i’m not sure it’s the right career for me. I know right now tech is a booming industry so maybe I can throw my lot in there? I’m not computer savvy and I’m not sure if I will enjoy coding or if a bootcamp is even worth it if i don’t even like coding. I’ve looked at marketing/sales in tech or even finance/investment banking (my friend’s dad works in investment banking; possible internship) which necessarily don’t require specific degrees(?). Any input is helpful.

Edit: Thank you for whoever gave me the award! I hope my situation and the advice I got here will help other people in a similar situation.
