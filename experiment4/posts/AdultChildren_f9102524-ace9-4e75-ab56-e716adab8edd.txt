If anyone would like to share/vent anything that’s come up this week, I’d love to commiserate.
I was doing so well the past couple weeks and Sunday I woke up angry and irritated, have been on an emotional roller coaster since. Today Ive been feeling like I hate being an ACA and I wish that my story were different. My thinking is terrible today, with emotions all over the map and my inner critic running rampant, trying to convince me that Im completely crazy and broken. Myself and my life just don’t feel real today and I’m feeling incredibly lost. 

If anyone can relate or would like to share, I’d love to know I’m not alone 🤍
