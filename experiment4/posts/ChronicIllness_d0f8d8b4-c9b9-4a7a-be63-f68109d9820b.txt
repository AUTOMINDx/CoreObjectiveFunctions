Too Poor to Be Sick and Too Sick to Be Poor
I want to get help for my health issues, but I'll need to get a second job to pay for it. If I get a second job, I'll make all of my health issues exponentially worse. I haven't had to work two jobs since I was in high school, and thinking about having to go through that again is terrifying, but I don't think I had a choice. Even if I don't get help for my health issues, Ill still need to get a second job anyway.

I feel bad for complaining; I have an awesome job at a lab that pays decent and doesn't demand any physical labour, but it isn't enough, unfortunately. I'm hoping I get this job at Starbucks so I don't have to do overnights at McDonalds again.

I really can't win. I wish I was healthy. I'm not suicidal, but everyday I wish I could just fall asleep forever. I'm so tired.

EDIT: Thank you all for the comments, they are very helpful as well as nice:) I don't know if anyone cares, but I have an interview at Starbucks next week! I will also be looking into healthcare options:D
