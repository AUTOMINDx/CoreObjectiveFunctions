I just accepted my dream job after 2 years in a toxic role that I can’t wait to leave. How do I stay motivated for the remaining couple weeks at my current job that I hate?
The company I accepted the new role at is one I previously worked at as a contractor, and I really enjoyed working there! Unfortunately they were going through a reorganization when my contract ended, and couldn’t offer me a role, which is how I ended up at my current company. I currently work at a company with about 20 people, and in the past year, we’ve at over 50% turnover. There’s only 5 people at this company who have been here longer than a year. To say that management here is toxic and abusive is an understatement. I accepted a full time role at my former company, which comes with a 40k pay bump, better benefits, and better coworkers. I’m soooo excited to start this new role, however I’m not planning to resign from my current role until after the holidays. How do I stay motivated with the holidays and this new job on the horizon?
