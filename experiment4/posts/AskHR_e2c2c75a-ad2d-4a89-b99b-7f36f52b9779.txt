[GA]Email from Boss sounds and looks like a PIP, should I treat it like one?
Hi Everyone,

I’m not going to give you much background info on the situation to keep this brief other than to say I’ve been struggling with my job lately with a very high workload and feeling a great deal of stress and my performance has suffered because of it.  The stress has begun to effect my physical and mental health and I’ve been prescribed anxiety meds and started talking to a Counselor.  

Today I got an email from my Boss pointing out a number of issues with my performance and suggesting ways to improve.  

It was not titled as a written warning or a true PIP.  It was also only addressed to me and my COO and/or HR were not copied on the email.

However, the email looks and feels very much like a written warning or PIP and in effect it probably is.

I’m going to reply to it with brief and non defensive answers to his direct questions but my question at this point is should I treat this like a true warning or PIP?

Should I be requesting that we meet with HR present?

I want to make sure if he’s really treating this like a disciplinary action that HR should be involved.
