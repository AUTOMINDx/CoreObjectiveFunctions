AITA for causing a mass quitting?
I was done with the company as they cut our pay to “avoid laying off anyone” but then we posted record profits but they didn’t increase our salaries or give us the 10% bonus everyone was promised. 20% of the department already quit but I was hanging on a bit hoping to ride in out until next year.

Then the boss yelled at an intern for asking to go home early and have time off because her mom just called her to tell her her cat was dying and to go to straight to the vets. She wanted a few days off and the boss basically told her cats were animals and she wasn’t allowed to request time off unless it was a human dying. He was supposed to discuss it in private but decided to just go to a corner of the office where my team overheard him. She was crying and grabbed her stuff and ran out of the office.

I sent a company wide email (which is standard) saying I was quitting and highlighted the interaction between the boss and the intern (though I didn’t name names) as the main reason. Then immediately like 10 people emailed me back to ask me who the manager was and to avoid leaving a trace I told them in person and within a few days most people knew. 

I work IT where finding a new job now is really easy and tons of friends would offer me referrals into their companies immediately. I found another job within the 2 weeks and am starting on Monday. There’s been over 2 dozen people sending quitting emails and now the company is shutting down peoples emails a few days before they leave so they can’t send goodbye emails and link their LinkedIn or phone numbers so current employees can’t find them to piggy back to the next company.

The boss came to berate me as he was being disciplined and might lose his job. I don’t feel sorry for him because he’s a jerk but his family is going to be hard hit because he doesn’t have any marketable skills other than PowerPoint. AITA here?
