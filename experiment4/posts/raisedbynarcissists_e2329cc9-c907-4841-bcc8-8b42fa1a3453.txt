I was raised by narcissists. Then I married one. She drove our daughter to so much despair that she tried to kill herself. And who gets blamed by the authorities? Me.
When my daughter tried to kill herself, I went full on agressive with the mother. I went to CPS, to the hospital, my daughter told them about the abuse in detail. And specified very clearly that I was a loving father who never abused her.

Then came waltzing the narcissist. First she put CPS in her fucking pocket. "Boohoo, I know I haven't done everything right, but this was blown out of proportion by my ex, who wants to destroy me".

Early December my kid was hospitalized, because of her mom. She abused her in the hospital room, told her "You've got nothing, you're just doing this to get attention". My child told hospital staff **four times** she didn't want to see her.

I told the doctors "She's going to manipulate you". Shrink waves me off. "Don't worry, we're professionals". Lo and behold, they let her into the room. "She just wanted to say hello".

Now my beloved daughter, the apple of my eye, is in foster care because I am "overly protective and damaging the relationship with the mother". 

It's Christmas Eve and I am alone, at home, wailing uncontrollably.

**EDIT**: thank you so much for the support. It means a ton. I didn't know where to turn.
