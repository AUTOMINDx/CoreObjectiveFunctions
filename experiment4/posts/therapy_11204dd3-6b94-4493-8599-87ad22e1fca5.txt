Continue with therapist or no?
Ive only had like 2 sessions with my therapist. Im absolutely new to therapy, hes my very first  therapist. I dont know if hes good or not though. I dont know if im wasting my time with him or if he and I click or not.
Im comfortable with english but I speak another language and I speak that with him. He can understand english but I dont think hes 100% comfortable with it so I just default to the other one. 
In my first session, I just cried and told him everything from the moment he told me to fill out my personal details form till the end. The second session, he made me draw a person and write a story abt their past, present and future and feelings and said wed discuss them next session. He taught me to breathe too. 

I don’t necessarily feel like I love him or hes great. I feel like he judges me. And mocks me for knowing about mental health a bit or for having a name for what I think I have. Like I told him I thought I had adhd and he kind of sorta scoffed and asked me what symptoms I thought showed that. In both sessions. Made me feel like hes not paying attention to what I say or listening to me. I told him I had trouble sleeping and staying asleep and he just told me ‘sleeping longer is necessary’. I told him I had an eating disorder and the next session he asks ‘how did you eat this week?’ And I said ‘my normal way.’ And he just said ‘ok good’
