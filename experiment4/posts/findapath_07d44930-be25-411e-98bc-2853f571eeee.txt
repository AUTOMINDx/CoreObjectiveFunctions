18yo Uni Dropout Working in Retail
Hi, I'm 18 years old and recently dropped out of my first year of University after a few months. I couldn't handle the workload and stress that comes with Uni life, it seems to kinda seep into every aspect of my life and make me miserable. 

I'm currently working for Costco pushing carts for $16 CAD an hour or about 12.50 USD. I can't say I really enjoy the job at all, but it's not the worst thing ever. I just don't really like working all that much to be honest, especially doing work that is utterly meaningless. I also feel like my passions won't get me anywhere in life, I enjoy art and music but I'm not particularly talented in either. 

I feel completely stuck and have no idea what to do. I often fantasize about just packing everything up and just driving playing music wherever I go, but I know that's not exactly profitable. Plus I don't even have my full driver's licence yet, or a car. I'm really stuck and would appreciate any help!
