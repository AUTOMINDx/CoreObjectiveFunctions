My mom got drunk before my dry wedding
My wife's parents don't drink. They're missionaries and assume we don't drink. Piece of cake, told our friends and my family they'd have to hide it until her parents left. No one complained and we had plenty of partying after they went to bed.

Out of all of our friends (20-30 year olds who smoke/drink) and our family no one had an issue except my mom. I realized at 9:30 that morning my mom somehow got shit faced. She was supposed to drive to the venue to finalize the menu but she couldn't speak.

I've never heard anyone slur so badly. I drove for her and had to tell her to sit and be quiet so I could so the talk to the venue manager. She somehow thought no one was noticing how drunk she was. She was supposed to be the one who drove the bride/bridesmaids to the wedding in 2 hours. We got someone to explain what happened to my wife and got someone else to drive. I'm not sure if my in laws ever caught on..

She called me a few days later on my honeymoon to apologize and explain that she didn't have a problem ðŸ™„. She said was just nervous about being around my sister since they have a bad relationship.
