[MA] HireRight - Unpaid internship "unable to verify" and ask for W2/1099.
It’s an unpaid internship at a small non-profit and HireRight keeps asking for a W2/1099. I provided a signed letter on the non-profits letterhead confirming my internship during the specific time period. I’ve also provided the email, phone numbers, and website of the nonprofit where they can contact to get more info. They keep saying “unable to reach” - which is definitely not true since I am in contact with the nonprofit and no one called them. I am not sure what else to provide to have this internship cleared.

Everything else is cleared and no issues at all (no criminal or court records, drug testing clear, other jobs complete without discrepancies).

Might be overthinking and it will work out but this is a job that I’ve been dreaming about.
