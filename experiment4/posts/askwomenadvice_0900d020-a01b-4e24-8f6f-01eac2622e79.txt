How can I create a meaningful life without having children? 29f
I have always wanted to have kids and always thought it would happen by now. I don’t feel pressured by my family or have a strong desire to focus on my career. I’m always seeing things and think “oh that would be fun to take a kid to!” and love adventures with my nieces and nephews. 

I feel like I’m living kind of small and boring and waiting for my life to begin. 

How can I focus on what I have right now and create a beautiful life regardless of if I have children or not?
