I have a big, scary phone call this morning and could use some encouragement
This phone call could end up very badly messing up my life (not exaggerating), or it could end up being okay. 

Of course, I'm going through all the worst case scenarios.

I think I'm going to put on makeup (which I never do), clean my face, and dress nicely. Maybe it'll give me a fake confidence boost?

I have had nightmares ALL night long because of this call.

**Edit: The phone call actually went well and the person was patient with me and listened to how I messed something up and basically said they are giving me an extension so that I *don't* mess everything up. I'm not going to lose my paycheck after all.**
