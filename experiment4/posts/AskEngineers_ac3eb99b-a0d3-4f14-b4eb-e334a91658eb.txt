Where do you work if you dislike the manufacturing and blue collar environment ?
Excuse me for being blunt, but would an EPC firm be the right place to go? I just don't mesh well with the "rough around the edges"/"union" people - it's not for me, and I've tried, and as much as I like them I feel like I'd be happier in a different environment. Has anyone else found a different place?

My background is chemical engineering by the way?

Thanks,

UPDATE: y;all are funny, i can't stop laughing, also how do non-engineers stumble upon us LOL
