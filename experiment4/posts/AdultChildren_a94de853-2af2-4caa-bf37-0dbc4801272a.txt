I'm afraid I'll live with this feeling for the rest of my life
I'm so angry and sad and dreading and tired. I spent this Christmas in the hospital. My father developed throat cancer as a result of his drinking. Then, lymph cancer in his neck. Most recently, he developed pneumonia and sepsis from an infection by his feeding tube. Last time I saw him was Thanksgiving. In and out of the hospital, he was very swollen, couldn't talk, and couldn't move well. He still managed to drink beer with a straw though.

Now, he's on a respirator, and mute from an emergency trachecotomy they had to perform. His severe liver cirrhosis has created fluid buildup around his liver and lungs, and the treatments they can use are limited because of the damage the drinking has done on his body.

I'm 20 years old, home for college break in my childhood home. Every break is awful, every time I have to come back to this dilapidated, falling apart, sad, sad house, I am consumed with dread and anger. I can't possibly forsee myself getting over this shitty childhood and adolescence I am experiencing. I'm so tired, and so scared that I will just never move on from this anger, this need for pity, believing I have been dealt such a great injustice. I'm so confused and overwhelmed, I don't feel I'm equipped for this chapter of my life. I feel like at 20, the least of my worries should be if my parents are going to die and what times I can interact with my mom before she becomes too drunk and mean to hold a conversation. I have no siblings, I have no concrete support system, I'm so lost I'm so angry I'm so sad and I'm so so so tired.
