Why is Napoleon always mentioned in the same breath whenever the genocidal conquerors of history are brought up (Genghis Khan, Caesar, Hitler, Atilla etc.)? Was he ever known to be unusually cruel or genocidal?
Don't know much about Napoleon since I'm not that interested in that era of history, but everything I look up online tends to cover his military/political tactics, and I'm not seeing much of anything in the way of "evil conqueror" type stuff. What am I missing?
