What phrase or word that your narcissistic parent said that still triggers you to this day?
My mom is my narc parent and her favorite line she likes to use even to this day even though I'm 25 with a son of my own "You know don't have to lie to me" when I refuse to tell her about my personal life.

Edit: seeing all these replies breaks my heart. It's heartbreaking that anyone ever goes through the experiences of having a/or nparent(s). I send you all virtual hugs and that one day certain phrases or words will no longer have triggers or effect us in a way.
