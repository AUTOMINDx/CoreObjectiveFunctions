I started an elimination diet 2 weeks ago, and my day-to-day anxiety has decreased by 90%
Please note that I am not a doctor, mental health professional or nutritionist. I am just someone who has suffered from a lot of anxiety over the last 5 years, and have had the most symptom-free 2 weeks in years since I started this elimination diet.

What I eliminated: 

* packaged junk food (cookies, potato chips, crackers, etc)
* grains (all breads, pastas, flour)
* anything with added sugar (with an exception for honey which I add to my morning coffee)
* diet cola (this was a big one for me since I was consuming about 2 liters per day of the stuff)
* most dairy (but will make an exception for salad dressings, or occasional parmesan cheese)

What I now eat:

* 1 cup of coffee in the morning, with soy milk and honey
* salads
* chicken, some red meat in moderation
* sweet potatoes
* cous cous, lentils
* nuts
* fruit
* vegetables
* eggs
* drinking lots of water instead of my diet cola habit

What I suspect may have been happening before was that my bad diet was screwing up my blood sugar levels and/or blood pressure as a result I was getting a lot of weird physical symptoms (occasional light-headedness, chest pains, migraines, vertigo, etc) which was then triggering my anxiety which was then triggering more health symptoms and it was a vicious cycle. Or perhaps I had a gluten sensitivity and that was the problem.

That, or my diet cola addiction was putting so much caffeine and/or chemicals into my system and that was causing my phsyical symptoms which was triggering anxiety and on it went. 

I also have an itchy/dandruffy scalp and rosacea problem, and that has not gone away, but I am hoping I may see some improvement after a couple months on this new lifestyle/diet.

Anyway, I am posting this here in hopes that it may help someone else. Like I mentioned earlier, I am not a medical professional and am aware there are many non-diet reasons people suffer with anxiety, but I really think this may help others out there like me. Take care.
