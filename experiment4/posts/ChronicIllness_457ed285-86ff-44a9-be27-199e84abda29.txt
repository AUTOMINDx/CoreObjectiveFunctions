I'm so happy Im crying. I NO LONGER NEED A NEW KIDNEY &amp; MY CAT IS GOING TO BE OKAY
Both me and my cat have been struggling with intense health issues for a while. Me a lot longer. I got news this week that Jack has made an amazing and shocking recovery and no longer are planning to have him put down. AND BECAUSE IM NOW MEDICATED AND STOPPED DRINKING I NO LONGER NEED TO BE ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST!!! IM FUCKING CRYING! I DONT NEED A NEW KIDNEY ANYMORE!!! OH MY GOD!!!! I'll of course stay medicated, keep with my team of doctors, stay using my cane and such but as of yesterday,my kidney recovered enough. Oh my god I just want to shout it off the rooftops. So much weight has been lifted at once off my chest. I feel a new drive for life!
