Stop limiting yourself and selling yourself short.
Many times I see "I know this is silly" or "Apologies for the stupid question." You are doing yourself a disservice. None of us know until we investigate, ask and are taught. If you think that a question isn't worth asking sometimes you'll feel embarrassed to ask and you will never know the truth.

You are not dumb, your questions are not stupid and the pursuit of knowledge should not be shamed.
