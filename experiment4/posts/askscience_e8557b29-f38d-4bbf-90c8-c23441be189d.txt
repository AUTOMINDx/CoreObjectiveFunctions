Is there such a thing as excess blood in your system? Hypothetically speaking what would happen to someone if you gave them a rapid blood transfusion when they didn't need one thus filling them up with more blood than they need?
I was watching a youtube let's play and after getting hit real bad one of the commentators said it was fine, they had too much blood anyway. While obviously a joke it got me curious what would happen if that were a real thing.
