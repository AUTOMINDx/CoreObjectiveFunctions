Is socializing a moral responsibility?
Growing up in a very anti-social environment (suburban New England), where neighbors rarely engage with each other, I was at some point imparted with a very strong sense of the need for community — and to intentionally foster community. I think this is one of the few things we can do to stem the eroding force/deterritorialization of capitalism, for instance.

I've formulated this sentiment *morally* as follows: if everyone behaved anti-socially, the world would be (in my mind, objectively) a worse place. That's about as far as my formula extends, but it's powerful enough to spur me to action.

I also have, and have had, social anxiety. It takes work to manage it, but it's generally surmountable. Certainly, I've come to feel more comfortable socializing with repeated positive encounters, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that I'm an extrovert. Every so often, I feel good socializing, but I also need a lot of time to myself. Anyway.

My wife is much less social than me and is an introvert in the extreme. There are a few people she feels completely comfortable with, and avoids most everyone else. Without veering into r/relationships, she was surprised to hear that I felt we had a *moral* obligation to socialize, to host occasionally, to communicate with our neighbors. Are there philosophers (Kant, e.g.) that might agree with me / my reasoning, or is this question squarely in the realm of relationship advice and *not* philosophy?

Thanks :)

Edit: I won't ask my wife to read moral philosophy
