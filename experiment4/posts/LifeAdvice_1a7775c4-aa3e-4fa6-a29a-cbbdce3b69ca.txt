22 years old, feeling like everything is going wrong.
I guess I'm writing this because I've never been so great at vocally sharing. I'm 22 years old, and I have no idea what to do with my life. Is it normal to feel like that? Everything lately has felt like its been crashing down. My girlfriend of two years and I have decided to end things because she wanted to be proposed to now, and then married by the summer. I could not in complete confidence agree to this because I just don't want to make our lives miserable with early struggle. There will always be problems, but right now, I'm nothing. I'm in my last semester of college, pursuing an Electrical and Computer Engineering degree. I'm not going to lie, it started out as a breeze, and online classes the past two years due to the pandemic made things a bit more easier as well. But this last semester has just been kicking my ass in every regard. I'm on the verge of failing one of the most important courses that I need to graduate, and the worst thing is - its a group project! I was let go a few months ago from my tutoring job because there weren't enough students left to work with due to the pandemic - and so I'm not in the best financial state either. I guess this just circles back to me telling the girl I loved for so long that I can't deliver right now - that if I had everything, I would get down on a knee, propose, and then get married in a heartbeat. But now I've lost her, she won't wait. Like I said previously, things have just been the worst. I'm grateful for my life, things can always be much, much worse. But at this current point in time, I feel lost, and without a purpose. And when these immediate stresses exit, I'm a bit terrified to face the reality of what's next. I don't mean to mope around. I definitely do want to take action. Some advice from anyone would be appreciated right now. Thanks for reading.
