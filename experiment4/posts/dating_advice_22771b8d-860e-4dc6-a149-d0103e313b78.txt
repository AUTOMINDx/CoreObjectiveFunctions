The girl I like offers to help me move. Should I accept it?
(I'm 25M, she's 25F)

I am moving to a new place and the girl I like, upon hearing this, offered to give me a hand. I though she was just being polite, but yesterday she mentioned it again when we were onto the subject.

I don't have that much stuff, so by myself I can make it in 2-3 trips. Will it be a good opportunity for me to spend time with her? Or will she feel troubled? We don't have a car so it will take about 40min per trip by subway.

If I were to accept it, how should I ask? "Do you perhaps have time tomorrow to help me move?" "Afterwards we can maybe go to the cafe we talked about."?
