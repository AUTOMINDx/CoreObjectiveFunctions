My Nephew Died Yesterday
My oldest nephew turned 17 today. Instead of celebrating with his family, he was hooked up to a breathing machine and laying on a cot in a hospital. 

Brain dead.

I was there when he was born. I helped babysit him. I've been with him so much of his life. He was like a little brother to me.

I feel so broken. So helpless.

I want to hug him again. Tell him I love him.

Please love on the people you hold most dear. You just never know what freak accident will end their life.
