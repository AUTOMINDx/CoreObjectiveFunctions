[Spider-Man NWH] Spoilers about a minor plot points
Again; spoiler alert..



So Dr. Strange casts the final spell and causes everyone to forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man… but everyone still remembers Spider-Man (as apparent by J.Jonah’s report after the spell).  Doesn’t Pete just have to go back to the sanctuary and reintroduce himself to Dr. Strange?  It’s not like he and Strange had this incredibly well developed relationship.  They fought together and saved the world, but they weren’t hanging out in NYC, right?


Also; what happened to all of those copies of Flashpoint?  Isn’t there written word everywhere about Parker being Spider-Man?  Newspapers, books… an entire display devoted to him on his highschool…. Did all of that just disappear?
