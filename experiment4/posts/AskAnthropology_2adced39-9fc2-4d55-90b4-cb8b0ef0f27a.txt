"Early human kinship was matrilineal" How true is this statement today?
I was wondering how accurate is this statement like could early human kinship be more diverse? 

EDIT: trying to make a better question to explain what I am trying to understand

is there any theory that most anthropologist agree on what the early human kinship was? Like are we still uncertain if the early human kinship was Matrilineal, or could there have been a mix of Matrilineal, and Patrilineal?


Does it have to be a binary where its either Matrilineal, or Patrilineal for early humans?
