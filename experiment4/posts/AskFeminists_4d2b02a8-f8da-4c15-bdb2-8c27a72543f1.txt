Help! Radical feminist book about motherhood?
Hello friends!

Some time ago I came across a book written by a radical feminist on different aspects of her life as a woman. 

I particularly remember one chapter about child rearing. She has a baby with her male partner and describes how even though they were set on gender equality within the family, she ended up with the main responsibility. She developed an intuition, always knew what the child needed etc., and her partner didn't. After about a year they wrote a schedule to share everything equally, and after a long while, her partner caught up.

Any suggestions which author this might be??? Please help, I am starting to get through to my straight sister!
