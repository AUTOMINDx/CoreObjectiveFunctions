Entitled aunt took my cousin who had covid to small family get together
This story only took place about 5 days ago 
so my aunt bought her child to the family get to together at my other aunts house who recently had a new born. so my cousin who had covid was around every one without a mask and kissing the new born and my sister was around her but didn't catch covid until later. when she might have caught it from my little sister yesterday .but the part that makes this 10 times worse is that my aunt came to the party knowing she might have covid and not telling anyone .so at the time of us finding out she had covid we were at a Dave and  busters so my mom was crying and ranting at the fact that we might have gotten covid. because she and my little sister were  feeling bad all day so we went straight to a covid rapid testing thing and we all tested negative but we found out the test wasn't very accurate .so they went again but to a non rapid test and found out that my little sister ,dad ,mom and probably 
big sister (because she was having chest pain)  got infected .so now we have to quarantine
for the rest of my birthday Christmas and new year because my aunt is to stupid and irresponsible to mention her kid might have covid .


TLDR: my aunt brought her kid who has  covid to a get together knowing she might have covid
