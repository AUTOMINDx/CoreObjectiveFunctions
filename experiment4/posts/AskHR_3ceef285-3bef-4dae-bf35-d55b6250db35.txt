[CA] do we have to report employees that are being physically abused ?
A manager recently today talked to an employee about her negative attendance. The employee revealed to her that she gets abused by boyfriend &amp; he fights with her everyday before work which makes her late.

She stated that (an injury she previously had) was because of her boyfriend.

The employees daughter works work the company as well &amp; always seems to have anxiety or worried about her mom.

Everything makes sense that she is possibly being abused.

How are employees supposed to respond? are we mandated to report this? Should we send the employee to counseling ?
