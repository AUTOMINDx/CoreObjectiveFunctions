Is r/femaledatingstrategy satire?
No disrespect, at all, just a legit question. Are they being serious with the posts?

I saw something posted on another sub making fun of the FDS sub and have now been there reading for a bit. I laughed pretty good at the top 2 or 3 posts, then my wife came over to see what I had been giggling at. She LOST it over a couple posts and then asked me if the women here are serious. I don't know... are they?

My wife and I both agree that it HAS to be satire. Again, no disrespect to any of the women there who ARE taking it seriously, I wish you the best of luck... I guess.

Edit/update: I just tried to make a post in the sub, you have to wait for approval so I think "serious" is an understatement. Follow up question though, how is this allowed on reddit? Isn't it hate speech against a specific group?

Wow.

4th and FINAL EDIT: thanks for the awards and well expressed opinions. I learned a lot of new words and heard some cool insights. I just finished reading EVERY comment.

I would especially like to thank the user who posted this to FDS, best form of an answer I could have gotten. Thanks!
