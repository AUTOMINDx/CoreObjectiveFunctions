How do I answer the "why are you looking" question? [FL]
I started a job in August and am now looking again for the following reasons:

1) My manager had a nervous breakdown in my second week, where she made physical contact with me and subsequently took a long leave of absence. At this point we had not yet had a single meeting nor had I had onboarding. She came back for a month or so, but has since decided to leave permanently. The boss is anticipating it will take a year to fill this role. 
2) Because of this, I was running a department without meeting with someone until Month 3. Then I wasn't for a while. I am now back to doing this, but I am very much a placeholder. 
3) Also because of this, my title (not my pay) has changed four times. I have basically worn 20 different hats, been thrust into meetings with clients with no briefing, and presented an hour long talk at a conference with 30 minutes notice. I have tried to roll with it but...
4) Because of all the turmoil, the staff under me (who don't report to me) have started leaving in droves. As a result, I have worked 30 days straight to cover events we had booked but were short-staffed for. I was basically told that I get comp days for all of them, but won't be able to take them until the new person starts. 

I had an HR screen for a new job this morning and was too honest about the above for why I am leaving my job. Is there an HR-friendly way of saying the above without coming off like I'm negative or not a team player?
