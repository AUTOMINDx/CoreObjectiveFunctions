Did the Northeastern Native Americans in the future US northeast and eastern Canada along with the Great Lakes Indians build and maintain harbors for their trade routes in pre Colombian times?
(Like next to the Hudson River?)
Or put in less specific  terms, did the Native Americans have the trade infrastructure for the movement of large amounts of goods in their River  Canoes with for instance artificial (or semi artificial)  harbors. And would the storage infrastructure have supported more then occasional luxury goods (long distance)(canoes with food-stalks and fur if close enough can probably move the goods fast enough for rot to be prevented). Were native Americans self sufficient enough that dozens of canoes filled with goods  werenâ€™t in demand, only a dozen canoes?
