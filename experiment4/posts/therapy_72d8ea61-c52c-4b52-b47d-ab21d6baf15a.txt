My therapist keeps trying to rationalize my guilt and I hate it
So years ago I deep something HORRIBLE with malicious intent. The type of thing that, if it got out, would destroy me and everyone around me. I feel terrible about it and it’s basically caused me to lose most of my sanity. I came forward to a therapist about this and she basically justified it by saying that I was “in a bad place at the time” and that I “didn’t know any better”. I can’t stand it when she says that. I don’t know what to do but I’m not making any progress through these rationalizations. I’m certainly not bettering as a person.
