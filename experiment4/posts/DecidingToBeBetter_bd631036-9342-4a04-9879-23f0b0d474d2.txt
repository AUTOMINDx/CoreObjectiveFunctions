I'm done drinking for the foreseeable future
I never learned how to drink properly growing up, which has led to me not knowing my drink limit, becoming incredibly intoxicated, making an ass out of myself, and hating myself the next day.  I don't get drunk often, but when I do, I get really drunk. It's not good, and I am ready to stop.

I get snippy and argue with my boyfriend when I'm drinking for no reason at all, and he doesn't deserve it whatsoever. I won't let myself act like this and hurt him anymore, so I'm taking a good, long break from alcohol.  Who knows, maybe it'll be for good.
