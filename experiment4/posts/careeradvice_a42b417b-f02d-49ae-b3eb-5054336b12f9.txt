Four crucial tips for interviews
Being introverted, I've always hated interviews. Most of them are closer to interrogations with a constant stream of tough questions – in theory, it's just predicting the right answers to the right questions. No wonder that many feel stressed with interviews not knowing what to expect.

My best interviews have resembled conversations more than interrogations. With a less formal and rigid structure, you can more easily answer questions and connect with the interviewer. Here are four fundamental tips that impact your interview performance *significantly*.  


1. **Turn nervousness into excitement:** According to a [Harvard study](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xge-a0035325.pdf), turning your pre-interview anxiety into excitement is the best way to prepare for the interview. Many try calming down and being serene, but according to research your nervousness is more efficiently converted into enthusiasm. So for your next interview, listen to your favorite uplifting music and walk to the interview bursting with excitement!
2. **Turn it into a conversation and connect with the interviewer:** Get rid of the rigid structure of a normal interview by asking counter-questions. If you're asked about dealing with stress you can reflect on the company after answering: "Would you think that \[company\] is a stressful environment? How does my future team handle stress?" After the interviewer has responded you can connect with an statement of your own, like "I think handling stress is a crucial quality because great teams don't break under pressure" and continue it as a conversation.
3. **Prepare for the interview questions that are the toughest to answer**: I usually avoid preparing for questions, but answers to crucial questions like the starter "Tell me a bit about yourself" should roll of the tongue every single time: This first question sets the tone for the rest of the interview – I've bombed interviews just because I failed to answer this concisely. I tried to talk about how I managed to combine working and studying but ended up rambling about how hard coffee shop work is to a corporate office recruiter.
4. **Come in clean and confident**: Arriving to the interview in a sharp, smart, and clean outfit and confident manner makes for a great first impression. No matter how introverted or shy you are, a firm handshake and direct but friendly eye contact come a long way in creating an approachable and positive impression. Showering before an interview is a prerequisite.
