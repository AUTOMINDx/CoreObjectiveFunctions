Labeled a Job Hopper?
Hello,

Long story short, I graduated in 2020 when no one was hiring. As a result, I rushed into the first job that was tangentially related to my interests. The problem was this job was 90% commission which would be fine but the lead time per contract to payout is a year to 18 months. In retrospect, I truly liked this job but I believe I burned this bridge as I left after 7 months for another job that had a significantly higher salary. The problem is the company misrepresented my responsibilities and it turned out to be a data entry position. I have been there for 2.5 months but I plan on quitting by the end of the year. Even though I am gaining a large salary relative to my responsibilities, fundamentally it's a dead-end job.

Should I leave the second job on my resume and explain the second company misrepresented the job to me? Would it look better with a 3-month gap so I'm not labeled a job hopper? Any advice is greatly appreciated!Â   


Edit:  
Thank you for all the responses. I decided to keep my current job on my resume as I believe having a gap would probably look worse. Also, it was rash to consider quitting before securing a new job so I don't think I'll do that either.
