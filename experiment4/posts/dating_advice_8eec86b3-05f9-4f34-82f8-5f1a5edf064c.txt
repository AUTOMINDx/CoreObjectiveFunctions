If you have to self-edit or second guess your behavior to hold someone’s attention, move on. Don’t rely on mind games or tactics to maintain attraction.
There is still an abundance of Pick Up Artist tactics being pushed out there, but being re-branded as inner game advice.

One example is the concept of Push-Pull (i.e. going hot and cold with emotions) by being ‘authentic’.  This is utterly contradictory advice and thinly veiled manipulation, in the guise of self-determination. You can disagree with her, be independent, not be too available—but if at the core of this behavior, you are trying to create a certain hot-cold dynamic, you aren’t being authentic at all. In fact, you’re being manipulative and weak.

Keep things simple. If you want to be in a relationship with someone, you need the freedom to be yourself entirely, be comfortable around them, and not rely on withdrawal of yourself intentionally or establishing boundaries solely for the sake of appearing bold to hold their interest. Being truly busy and holding to your obligations will take care of everything. If you are modifying your baseline behavior for the sake of creating a dynamic in your relationship, it’s not authentic.

If you want to text or talk to them, text them. If you want to see them, reach out to them. Just don’t be overbearing and insecure. No need to analyze a next step to get a reaction, have the
emotional freedom to act how you want. If you can’t be yourself without them losing interest, they don’t have a high level attraction to begin with.

-Make physical activity a priority. Sports, martial arts, lifting, etc.

You can still have time for dating, and not intentionally withdraw yourself simply to elicit a reaction or gain her interest. Hold to your self development, be yourself unapologetically, and the rest with fall into place.
