Bringing up consensual incest. NSFW
I didn't meet my sister or even know she existed until she turned 18 and found me through the adoption agency our families used. We grew up across the country from each and I'm older by 4 years. Same birth parents. 

When we first met there was sexual tension, we immediately fell into a best friend type of relationship. Neither of us had known another full blood relative before and there was an instant bond. 

I ended up living with her for a year in our late/mid 20's. The sexual attraction and fantasies for her were very strong. We eventually were drunk and sleeping in the same bed every night which led to use falling asleep holding each other which led to us masturbating each other. At one point I almost penetrated her but couldn't bring myself to do it. She gave me oral for a couple of second and then straddled me and finished me with her hands. 

These encounters to me were all consensual but we've never spoken about it since or even when we were doing it. In the moment was just breathing and grinding. 

I've read up on sexual attraction between siblings who first meet as adults and I know incest fantasies aren't rare, but the fact that we acted on it and I'm still predominantly using those memories for my own satisfaction is destroying my mental health. My therapist is a woman around my age and I've been seeing her about 5 months now and I'm not sure how to bring this up.
