Can someone help calm me down please? I’m freaking the fuck out.
Hey guys, I got lost in rural Colorado and had to stop by a liquor store to ask for directions and I gave the guy (who said he was the owner) the address of the house I was looking for. It’s in a gated community and at the end of the road but I can’t fucking get the possibility out of my head that he’s going to come kill us.

Like who would by pass a security gate, in the middle of the freezing cold, in the snow, to come murder someone in the middle of nowhere. But my fucking brain won’t drop it.
