AITA for wearing a dress when I didn’t do a good job shaving?
It’s me again with another stupid clothing dilemma, yay. This happened when me (15F) and my dad (44M) went to a restaurant with my grandfather (71M) because it was my grandfather’s birthday.

I only shave my legs and armpits in the summer because shaving takes a lot of time and is as annoying as hell. My dad forces me to lift up my arms and he makes puking noises if I even have stubble. I’ve tried explaining that it’s impossible for me to get rid of all the hair. I have mostly Mediterranean ancestry so I have a lot of thick, dark hair.

I wore a new floral dress that I bought a few days before the dinner. My mom had dropped me off after we were in the car for two hours. Because of this the only shoes I had were doc martens. Not the most formal thing, but they were my only option. I shaved the night before but I missed a few spots. My dad kept saying, “you shouldn’t wear shit kickers to a nice dinner!” He has a point but I already tried to explain all of my other shoes were at my mom’s house. The dress he also complained about, and he said that my outfit made me look like Courtney Love (lol).

Then, he saw the leg hair that I missed. He told me that I looked dirty and unprofessional. As I’ve mentioned, I explained everything to my dad. However, I could have put more thought and effort into how I looked. I know that this is kind of petty, but AITA?
