Are normative statements ('I ought to do x, or I should do x) future tense or present tense?
That is, are they saying something about the future or the current moment in time? And if they are future tense, does that mean that we cannot have certainty about normative statements, given that we can only predict the future?

If I say 'I should wear a raincoat because it is raining outside,' am I talking about my behavior in the future, or am I saying something more timeless and universal-- like a declaration of a general rule that is to be followed under certain conditions?
