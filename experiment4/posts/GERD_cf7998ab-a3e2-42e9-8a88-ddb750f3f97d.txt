Worst flair up ever, any advice?
So for some context,  I'm a 27 year old female that's relatively healthy. I've been dealing with gerd since I was around 16. I've already made quite a few changes with my diet such as cutting out coffee, any carbonated drinks, chocolate, citrus  items and red sauces. Etc. I thought I was doing pretty dang good with managing things, with the diet alterations and taking prilosec OTC (I originally was taking Zantac before they recalled it.) 

Everything's been pretty good until a few days ago. It started as a little heart burn, took my meds so on so forth 3 days later I'm over here dying I feel like. My upper abdomen is bloated, pain to the left side, right side, my back (thought I had a kidney issue), my chest, was nauseated at the site of food, was forcing myself to eat something and would just cramp my stomach and it would come back up. Feels like a grown person has punched me square in the chest. I hate this! 

This has got to be my worst yet. I wanted to go to the walk in clinic but they suggested I go to the ER considering I was having such abdominal pain and chest pain. Blood work, ekg, urine, everything checked out perfectly fine. They determined it to be gerd related. 

So my question for you all is, when it gets this bad how do manage it so it doesn't get *so* bad? Need some new tips for my books lol

Sorry for the long post though! I appreciate you taking the time to read this far.
