I live in an underdeveloped country where when talking about government intervention and welfare this phrase is common: “you want the welfare of Norway/Sweden/Denmark without wanting to make what they made before [economic freedom to get rich]”. How right/wrong is this assertion?
If it is not clear, people here (in Brazil) say that these countries of Scandinavia are able to be good welfare state countries now because they were good free-market countries before, and our underdeveloped country couldn't turn into a developed country with these welfare and intervention policies, but should first become a developed country through a free-market economy and only then become a welfare state

I wonder if there is any truth in this reasoning
