At the end of WW2, the US produced 300,000 planes for military use. Could they do so again?
I'm asking because modern jet planes are more sophisticated and expensive than the biplanes used in WW2. 

Let's say the US gets into a hypothetical war with China for example, and both nations battle it out for air superiority over a particular region, after a year of this, the US loses 100 F-35 jets and 2 of their super expensive stealth bombers, could they produce more than enough to replace those numbers as they did in WW2?
