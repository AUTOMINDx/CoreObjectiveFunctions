MIL still positive for COVID but says she’s not contagious
So this has created a lot of “what do we do here” for our family being Christmas and all. My MIL, 65, fully vaccinated, plus booster, PLUS antibody therapy, does not drink or smoke, tested positive for COVID on December 4th. Her doctors told her that “she may still test positive for as much as 90 days, but as long as she quarantined for 10 days and was 24 hours without fever she could resume normal activity.” So she did the quarantine, and has never had a fever. However, she still tests positive on PCR tests (through yesterday), and has a cracked voice, runny nose, and just overall fatigue. Honestly she still looks and sounds sick. She says it’s fine for her to come for Christmas, per her doctor and the CDC, but we have a two year old and it concerns me. Am I being paranoid here?
