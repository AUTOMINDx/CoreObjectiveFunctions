Have we ever witness a star/Galaxy leave the observable universe?
I read that many stars are leaving the observable universe every seconds. 
Have we ever witnessed it ?


EDIT:

Thank you for all  your responses. After reading you all, I'd like to add to my question.

So we have this situation:

[US] ---- distance ---- [GALAXY/STAR/THING]

the --- are photons coming to us.

We are receiving light and there is a light lag/latency. So we are seeing the Thing with a delay.
With the expansion of the universe, the [distance] is growing, at a certain pace/"speed".

There is a pace at which light can reach us from the Thing. And there is a pace at which light cannot reach us anymore because it is growing faster than the light can travel to reach us.
So... there must be a point between those two speeds where at one point light can reach us and the next moment, light can't reach us anymore. 
No ?
