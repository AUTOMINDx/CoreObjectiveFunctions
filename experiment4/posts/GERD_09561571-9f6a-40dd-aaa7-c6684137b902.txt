Dabbing with GERD?
So I was diagnosed with GERD around mid 2018, and I cut out drinking almost immediately aside from the occasional whiskey/Guinness(1 or 2 a year). I have still been a pretty heavy weed smoker/dabber up until about 2 weeks ago, because I noticed it was making my throat dry and scratchy. I don’t smoke cigarettes/vape. Does anybody else have this issue? I have no problem cutting smoke out of my diet as well, but if I don’t have to I’d rather not. Lol
