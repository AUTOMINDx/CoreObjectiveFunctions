I was curious about ethics in Anthropology and how this is developing. I was wondering if are there any interesting examples of unethical practises and then any examples of how ethics are developed?
I am quite confident that they are many but from all my searches I keep getting results about complaints about how poor a science anthropology is or how this view should be changed instead of examples to read.

Do you have any favourite examples of unethical practices or can you recommend any places/sources where I can find my own examples to read into?

I know they are quite a few regarding colonisation, but what are other events to look at, unless they are any unique or significant ones during colonisation.

Thank you
