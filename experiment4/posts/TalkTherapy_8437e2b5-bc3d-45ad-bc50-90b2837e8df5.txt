My T dropped me until I “get better”
I’ve been seeing my eating disorder therapist 2x weekly for 3 years. I carry several other diagnoses that we work on as well, but primarily that’s why we started working together (she’s an eating disorder specialist). I’ve had chronic anorexia since a young age and I go through phases where I really spiral. She has always been lenient and collaborative with me during these times. I’m in a period where my weight is very low. I’ve still been making weekly improvement and agreeing to all of the guidelines she has set with me in order for her to ethically be able to continue working with me. I’ve been to residential treatment many times and we’ve both agreed that it’s not helpful for me at this point and that I do better trying to work on recovery while also staying in my real life and learning to eat independently. I’ve been on thin ice with her lately but each week we agree that I will do “xyz” until the next session and then we will re-evaluate. I did everything we agreed on and during todays session she said she can no longer work with me until I get better. It was really unexpected. And then she tried to go about the session as normal (checking in about other unrelated things as I’m sobbing). She gave me a date at which I can reach out to her. She said she will take me back once I’m better but that feels hard without support. I’m extremely isolated with very few external supports which she is well aware of. I understand her need for setting boundaries, covering herself, and continuing ethical treatment. I understand and am not upset with her for maintaining those things. I am confused at the suddenness because I had done what we agreed on during Tuesday’s session. Dropping from 2x weekly with one between sessions email for years to nothing feels really confusing to me. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I’m emotionally charged right now so I’m having trouble determining if this made sense for her to do or not.
