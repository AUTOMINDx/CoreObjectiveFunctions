I'm 25, never been promoted or done anything else in my job Dead end?
I realize my age has nothing to do with this but I've been stuck on the same position for nearly 4 years now. I work on customer service, tried to become a manager, failed. Recently I tried again to again become a manager just to not be selected again. The first time I didn't even receive feedback, when I asked my superior he left me on read. Is this normal for anyone else? I've seen friends moving up and other people who perform worse be promoted but not me. I don't know what it is I lack. Anyone been on the same boat?
