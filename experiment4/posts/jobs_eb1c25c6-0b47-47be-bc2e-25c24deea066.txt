Should I give 2 weeks notice?
I started a job a month ago in a small office. The kind of small office they’re “like family”. I was trained for 4 days and left to my own. I’ve heard colleagues talk trash about me. Everyone took a holiday group pic without me and I saw it on the group text chat. Even the girl newer than me was in it. I’m talked down to often and made to feel inferior. 

It’s a huge change from my previous job where they liked me enough to throw a going away party… 

What are your thoughts/opinions?

Edit: Thank you for all the advice and positivity everyone. It was much appreciated.
