I just got told I’m not productive enough when they barely give me tasks
I’ve been at this job for 3 months. I have 5 years of experience in this field, and I know what I’m doing, but of course it still takes time to learn the particular systems and processes used etc, so I know I take longer to do some things. I was under the impression that I could work at my own pace, but apparently I’m actually expected to do everything as fast as possible and then ask for more work. Of course, this expectation was never communicated to me. The other problem is that they’re not assigning me tasks because they think I’m not getting enough done…but then I don’t have much to do so I look unproductive. I’ve never missed a deadline or made a major mistake so I’m not really sure what I’m doing wrong. It seems like they just don’t trust me to do my job, so they don’t give me much, and then they chew me out for not doing enough. I feel like they set me up for failure and then make it my fault.
