AITA for 'ruining' my boyfriend's sister's baby shower?
I (16F) went to my boyfriend (M17) sister's(29F) babyshower 

He invited me because I get along with a lot of his immediate family and thought it'd be a good way to introduce me to some of his extended family (Cousins, aunts and uncles)

I had a bad feeling that I'd get the question any time their out with their boyfriend to a family event 

And I got it, one of his aunts who I didn't know too much came over while I was playing with the younger kids and took me over to where some of the other aunts and my BF's sister was for some 'girl talk'

What she meant was an interrogation about my future life choices 

What university did I plan on going to?
What did I want my career to be? 
My opinions on marriage?

This was more the aunts then the sister, she was pretty silent during it, I answered each one calmly, they seemed to not like the fact that I didn't want to ever be married, even though that's also my boyfriend's opinion 

Then the question came 

'Do you want kids?' 

I said never because I don't want kids, for multiple reasons but I got interrogated about why don't I want kids, would I ever adobt, doesn't my boyfriend want kids 

Then the aunt who pulled me away asked what would happen if I got pregnant by accident, I told them that's very unlikely but if it were I'd most likely abort, they looked like I said I'd kill it with my bare hands, telling me it'd be different if I was actually pregnant and that when I feel a life growing inside me it would be different 

I told them I'm sure that's what they felt but at this moment I don't want a kid and never want a kid, so that is what I would do

When I went back outside I told my BF what happened and went to play hide and seek with the little kids and everything was fine but when we came back in to eat 

My BF's aunt asked 'I thought you didn't want kids' I reinforced that I didn't and she brought up that I was really good with the kids at the party, I explained wanting kids and being good with kids are two different things 

She then told my BF that I need to leave and I ruined the party because of my opinions and what I said while she was 'making conversation' 

My BF said we'd both leave since his aunt was out of line

A couple days later his dad told us that his Aunt never wants to see me again and disapproves of me being with my BF

So AITA for stating my views on a topic I was asked about?

Edits: I just wanted to clear up and add in some things 

It's very common to ask 16 year olds about Uni and careers because it's a big focus in schools and at 16 you're already in your first year of college

16 is the legal age of consent 

Culture has been asked alot, both me and BF were born and raised in Britian but I was raised with German culture due to my dad being German and he was raised with Spanish culture because his dad's side is Spanish

I reached out to my Bf's sister (the mother to be) and apologised if I made her uncomfortable or ruined her party, she said she didn't blame me and the aunt has done this interrogation to many spouses and I'm helping my BF's dad plan a baby shower for her, it's a little smaller but it's to make up for the drama 

My BF's dad did tell me about his aunt not liking me but said he doesn't care what she thinks

Update: 

Holy shit, I didn't expect this to blow up so much, thank you so much for the support and suggestions on how to handle this better if it happens again, as well as some very funny insults and come backs that made me laugh a little, thank you for those who respectfully understood my choices even if they don't align with their own and not undermining my choices
