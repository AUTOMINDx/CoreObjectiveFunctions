People don’t understand trauma
People think that trauma is like a headache or a broken bone. You just “go to a therapist” and you fix it. 

Unfortunately that’s not 100% the case. There are real feelings involved. Sometimes we just need a lot of love- and therapy really won’t cut it. 

People don’t understand that a traumatic state is a feeling… and a strong one. It’s not something you can always take predetermined steps to fix. Sometimes therapy won’t help if the person is lacking love in their life, for example.
