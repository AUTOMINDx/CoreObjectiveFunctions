AITA for buying a door to my son behind my husband's back?
For those who might have been confused; my(35f) husband (46M) believes that until he is 18, our son(M14) shouldn't conceal his room as he is under our care. This has been one of the things straining our relationship lately, as I think that a teen should have some freedom, maybe not completely out of our sight, but you know a door at least, but my husband keeps insisting on him having almost no freedom at all. Whenever I bring up the door thing, he just shuts me down with "this is what it'll take him to be a man" and "this is how I was raised"

So both my son's birthday and Christmas are coming up, and I decided that he should finally have a door to his room. So, I went behind my husband's back and bought a new door and hurried it to be installed while they were both away. When my son came from school he was incredibly delighted, but my husband didn't receive the news so well.

He told me that this is not the kind of decision that I should be making by myself and that I disrespected his authority, and now he is refusing to even sleep in the same bed as me. I've been wondering if this should have been a conversation rather then me disrespecting his wishes.

So am I the asshole for going behind my husband's back to get a door for my kid?
