Has 2021 just been a really off year or is it just me?
I know that 2020 was really weird for a lot of people with the pandemic and stuff, but I’ve really felt like 2021 has been way worse than 2020. Adjusting to a more “normal” life has been weird since my graduation, and it feels like one day Covid cases are going down and the next all of a sudden a new variant comes or Covid cases are going up but no one seems to care (at least in the new state I moved to). It just has been feeling so weird rather than 2020. I’ve heard a lot of people say that in 2020 it was weird because the pandemic was starting. For me actually, the being at home option wasn’t putting so much stress. But the adjustment to actually go outside and do “normal” things like go to work in person, it’s been way worse for me at least. Anyone else?
