What citation format do you use and why?
My question is simple, which citation format do your prefer using and why? Also, if possible, tell me where you study.

Example -

Citation: APA and ChicagoStudying at: US, Germany

I am torn between APA and Chicago style, but I know the AAA has there own format tweaks as well. My  faculty here is also pretty torn between the two. One professor uses MLA, but I don't know why.

I like Chicago for its footnotes, however, APA works more streamlined for me and my writing. 

Thanks again!
