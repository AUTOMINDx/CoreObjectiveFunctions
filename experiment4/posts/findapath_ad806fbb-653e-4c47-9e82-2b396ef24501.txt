Tired of working shit dead-end jobs and finally ready to work towards a career
Relevant info: 27 years old. Econ degree. Since graduating, I’ve only worked two dead-end data entry jobs in fields I have absolutely no interest in.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve operated under the mindset of “there’s enough time left for me to get my shit together and start living tomorrow.” Well, the tomorrows have been passing faster and faster, and I’ve yet to get a foothold on a career. I’ve finally come to accept that most of my “dream jobs” are completely inaccessible to me due to the decades of inertia. So I’m finally ready to give up on the idea of infinite potential, and start working towards what is possible. 

I think the best path for me is data science. Math, logic, and reasoning skills have always come easy to me (I feel sick for typing that out), and it seems like if I could just get a foot in the door, I could really flourish. Retuning to school isn’t feasible for me at the moment, so I’m going to work on certifications in Excel, SQL, R, Python, etc. I took a rough course in SQL a few years ago, and understood most of it, so I think I can handle it. Then I hope to land an entry-level analyst job, and take it from there.

I guess my question is: for those of you who finally stopped wasting time and started carving out a career: how did you do it? What was it like going from work you were apathetic towards to a field you wanted to be in?
