When you trusted that your doctor's looked over your allergies before surgery
But apparently they didn't and so they used the glue on top of your stitches, so on top of regular soreness from surgery, the regular flare you end up having because of surgery, you also have blisters because of the glue/adhesive. 😭

I usually remind nurses and the surgeon beforehand but my surgery was so early a couple of days ago and they (the nurses) had gone over my allergies with me, so I didn't think I needed to bring it up again. 🤦🏻‍♀️
