Met my bestfriend after almost 3 years
Im so happy today
I just got back home
She came back after almost 3 years and we haven't been in touch in these past years because my depression is fucked up and i tend to forget texting people but we had fun today
We automatically clicked again and we didn't feel AWKWARD at all 
I feel alive, that's it
My friends are worth living for
We both live in different countries, but were born in the same country, but she moved away 

I regret not being in touch with her but we are good. 
that's it
I'm not going to bed upset tonight, ig 
Thanks for reading
