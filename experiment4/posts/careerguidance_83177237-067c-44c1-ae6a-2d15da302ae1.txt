Anyone else ever feel bored and repetitive by life or their job? How do you break up the monotony?
Starting to feel like life gets kind of boring. Work 5x days a week. Rest and relax 2 days to recharge and then repeat. While I don't mind, it almost leaves no time to do anything else. I guess that's why vacation time and the holidays are so important, since they're yur only time you can really take a load off and not think about work. Hard to do that when you get off work at 5 PM, have to worry about dinner and then go back to work the next day. Anyone else feeling the same?
