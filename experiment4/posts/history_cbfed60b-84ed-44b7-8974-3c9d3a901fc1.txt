Was the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere brutal to island natives of the Dutch East Indies?
Asked on ask a historian. but I thought I'd start a discussion while I wait a maybe answer there.

I'm reading the book My life with the samurai: how I survived Japanese death camps by Anthony Cowling. It's mostly about the authors experience first hand as a POW. He spent time as a POW in Java, Ceram, Buru, and Celebes. I was aware of the brutal treatment POWs recived. I was however, supprised by the treatment described of the native vilages on the islands. He witnessed beatings, forced labour, torture games, and theft of their food. Near the end he even reports poorly treated villages being bombed out of existence by Japanese airplanes. Was the greater East Asia Co-prosperity sphear as brutal to natives in the Dutch East Indies, as its claimed in the book?

If it helps, the notorious prison guards at Anthony's main camp were nick named Blood and slime. There was even a movie about the pair staring John Wayne.
