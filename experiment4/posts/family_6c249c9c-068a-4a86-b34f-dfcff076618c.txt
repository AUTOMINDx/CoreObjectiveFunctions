Is taking someone to a restaurant they enjoy considered a good Christmas gift or not?
My grandmother is very important to me. At christmas, when i was a kid, she always gave really good gifts. Now that i'm an adult and have my own money, i wanted to get her a good gift.

But i didn't really know what to buy her. I thought i'd take her to a restaurant she really enjoys, Cracker Barrel. I thought it'd be nice since nobody else in the family likes eating there.

Is this a good gift or is it considered to be cheap and tacky?
