I wanted to share for no reason
So I was 15, it was the end of 9th grade and it was the last day of school. There was a graduation party because we had just finished middle school. I, of course, had shown up wearing a suit. I’m a girl. And there was a whole ceremony and stuff and then there was an after party at a kids club or something.

I’m not a party person so I asked my dad to pick me up, and we went to a nearby bakery to celebrate the graduation together before heading home.

At some point I brought it up and said “I think I like girls” and he responded with “ok, I love you no matter what and this won’t change that” and then we ate out pastries and went home.

So I came out at 15 wearing a suit, I don’t get to talk about this story much, so here ya go. :)
