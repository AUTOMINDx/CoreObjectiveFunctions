Forgive yourself for the stupid things you did and endured because you genuinely liked someone
Hit me today a little bit hard because someone contacted me  after the third round of ghosting (the audacity though) and it made me look with much more objective eyes at my chat history with her and I can only cringe at it. With the benefit of a doubt I gave her I could have declared Hitler innocent in a jury trial ...it is unbelievable.

How much bullshit I ate just because I liked her even though in retrospect it is clear she never did and just used me as an attention booster whenever she felt lonely or needed something to cheer her up.

Where was this anger that was rushing through me but I realized I am more angry at myself that I did not take care better of myself. If a friend would have send me this chat history I would have dragged him physically away from this and had one intervention after another.

I try to forgive myself that I have ever allowed someone to treat me like that and you should do to.
