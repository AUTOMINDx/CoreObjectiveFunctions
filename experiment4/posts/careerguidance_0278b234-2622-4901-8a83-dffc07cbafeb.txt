Is anyone ashamed of working in retail?
I’ve been working in retail for nearly 5 years and though I’m not directly involved in selling goods or merchandise, since I work in a telecommunications company, I get severe anxiety from the fact that the job is totally opposed to my work preferences. 

I never wanted to work in retail and rather aspired for a dignified white color job with a decent pay. Unfortunately, I got here due to financial circumstances since I had too many dependents, and now it has plunged me into a hole that is very difficult to get out from. 

My school friends were really smart and most of them graduated from top schools and got amazing jobs. They are well settled in their lives and career while I’m grinding my ass earning mediocre wage. I feel pathetic about myself. And I don’t know what would happen to me if anyone I know would see me. 

Everyday is becoming heavier and my depression is getting worse. My job is controlling my life to a significant degree. I’m applying daily to other jobs but seldom get any feedback. I feel like I have lost a huge part of my dignity and I crave to do something more meaningful and satisfying.
