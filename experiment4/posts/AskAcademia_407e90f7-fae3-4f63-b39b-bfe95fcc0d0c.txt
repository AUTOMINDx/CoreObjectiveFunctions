Migrate from Mendeley to Zotero?
I been using Mendeley for several years. I use it for reading and annotating PDF documents and also as reference manager in word. 

I am getting increasingly annoyed with Mendeley because the link to ms word regularly breaks and requires a restart of word and an uninstall+reinstall of the extension to work. 

I'm now reading that most people here recommend zotero and that Mendeley was built from zotero. So maybe I should bite the bullet and switch? How would I in that case go about moving my several gb database from Mendeley to zotero? Any advice here. 

Thanks.
