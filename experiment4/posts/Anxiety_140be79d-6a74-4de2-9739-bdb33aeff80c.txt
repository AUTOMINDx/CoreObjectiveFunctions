Too scared to even comment on Reddit
I keep deleting all my comments because I’m worried they’re not funny enough or people won’t like them or I got there too late. It’s fucking Reddit, everybody is a loser, yet I’m still worried to sound like one. Really sick of overthinking all this stuff, I just wish I could enjoy myself for a bit and get involved with something?

Edit: sorry haha I don’t really know how to respond to these comments either but I really do appreciate it! I’m taking advice and I hope we all improve on this ❤️
