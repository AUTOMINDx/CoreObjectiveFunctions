[DC comics] How is Batman/Bruce not severely injured or crippled from all the injuries he's sustained?? He's an impressive human specimen but he's still supposed to be baseline human right ? Like after enough injury no matter how well It healed he should've been slowed way down in just his
first few years as the human body can literally only take so much ,  alot of his body should be stiff and hard to move , his range of motion should be hampered and he shouldn't be able to nearly as much after all the injuries he's sustained
