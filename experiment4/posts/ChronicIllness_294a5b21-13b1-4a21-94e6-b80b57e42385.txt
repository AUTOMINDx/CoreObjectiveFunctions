I did it!
Nobody will understand as well as you guys do. My chronic health conditions hit about the time I started uni. Of course this meant I didn't get very far and have been struggling with my health since. I am in my 40s now. This fall I started taking classes part time at the local community college in the hopes that someday I may get a degree that will keep me employable. It was a long semester, too much to juggle, and I got really sick during it, to the point I spent a couple of weeks in the hospital. Last week was finals, today my grades were posted. I managed to get an A in everything I took. I can't even begin to express what it means, but I know you guys will understand. 

I may not have a roof over my head come January thanks to my health, but I got through my semester of classes!
