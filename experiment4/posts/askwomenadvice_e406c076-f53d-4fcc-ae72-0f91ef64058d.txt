terrified to buy my partner jewlery, want to show my affection but worried she may hate it and I'll have wasted lots of money
Hi Reddit,

  I (M) want to buy my partner (F 33) a nice ring for a Xmas present but cannot decide if this is the right thing to do.  It's an expensive gift  ($1,100-1,500 USD) and am going in circles trying to decide if she will like this or its a stupid idea.

  I havent bought her any jewelry since we were married many years ago.  She has not signaled she would like this, I just want to do something nice and a little showy since we are more established in our careers, plus growing family, getting thru the pandemic etc.  

What if she hates the ring design that I purchased? (not refundable since its a custom piece)  Am I doing the right thing here? Any help is appreciated
