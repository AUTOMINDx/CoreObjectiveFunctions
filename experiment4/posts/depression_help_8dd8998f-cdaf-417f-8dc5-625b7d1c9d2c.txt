I can't stop lashing out and I need advice.
I don't know how to start this so i will just get to the point.

I have been depressed since I was 12 and i have grown to know and recognise my symptoms pretty easily as they are happening. I know I generally experience Low mood, self harm; excessive sleeping, random bursts of tears, the general stuff but for the past year i have not been able to in anyway control my emotions and lately (about the past 4 months) I've been experiencing high volumes of just uncontrollable anger.

The problem with this is i've never really been angry, I've been annoyed/irritated but never angry. It's terrifying, I don't know what to do, I'm constantly snapping at my partner, I've yelled at people on the street and i'm actively trying to get people to hit me, I don't understand why though.

(i'm not sure if this would be important to mention but i haven't been able to self harm for a while as my partner has banned shaving razors in our home and anything sharp has been hidden.)
