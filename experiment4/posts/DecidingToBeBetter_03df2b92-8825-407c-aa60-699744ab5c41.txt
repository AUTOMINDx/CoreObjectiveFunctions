I'm spending Christmas alone...it is today that I want to turn this ship around
I think today all of the problems in my life finally came to a head, mentally. My mom (someone I was *unhealthily* close to) died of cancer four months ago. I got promoted working for a boss who sexually harasses me. I suffered some health conditions. Started drinking a ton. Got a DUI in October. Broke up with my boyfriend a few weeks later, although he seems to be happy with the decision (I tried reaching out a few times and he didn't respond). Stopped completely working on school.

 I'm not close with my dad and brother, but they are struggling in their own way, although it seems they are capable of moving on in their life and taking the bull by the horns. While I just only feel like drinking by myself and watching King of the Hill after work, falling asleep drunkenly, and repeating. 

Today is Christmas, and my brother and dad went out to different family member's houses. I am too sad to go out anywhere, and I don't like spending time with my brother and dad because it reminds me that my mom is missing. 

So it's 7:30 AM on Christmas, and all I want to do is crack open a beer and watch TV. It is today I realize how fucked my life is. And I know my mom wants better of me. 

If you could give me one change to make that you just KNOW would make me happier, please, please, help me out. Merry Christmas, happy holidays, happy new year, may love and peace abound for all of you. I'm ready to change.
