Morning anxiety is destroying my life.
For starters, let’s get into what I am already doing to take charge of my mental health…

I am in weekly therapy with an amazing woman who I’ve been seeing for about 9 months. I am diagnosed with GAD and depression, prescribed 75mg Effexor, 30mg of Celexa, and .25mg Ativan as needed. I rarely, if ever, use the Ativan because it does NOT work at all. Not in the slightest, even when I take a full mg. My PCP refuses to prescribe me a higher dose because Ativan is very addictive, fair enough. I don’t smoke or drink. I have been trying to find a psychiatrist, but we all know how that goes. I meditate, journal, do breath work, and all of that good stuff. 

For the past 3 weeks I have panic attacks every single morning as soon as I am semi- conscious and still in bed. The best I can do is close my eyes and curl up into a ball until it passes. I am hyperventilating, shaking, and extremely nauseous. It sets the tone for the rest of my day where I have lingering anxiety, jittery, and overall feel lousy. Everything scares me. I can’t get a single night of solid sleep because I always have a never ending sense of doom and fear. I’ve dropped 15lbs during this time because I just can’t eat. 

I am absolutely losing my mind. I’m so scared that if I don’t get this under control soon, I’ll get to a point where I’ll have a break down and hurt myself. I’m so scared of this feeling every morning, I dread being conscious because all I feel is anxiety. 

What can I do to get a hold of this morning anxiety? The rise in cortisol is killing me.
