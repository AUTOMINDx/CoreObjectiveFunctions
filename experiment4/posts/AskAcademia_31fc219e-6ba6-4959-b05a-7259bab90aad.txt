Anyone actually happy with their PhD experience?
Bonus points if you're in a scientific discipline. I'm obtaining my Masters currently in ecology and have been entertaining the thought of obtaining a PhD. I just look at all of the jobs available in my area for a Masters degree and, while I love field work a lot more than lab work, all of these positions seem like they would lack intellectual stimulation. 

I do not directly know what I want to do for a career, though I have been entertaining the thought of becoming a professor or going into some sort of conservation research. I would like to work for (roughly, maybe longer) 2-3 years before pursuing a PhD, if that's what I end up deciding to do. 

However, I see so many posts on here that are overwhelmingly negative regarding PhD work. These experiences have been very illuminating to me in what to watch out for and what hardships I might experience. But I would love to also weigh what the benefits have been for people who are in the process of achieving their PhD or have already done so.
