does anyone else sometimes trigger themselves with their own thoughts?
i’ve caught myself doing this a few times and i don’t know why! the feeling following getting triggered is something i work hard to stay away from but sometimes when i’m not doing my best i find myself doing it to myself. sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, just wanted to know if anyone can relate or if this is a shared experience. 

(also- i’m new to this reddit or subreddit ((im not sure what they’re actually called)) and wasn’t sure what to post flair this as so i’m sorry if i labeled it wrong!)
