How do you exercise when you hate exercise?
I want to incorporate exercise into my daily routine. I hear all the time how much it improves people’s lives, sharpens their minds, help them sleep better at night, etc!

Problem is… I have hated almost every form of exercise I have ever tried. I found workouts to be incredibly boring, and I really really dislike playing sports. Like genuinely I would rather tear my own hair out than go for a jog or play basketball. 

I want to find a way to make exercise something I won’t just absolutely dread, and preferably without spending too much money (if possible). 

Any and all tips, suggestions, and advice are welcome!
