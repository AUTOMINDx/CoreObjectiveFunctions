is this normal?
I have had a long medical history since i was a teenager, including a intense emergency surgery that disrupted my life for a while and two knee reconstructions. In addition to this, both of my parents are chronically ill with one having heart disease and the other crohn’s disease and both having a cancer diagnosis within the past two years. i’ve grown up watching my father undergo intensive surgery and my mother as well. I’ve been in therapy and processed all of this fairly well but tonight I was watching a sitcom and one of the characters had to undergo surgery. I started to panic, I felt the same fear i have felt a million times both for myself and others and i couldn’t control it. I have never felt this before in this context and I don’t know why it just happened now. I deal with general anxiety but i’ve never had a post traumatic response like this before.
