Cortisol, the main stress hormone, is often associated with anxiety. Cortisol is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it constricts blood vessels, and could lead to less blood flow to the brain. Cortisol is associated with reduced brain function, learning and memory issues, balance issues, etc.
The main and virtually only significant way to reduce cortisol is through exercise. 

Light exercise lowers cortisol. For example, walking. 

Moderate to high intensity exercise raises cortisol. For example, sprinting. 

Light exercise may help.

Edit: Yoga is known to significantly reduce cortisol, and anxiety, and help with a load of other things. I'm going to start doing yoga tomorrow.
