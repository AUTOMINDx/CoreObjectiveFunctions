Why is Susan B. Anthony more well known than Elizabeth Cady Stanton?
It seems they both played active roles in the womenâ€™s suffrage movement in the second half of the 19th century, so why is Anthony the name that comes to mind instead of both women?  From what I understand, they both had significant contribution, especially the Seneca Falls Convention / Declaration of the Sentiments.  Does anyone have an inkling as to why Anthony is more well known, despite the women making a great team together?
