I got so much love from this community - more than my parents / family
I recently posted about my struggle with anger, and i have received such wonderful and helpful insights and ways of processing.

I saw so many people making an effort to help, and at one point i cried reading it, with the realisation that i am getting so much more validation, love, acceptance and support from strangers in similar struggles than i ever did from my parents

thank you and hugs to you all
