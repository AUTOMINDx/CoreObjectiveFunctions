[NJ] Boss sends questionable email regarding masks and fascism
\[NJ\] Yesterday, a Corporate email reinforcing some masking requirements for those working in our office was sent out.  Typical corporate stuff indicating that masks are required whenever you are not at your desk (and even if just standing at your desk), masks with valves are no longer permitted, etc.  A little overkill in my personal opinion, but nothing earth shattering.  About 5 minutes after this email was sent, our supervisor sends a department wide email with a screenshot of a page from Wikipedia.  Title of the email was something about 'science', with a screenshot of a page related to a social experiment in the late 1960s that showed how the German people were able to ignore the Holocaust.  A number of passages in the screenshot are highlighted that essentially try to compare how the corporate mask policies mimic the approaches taken in the experiment to get people to accept fascism/Nazism. 

My question boils down to whether this is something that has risen to the level of being reportable to HR, or am I (and some other co-workers) overreacting?
