My dad took me to a chiropractor and I’m super skeptic

So my dad took me to a chiropractor a week ago to check some muscle pain and allergies I have, and it was just so incredibly weird. So basically the chiropractor pushed my legs in a very weird way and told me that my legs yielded because I had some muscles “deactivated” or something like that. Then he diagnosed that essentially I was getting too much exposure to “unwanted chemicals” in my body like normal toothpaste for some reason? He held toothpaste with like a magnet on my belly and my leg yielded more? (I am even fairly certain he used more strength to push that time). Then he told me to hop in a weird way and all of a sudden my leg was fine (no longer yielded). He then told me to stop using normal toothpaste and normal deodorant and to eat supplements after my meals to “counteract” toxicity. Is this legit, am I crazy to be skeptic, or should I never return with that chiropractor?
