too scared to fully come out...
i have recently posted in another subreddit that im struggling with my sexuality. i have more of a history with dating men than I do women (but I have dated women &amp; pursued them sexually) 
I've identified as pansexual since i was 20. I'm 25. but for the past month prior to my breakup with my cis, straight male ex ive dreamed about &amp; imagined myself with women. i want them romantically, physically, emotionally, etc. more than I do men. i see myself with a woman. 
i got told about *comphet* and things in the masterdoc made SO MUCH SINCE. FOR ME. rang many bells. so i dove into YouTube last night and watched many videos with titles like "signs that you might be a lesbian" and those signals hit me hard to the point that I started crying. i also took some quizzes (unnecessary maybe but for some reason I thought I'd find my answer there) and all 10 I took said I am a lesbian. so it's been made very clear to me. but im super scared to tell my mother, even my ex who's been talking about getting back together. 

my mom invalidated me when I was 16 and I told her I was bi saying "it's just a phase" 
and my ex is manipulative and emotionally ab*sive dragging me online for kissing my female friend when we weren't together, accusing me of cheating. im not only scared of telling then but im also scared of myself. 
does this make sense at all?
