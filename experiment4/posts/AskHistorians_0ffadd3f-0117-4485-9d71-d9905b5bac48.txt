How did people come to a consensus about what crystals “do”?(I’m asking about the history of people believing in this, not about the crystals themselves)
I’m not trying to stir things up about crystals and peoples’s faith, I’m just wondering how people in the west came to an agreement about these things.  I could understand if it was something like  “Traditional Han culture associated xxxxx with xxxx”

Or “in Ancient Rome, xxxx was believed to xxxx” 

But there seems to be a pretty strong consensus that certain crystals do certain things.  That rose quarts is “unconditional love”, for example.  

Did one person decide that? Does it stem from one particular faith?
