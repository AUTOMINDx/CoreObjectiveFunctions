Recent graduate terrified of failure, how do I get past this?
Hi everyone,

I've recently graduated with my bachelor's degree in sociology/urban planning, and I have absolutely no clue what to do job-wise.  I'm pretty terrified of the whole application/interview process, but I'm even more scared of actually getting a job and then screwing up so badly that I have to leave the position.  It doesn't help that I am physically disabled and, in all likelihood, will have to find a remote job.

I have just about zero experience.  I had a job as a cashier for about four hours a few years back, but I was so anxious that the manager had to sit me down and ask if I thought I could continue. I said no and left.  So with that in the back of my mind, I'm just terrified of something similar happening.

Does anyone else have any experience dealing with this fear and overcoming it?  At this point I've almost given up looking for jobs because everything is so overwhelming.  I could really use some advice. :(

Thanks for reading and I apologize if I rambled a bit. Any help at all is greatly appreciated.
