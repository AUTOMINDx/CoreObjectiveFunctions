[meta] "Am I overreacting?" "Am I the asshole?" "Is this okay?" don't ask these moral judgment (yes/no questions about the past) questions here. Likewise, absolutely no questions around sexual situations involving anyone under 18. See this thread for what to do instead for both of these.
#On the first topic: 

The subreddit is a place for people to ask for advice on what to do next. I know it sounds dumb, but questions like "Is this normal?", "Am I wrong", "Am I an asshole", "Is this fair" or basically any questions asking about whether *something that happened in the past* was okay... these aren't requesting advice on what to do next, so they're not appropriate for the subreddit. 

Instead, posts should ask questions like 

* "what should I do next?" or 

* "how do I do this?" or 

* "how can I fix this?" etc.

If you have a question around something you *think* you want to do but aren't sure if it's a good idea, instead of asking (for instance) "is this a good idea" or "would I be the asshole," try to encourage depth, like "I'm thinking about doing this. What do you think I should do here?" That way you'll get better answers than just a 'yes' or 'no.' Or at the very least, people might tell you why you should do the thing you already have in mind.

We're currently automatically removing variations of the following (these phrases aren't all exact):

&gt; "Is this normal?", "Am I wrong", "Is it wrong", "Am I the asshole", "Am I in the wrong", "Would I be an asshole", "Would I be the asshole", "AITA", "WIBTA", "Should I have done", "Who's right here", "Was I wrong", "Should I have to", "Am I overreacting", "am I justified", "is  reasonable", "Am I at fault", "Was it irresponsible for", "am I out of line", "is this a big deal", "Isn't that fucked up?", "Am I the bad one", "Am I being too sensitive", "Is it weird", "Am I right"

So hopefully this gives you an idea of what shouldn't be posted here. If your question is a yes/no question about something that happened in the past (like those are), change your question.

#On the second topic: 

if you have a question about any sexual situations involving minors (anyone under 18 for the purposes of this subreddit; it doesn't matter what your local laws say), even concerns around potential grooming, please don't post them here. 

If you're a minor and have questions involving sexual topics, consider reaching out to either your parents or sex education/family life resources in your school on these topics, or if you're not comfortable, consider a resource such as:

* [Scarleteen](https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships)

If you're a minor or know of a minor with sexual or potentially sexual interactions with an adult, instead of submitting here, please speak with a teacher, therapist, counselor, social worker, or other mandatory reporter or appropriate adult with your concerns and absolutely make use of the following resources:

* [Darkness to Light: a child sex abuse prevention resource.](https://www.d2l.org/get-help/reporting/)

* [A confidential hotline to a trained advisor who can help you navigate this](https://www.childhelp.org/childhelp-hotline/)

* [International Resources](https://www.ecpat.org/resources)

It's safe to say that no one here on this subreddit is professionally, legally, or ethically qualified to give advice on these topics, so we're deferring to expert resources and hotlines like the ones above. 

## When reporting these, feel free to report these posts with the sexualization of minors option in the report list, as it's being enforced under that Reddit content rule.

We owe a deeper rules reminder soon, but the above should cover the most pressing issues.
