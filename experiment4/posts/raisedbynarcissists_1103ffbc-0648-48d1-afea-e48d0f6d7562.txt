After 49 years of verbal abuse, bullying, and threatening, I kicked my dad out of my life yesterday. Independence Day will always be November 30, and it’s a day to celebrate! Quietly, though. Fireworks scare my dogs 😂
My father has fucked up my life, but always acted like it was me being too sensitive, too reactive and basically emotionally unstable because I “couldn’t take a joke.” I spent my entire life believing I was worthless. After 30 years of therapy, I am choosing myself. He is now listed as Fucking Asshole in my phone, though I have blocked him in every conceivable way. 

I just got a whole new life, and I’m so excited! Thanks for your support Reddit. ❤️

EDIT: r/raisedbynarcissists  is a great source of info and support!

EDIT 2: WOW!! I am overwhelmed by all of your kind words and encouragement. Hugs to you all!!!❤️❤️❤️

UPDATE: things have gotten worse, and better since Independence Day. I realized that once I remove my abusive, narcissist father from the equation, I still have my enabling, abusive mother and sister to deal with. Long story short-I’m moving away from here as soon as possible. I am disabled and suffer financial abuse, though my family will be quick to deny it. After all, i live in a $400,000 house rent free.  I am looking into a job in my field several hours away. It would mean letting go of my disability payments which is scary but I can’t take this anymore. I’m tired of begging for $20 so I can eat when my parents just spent about 1 million in cash on real estate. I just want out, completely, and to be done with these people. Basically, I’m slowly selling stuff so I can move sometime soon. So, things are worse in the sense that I now realize how sick my family really is. But that’s also the good thing 😊
