my parents don't take me seriously
I'm currently 14. I've been seeing and hearing things that aren't there. it mostly started when I was about 10. I used to hear clocks ticking and phones ringing and then I used to realize that there was no clock in the place or no phone ringing. these "hallucinations" have grown even stronger with the years. I see shadow figures, and hear whispers. sometimes i hear someone shouting very loudly in my ears,  I'm incapable of stopping it and my head starts to ache (so I usually start to listen to very loud and heavy music). I also feel like I'm being spied on most of the time. it's like a voice in my head telling me to go and check the doors and windows. and its almost impossible to resist, I know its not real but I still want to check to make sure. 
this makes it incredibly difficult to focus on anything. I've literally studied nothing in the past two months. it something gets so out of hand that I even think of committing suicide...
I told my mom about the clock ticking and phone ringing thing (because I thought telling her about shadow people, whispers and feelings of being watched might make her think I'm possessed or something lol). she's telling me to stop acting stupid and making a fuss and stuff...
I can't tell my dad because he's very narcissistic and an active alcoholic. 
I don't know why but I think about ending my life a lot these days... I really can't find a way out of my head. so I came here to look for solutions. can someone tell me what to do?
