Aspects, planets and houses you usually associate more with dark people, who love darkness and taboos?
For me:
 1. Moon square or conjunct pluto.



 2. Scorpio moon. 



3. Capricorn rising / sun / moon


 4. Scorpio rising / sun 


5. Mars aspect pluto 


6. Sun aspect pluto.



 7. Sun, moon and mars in 8th house



 8. Aquarius sun / moon



 9. Aries moon 




10. Sun or moon in 12th house


Scorpio(pluto) lives in darkness, capricorn(saturn) is the dark.
Capricorn is a goat, the devil is personified with a goat's head. Pluto and saturn aspects are darkness, and also uranus and mars.
