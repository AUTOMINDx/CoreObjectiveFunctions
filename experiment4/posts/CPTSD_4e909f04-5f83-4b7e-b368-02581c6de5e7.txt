DAE think their trauma influenced their physical appearance?
You know how the body keeps the score? I feel like the stress twisted my body to look different. 

I’m 24 but I already have frown lines I think due to constantly feeling dirty and disgusted by myself and everything that I’ve always been wincing or grimacing or clenching my jaw. I feel like my need to hide away influenced my slouchy shoulders and I wanted to hide my breasts so they never really developed. Now that I’m doing a lot of body work I’m able to see what my body would have been without these emotions I tried so hard to keep shut. I feel a bit vulnerable now that my breasts are finally developing but it feels like I’m healing physically. I’m trying hard to not be disgusted by my feminine body. Seeing my hips become wider as I learn to relax my pelvic region. It’s just really overwhelming. I want to fix my face the most cause I just feel it contort from all the internal pain but it’s really hard to teach the muscles it’s ok to relax and I don’t need to frown all the time to avoid pain.

Edit: I can also feel the difference in how my body is now carrying extra weight. I felt it so tight in my stomach now it seems to be spreading more evenly out. I’m wondering if this is also helping my metabolism with finally feeling ok to “rest and digest.” Also, if anyone has any good recommendations for facial messages I’d really love that.
