15 weeks pregnant - Baby has confirmed Trisomy 21 - Impressions of most recent ultrasound?
32 F, first pregnancy, 15 weeks, height: 5’5”, weight: 115 lbs, ethnicity: caucasian. I am in Canada.

Here is the ultrasound we had today : https://imgur.com/a/H9qw3ew

At 12 weeks the baby was diagnosed with a 9.3 mm cystic hygroma (which is what initiated further testing and ultimately provided us with a diagnosis). The scan today (at 15 weeks) was arranged by our genetic counsellor and geneticist to help give us a better idea of the baby’s health (i.e., reassess the cystic hygroma, look at the baby’s anatomy, etc.). A report will be sent to my genetic counsellor and she is supposed to call me on Monday. Alas, my husband and I are impatient people...so here we are...

I can see that the cystic hygroma is still there (no surprise),  but I also noticed another “bump” on the baby’s actual neck. Am I imagining this? Also, my husband and I are concerned about the brain. It looks incomplete for lack of a better term. Specially the front part of the brain - it just seems smaller than what I am used to seeing in other people’s 15 week ultrasounds. Finally, I notice a black spot on the part of the brain that we can see. My understanding is that black spots mean fluid. Am I seeing things correctly?

If anyone is willing, you can give it to us straight. We are aware that this is a high risk pregnancy and that the baby isn't doing well. I've been told that I may miscarry at any point. 

Thank you in advance kind doctors of Reddit!
