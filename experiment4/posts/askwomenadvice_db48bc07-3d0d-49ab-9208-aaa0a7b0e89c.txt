How to be more feminine? I have been a tomboy my entire life
How to be more feminine?

Hello women of Reddit :) 
I am here today in need of help being more feminine. I’ve always been a ‘tomboy’, which was fine and dandy as a kid, but now that I am a grown woman (26) with a two year old I find myself struggling to dress appropriately and feel ‘pretty’. I see women all the time with perfect hair and makeup, they always smell nice and look nice and carry themselves well, and I just do not know how to do these things? I’d like to get my hair done, nails done, and dress and carry myself in a more feminine vs masculine way (I wear sweats, big t shirts, unbrushed hair), but I do not know where or how to start. I barely know how to dress myself lmao 
I guess in short, 
I’m looking for Fashion advise
Hair advise
Beauty advise 
And hygiene advise 
Really any tips you’d like to throw my way to help!
