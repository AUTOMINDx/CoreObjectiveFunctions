Update: Should I (33M) invite my son (18M) to thanksgiving?
Well I got over my fear and invited my son in the end. I appreciate the encouragement. Really helped to just push past the nerves and ask him if he wanted to spend thanksgiving. But gave him the option if he’d like it to be with my whole family, some of them or maybe just us. He didn’t give me a straight answer and told me to give him a few days to reply while he thinks about it. In the end he said he wasn’t ready yet to meet others in my family.

This whole year has already come with so many changes in his life and he’s just not sure he can handle so many more right now. Which I understand. We spent thanksgiving just me and him and I loved it. My son was kind of down which makes sense with this being his first holiday w/o his grandparents. He got in a better mood after and we were able to talk more. I cherished this time with him. It’s hard not to look at him sometimes in awe. How much another person can look so much like you and have a whole personality of their own. I told my son I loved him when he left and he smiled. He was open to meeting my mom a couple days ago. She tried hard not to cry but it was still very emotional. He’s opening up little by little and that’s something. I wanna give my son all the space he needs
