I graduated college with engineering job offers and via false promises I ended up choosing the worst option.
This is just asking for advice but last year during covid I had to apply to job and interview via zoom. After internships I had two offers and via an online career fair I had another set of two. So I had 4 offers (which was fantastic because I thought I was screwed be of my graduation timing). 

One of the offers promised good work life balance and after a summer of hell at a manufacturing company I took that offer over another that was a good company, location, and hours but very low pay. It seemed like a good choice. The location sucked but the pay was decent and the hours were said to be manageable even on Glassdoor and the by the employees. 

I’m one year in an it’s been hell. I’m constantly working 60+ hours and basically on call. The people I spoke to when interviewing were the process team and I work I hardware. I didn’t know but, I spoke to the ones that have good hours while everyone that’s my actual colleagues work insane hours to. 

I was told a bold face lie. And via that lie I moved states, reneged on an offer from my internship company (the one with good everything but low pay). I basically burned a bridge and at the end if you divide up the pay by how much I work. The per dollar offer was the same. 

Out of all 4 offers this on was the worst choice. Bad location. Bad hours. No overtime. And so worst pay if you factor in the hours worked. 

I’m planning on leaving but, how do I avoid this in the future?
