Is there REALLY a labor shortage?
I've been hearing about how there is a labor shortage for at least 6 months now. Whether it's the news, discussions with a friend who is a technical recruiter, etc. With that I decided it might not be a bad time to send out some applications and see if I get any bites. I've probably applied to about 30 positions in the last six months and no real interest. Well the other day after applying to a position listed on Indeed I pull up my applied job to read my wife the job description and I noticed the amount of applications was listed. 160-170 TOTAL. I start scrolling through and looking at a few other jobs and every position had over 100 applicants.

So is there a labor shortage? If so why are all these positions drawing 100+ applicants? I'm not really buying that there is a shortage at all.
