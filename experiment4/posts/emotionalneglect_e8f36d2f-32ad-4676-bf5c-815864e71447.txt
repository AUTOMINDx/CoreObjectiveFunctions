Importance of relationships
It's only taken me 31 years to realize...

I can't survive on my own.

I need people to thrive. I need people to enjoy life.

For so many years I had been trying to convince myself that I was fine on my own, that I didn't need anyone in my life, that most people were annoying anyways.

But through my experience in therapy so far, in the depth of feelings I've developed for my therapist, I realized how badly I crave human connection. And how much I have missed out on it throughout my life. I crave connection and intimacy, and not only have I denied myself these things, I have no idea how to cultivate them. 

The only person I feel connected to in my life is my therapist, and it's not even a mutual relationship. It's heartbreaking. I haven't allowed myself to be vulnerable with another person in over 6 years. I haven't had a friend in about 10 years. I'm a master at pushing others away, not letting them in. And now I have no idea how to reverse what I've done. Ive mastered a useless skill. Maybe it protected me as a child, but now it's destroying my life.

I am terrified at this realization that I need others. Because I have no idea how to connect. How to be authentic around others. What if I try and fail and still end up alone. I'm past the age where it's easy to make friends and meet people. The mountain I have to climb if I choose to tackle this is too fucking tall. But then again, I don't think I can live the rest of my life alone.
