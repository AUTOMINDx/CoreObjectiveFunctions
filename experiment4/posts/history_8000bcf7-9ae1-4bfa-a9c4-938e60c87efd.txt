Old peoples on foreign gods
I watched a video on youtube how Romans saw germanic gods ad their own but only with different names. For example: Odin was Mercury and Thor was Jupiter. But at the same time they accepted foreign gods in their pantheon: most famous are Isis and Abnoba. Which one was it then?

On the other hand: Jews and early christians saw other gods as demons. For example: mesopotamian gods Dagon and Moloch became lords in hell.

My question is: did ancient people belived in other gods as real? Did they feared them? Or did they see the other god as misinterpretation of their own in general?
