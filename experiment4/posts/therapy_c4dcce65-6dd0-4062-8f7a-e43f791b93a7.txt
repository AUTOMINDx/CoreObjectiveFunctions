Depression with anxiety/low self-esteem -&gt; loneliness &amp; perfectionism is all caused by underlying chronic shame
I'm a 44M over-achiever who went to a top university, then obtained a professional degree.  I participated in the world championship of an endurance event.  But I've struggled with major depressive disorder and loneliness throughout.  I consistently feel like 'the odd man out' in many situations.  I've long ago traced this to a fractured relationship with my parents; an angry mother and  a father who was either aloof or would pile-on scorn with my mother.

With the book *Understanding and Treating Chronic Shame*, I've come to better understand the source of my shame, and how it impacts me; before you buy it realize that it is written for clinicians, not clients.  I'm interested in whether anyone is working to conquer their shame and whether they have found any other sources of insights or Shame Scales that would be useful in a quest for recovery from shame.

Speaking of recovery, it talks about using the right brain as shame is a right brain problem that cannot be reversed by left-brain logic.
