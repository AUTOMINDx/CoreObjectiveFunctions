[NC] can they take away my money even though they didn't notify me of an hours change?
Hey I have an interesting senerio playing out. So my work place ( textile mill) pays employees an extra 50$ a week (covid pay) if they were there on there times all week. 
Well last week it turns out my supervisor asked one of my colleagues to come in on Saturday which I would have loved to do because I need the money 
Well now the lady in charge of money is saying I won't get that extra 50 because I wasn't there saterday. 
But neither employer or supervisor told me of this.

Is there somthing I can do ?
