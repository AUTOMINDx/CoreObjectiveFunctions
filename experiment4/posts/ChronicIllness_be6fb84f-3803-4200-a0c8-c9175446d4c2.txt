doctors won’t take me seriously
just got out of an emergency GP appt with a doctor who i haven’t seen before, but he treats my dad. had the appt bc i have tremors all over my body and they can’t/won’t go away. i was in A&amp;E about it on friday, was referred to neurology, but i’m shaking so badly it’s unbearable.

this dude talks to me for like 2 minutes, tests my reflexes and then says he thinks it’s probably just anxiety and that i also have CFS. problem being: 1. i’ve had anxiety since i was 12. never had tremors or shaking for the whole six years until now (i’m 18). 2. i can’t have CFS - firstly CFS doesn’t cause tremors, and secondly i’m not crashing after overexertion. i’m tired, sure, but no crashing. i’m fairly sure i have MS, but the only way to know is an MRI. 

he prescribed me some beta blockers, and turns out, after reading the NHS website, there’s not one but TWO reasons i can’t take them. i have raynaud’s phenomenon and asthma. good job bro, maybe when my fingers lose all circulation you’ll actually listen.

i’m so frustrated. no one is listening. i told this guy i was bedridden bc of fatigue and the next question he asks is “do you go for walks?”. …NO BC IM BEDRIDDEN. goddamn. 

why does no one seem to think that a suicidal, bedridden 18 year old might need actual medical care and attention?
