What on your thoughts behind the legalities and consequences of rape?
Trigger warning: rape

For more detail I (18M) was raped at 14 by my best friend (15F). She got me drunk and after saying no multiple times she threatened me with violence and I said yes. I’m just wondering what your thoughts are on consequences. A lot of people I have interacted with whole heartedly believe that because she was a female and I was a male her consequence shouldn’t be as severe if the roles were reversed. 

I would prefer if anyone reading this would avoid giving me condolences. I have gotten some help but am still psychologically effected by it. It was not reported because of fears of my family and friends and it has now been too long since it has happened to merit a report. It was a rape of opportunity and I am doubtful she would do it again. 

I’m just curious of what true feminists have to say since she claimed to be one herself. While she claimed to be one herself I believe her actions revoked any right of her being able to call herself a feminist but I don’t know. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who gives their thoughts and opinions. It would be greatly appreciated.
