Is it true that penguins become "insane," "deranged," or "disoriented" and travel away from their colonies to die, as accounted by Werner Herzog in "Encounters at the End of the World" (2009)?
This moment in the documentary fascinated me, where Herzog shows a penguin stopping in its tracks, and suddenly starts walking alone away from its home or hunting grounds towards the desolate mountains of Antarctica, where it will die. He says that the penguin scientist he talked to (though without directly showing us the scientist telling this) told him that, even if they went out and brought the penguin back, he would just go right back to his death march.

I really can't stop thinking about it, it's a strangely, somewhat upsettingly, human behavior that, if is how Herzog describes, certainly appears like the penguins are trying to die.

But when looking online, I couldn't find any scientific reports of this behavior, only people referring back to the documentary. The scientist seemed like a real scientist, but there's no information on this I could find.

Is there any truth to this? Is this a behavior scientists have observed in penguins, and if so is it as bleak as Herzog describes?
