2022 looks like gonna be a repeat of 2014 or a redo depending on how you see it
This Venus Retrograde plus some of the other transits definitely seem to point to a sort of a redo or repeat of 2014 depending on how it’s seen personally I am all for a redo of that year definitely made a lot of mistakes and hurt a lot of people that year and haven’t fully come to terms with it so In other words I see this as a positive thing that I can find closure and healing from a lot of the 2014 stuff and so can a lot of people and this Venus Retrograde will likely be the catalyst for that
