She asked how big my…. is
So I am really good friends with one of my classmates from last semester. We also helped each other with assignments and homework, and we were just cool with each other throughout the course. I thought we were just casual friends, and plus she has a boyfriend. But today on Christmas she sent me a text saying she was just curious, and asked how big my dick is. I have no idea how to respond to this. What am I supposed to say? She sent this earlier in the afternoon and I have not replied. We’ve never had any type of conversation like this, it has all been just casual friendly banter.

Edit: Wow I did not expect this question to have blown up like this. So I decided not to respond to her text and as of me writing this edit it is almost 11 AM the day after Christmas. I haven’t heard anything from her. After reading a lot of the comments it could be some sort of trap or something. I think I’m just going to ignore it and wait for her to text or call back or something.
