Holidays are the worst for lonely people.
I don't like Christmas. There are couples and families everywhere you turn. People that remind you how lonely you are.

Take me as an example. I do travel quite a bit, and until a couple of years ago my thoughts where "someday I will bring someone with me". Well, as you may guess, it didn't happen so far. Here I am travelling alone. Again. And I'm so tired.

I'm so tired of cooking for one. I'm so tired of going to bed wothou saying goodnight to anyone. I'm so tired of waking up and not seeing anyone. 

I started doing therapy some month ago (for a different issue). And I asked the therapist if it is something wrong or weird to wish for a relationship. The answer was pretty simple: it isn't at all. Some days we crave for the independecy and the loneliness. And when we get it, we decide it is time to, you know, build a stable relationship. 

But, ironically, of course, we don't get it for... whatsoever reason. 

And here I am. At the airport. Watching people going home to their families, partners and whatsoever. Wishing for the life they have.

And after this river of words, let me tell you: I hate Christmas.

Peace.
