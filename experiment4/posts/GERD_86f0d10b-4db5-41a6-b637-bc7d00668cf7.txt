Do all methods of caffeine ingestion have the same effect on the LES and acid production
It is well known that caffeine significantly lowers LES pressure AND increases acid secretion. My GERD symptoms are 10x when I drink caffeine even though I have a fundoplication. My question is would under the tongue caffeine mints produce the same effects? Has does anyone have information on this?

Edit: Coffee, Tea, Redbull, and caffeine pills all have the same effect on my stomach. My theory is that under the tongue pills will deliver caffeine right to my bloodstream without all the negative effects from having it in my stomach?
