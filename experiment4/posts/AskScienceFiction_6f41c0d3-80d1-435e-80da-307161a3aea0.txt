[The Good Place] What happens to children and babies that die?
I would think there would be something akin to the religious idea of an "age of reason," meaning that anyone too young to understand the consequences of their actions isn't considered morally responsible for their "sins." So I would think a young child who dies would get a pass into the good place. However, we know canonically that no one has gotten into the good place in a very long time.

I also thought perhaps that if kids are too young to earn points, they would be at zero when they die, no good and no bad, so maybe they'd go to a medium place. But we know from the show that Mindy St. Claire is the only person to ever get sent to the medium place. In addition, she got there because she had an amount of points exactly on the border between bad and good, so obviously she didn't have zero points. An adult who actually had zero points would go to the bad place.

So the only conclusion I can come to is that there is some area of the bad place where millions of little kids are being eternally tortured. Perhaps their "torture" isn't like the horrific things that happen to adults, but things that would really bother a child, like having a candy bar just out of reach forever, or being forced to kiss their ugly old grandmother (a la Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey).

I really don't want to believe that any of this is what happens to kids. Obviously they don't deserve it.

So, help me out here. What does happen to babies and little children who die before they are old enough to choose to do good or bad things?
