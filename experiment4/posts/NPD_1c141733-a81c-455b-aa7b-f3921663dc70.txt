Didn't realize this was discarding
I remember having an online friend and we would talk almost every day. We even sent eachother letters and packages of treats &amp; knickknacks that wasn't available outside our countries.

Suddenly, I felt a disconnect. I stopped talking to them. Sometimes I would make an effort to talk to them, but I just felt so burned out. 

Another time I had an online friend, we were less close but we always came to eachother for mental health advice. Neither of us were great at it but it was fun to share our experiences. They got married and started texting me less, so I just kinda dropped it and stopped texting them too.

Discarding is always described as an intentionally malicious act. You're "done" with the person so you "throw them away". For me and some other narcissists I've seen, it was just a combination of not really having our needs met and somehow forgetting the person existed a majority of the time because of how low effort they were.

I think it might be beneficial to label individual experiences based on how we experience them, rather than how other people experience us. A narcissist may ghost someone because they're malicious, they may be burnt out, they may ghost as an unhealthy coping mechanism bc they can't handle the consequences of confrontation, they may just be not getting their needs met. I think there are so many reasons why a narc may discard of someone, and to group it all into one category feels weird and counterproductive. But that's just me.

Well, whatever we call it - it appears that I've done it. Uhh, oops?
