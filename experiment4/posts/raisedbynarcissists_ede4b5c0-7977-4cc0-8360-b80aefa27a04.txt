Did anyone else have a parent that lied about knowing everything about you?
My mom genuinely wanted me to believe that she knew every little thing about me and lied about all the ways she sourced this information. She lied about reading my journals. She lied about having spyware on my computer/phone. She lied about my best friend of 10 years feeding information to her.

And I know none of this is true because for one, she accused me of things that were entirely false on account of the fact that she “knows that I did them because she read/saw/was told it”. 

The funny thing is that she accused *me* of lying through my teeth all the time, which I did do, but I only did it to cover up all the things she would be mad at me for doing. She said that she couldn’t trust anything I said because I’m a “compulsive liar”, when she literally lied about what she knew about me. 

She told me so many stories about people, people in my life doing awful things to her, and I just don’t know what part of it was real and what part was fake.
