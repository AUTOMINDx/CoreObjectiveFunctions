Stealing from a church mission trip...
So this happened when I was in high school, and my dad only told me about it recently. Our church had done a bunch of fundraisers and had raised money to drive down to the bay area and help to establish a church in an old gymnasium. So a group of 31 kids and 9 adults went on this trip. 

We had raised a little extra money to do some fun activities and go out to a couple of meals. For one of the meals we all voted to go to an all you can eat Mongolian grill (this was a terrible idea for a group of our size). 

There was a family who showed up as we (the adults) were figuring out the logistics of getting that many teenagers through the restaurant, so we let them go first. 

Everyone got through the line and my dad covered the bill with out church funds. 

While we were eating, my dad double checked the numbers and realized that we were charged for 46 plates instead of 40. When he noticed this he mentioned it to the other staff and as he was going up to talk with staff, the family who had showed up finished their meals and headed out. 

Turns out that family had claimed to be part of our group, and their plates were put on our tab. They rushed out when they realized they had been caught. 

My dad ended up not fighting it and covering their portion out of his money. Only $60 but still. 

I know they didnt realize we were a mission group but who the fuck would do something like this? We had worked pretty hard to raise money for this, so even though I found out years later, it really pissed me off.
