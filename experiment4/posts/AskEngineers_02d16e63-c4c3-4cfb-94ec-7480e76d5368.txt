How much of what you learn in college are you expected to know by heart by the time you graduate?
Because I feel like I am learning enough just to pass the classes but retaining that information is not easy. I take the information in fairly easily and quickly but it goes away just as fast. I do the the homework and move on to the next subjects. I study for the tests and then later study for the next tests. I feel it's all study to pass tests and get good grades but I don't really feel like I'm learning anything. When I took college algebra I took a summer 1 month class. Passed the class easily. But I chose to retake that class because I remembered almost nothing from it. Took a full semester course the second time. Got A's both times. But the problem is when I look at the problems I often can't just go "yeah I understand this" often I have to review the problems and how to do them. 

Is this a red flag or is this normal?
