How can we be more sensitive to conservatives feelings when discussing race?
So, what I’ve noticed in discussions surrounding race, CRT, history, systemic inequality, and so on, is that conservatives tend to take everything involving those subjects incredibly personally, while the liberals discussing these topics typically approach them with a practiced language of distance. Yes, various unjust, violent, sometimes outright evil practices of the past have shaped political and economic realities of the present, but there is often care taken to be specific. It’s not an individual, it’s the entire society. It’s not willful, it’s unconscious and pernicious. We didn’t make this mess, but the mess isn’t going to clean itself up.

Regardless of the tenderness and tact you might approach the subject with, conservatives seem to almost instantly take everything you say and respond as if you were saying it about them individually. How can we avoid this trap? These are sensitive people, and they’re incredibly easily offended, and I think that’s one of the biggest things driving the current culture war between the left and the right.

I may be slightly tongue in cheek here, but I’m mostly serious: how can we either diffuse their instant offense or bypass it all together so we can have these conversations without conservatives melting down?
