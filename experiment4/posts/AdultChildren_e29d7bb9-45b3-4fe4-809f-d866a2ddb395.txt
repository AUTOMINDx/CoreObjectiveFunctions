My dad finally agreed not to drink at Christmas
Have been NC with my dad since last February. This man gaslights me and is so absorbed in his own denial it's impossible to talk to him about his issues. But I just received email (the only way he is allowed to contact me) that he won't drink on christmas if I agree to come. 

I'm feeling torn. I didn't expect him to come around this fast, and I also hate the concept of only being able to see him on his terms (ex: if he decides to drink on christmas next year so I wouldn't see him). I doubt he believes he has any sort of problem, he just wants to see me. 

I am very torn on what to do. He also said it's fine if I'm not ready. I just wish I had a different dad so I didn't have to worry about this. What do you guys think
