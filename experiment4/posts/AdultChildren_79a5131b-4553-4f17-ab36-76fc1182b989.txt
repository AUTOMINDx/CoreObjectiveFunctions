First Christmas without them
It’s my first Christmas without my toxic family and I’m feeling super conflicted. On one hand I’m glad to be away from the fake love. On the other hand I’m feeling like I’m over reacting to them… then I remember why I wanted to cut them off and it makes me depressed. My husband is so supportive but he doesn’t really understand because he saw the mellowed out old people version of my parents and my toxic siblings , he wasn’t around for my parents Prime when the drinking and neglect and fighting was at an all time high. He does notice the slick disses and shady ways of my parents. So he knows I’m doing what’s right, but I still feel so isolated. I’m one of 6 kids… and I was the “Fixer/Hero” I worked really hard despite the road blocks given to me to be the family savior and make money and get the big house so we can have holidays but my efforts have been seen as obnoxious and caused deep jealousy and vindictive behavior first towards me… then to my kids. They allowed my niece to be a bully just like her beloved grandpa and they sent my child home in tears the last I saw them. There’s been constant screaming battles and I had to seek real therapy to get over this. But holidays make people nostalgic. So I’m comes Big beautiful Christmas presents to me children and at first I tried to play the silent game but I broke and cussed them out, because you can’t buy back our love and trust. Now I’m the family asshole and I’m refusing the big family Christmas at my Aunts house because I don’t want to be the jerk to ruin everyone’s holiday because I can’t control my temper with them. I just had to vent because regardless I’m breaking away and that’s final. But it still hurts ya know.
