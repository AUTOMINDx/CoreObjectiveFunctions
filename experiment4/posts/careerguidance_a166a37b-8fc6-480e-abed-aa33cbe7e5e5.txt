My last day. My coworkers hug me and say thank u for everything and that they really like me. I'm doubting my decision now. Is this normal?
feel like im making a big mistake on resigning but I can't stay like this. I need to move on so I wouldn't be stagnant. I'm only 26 and my work is really slow, I barely learn anything but my coworkers are really nice. I don't bring work at home but I dont know. I feel like all i do is go to work, do a bit of work then sit down for the whole day. Its really slow. I barely learn anything new and the world outside is moving so fast.

Did anybody ever have this feeling before?  Like u feel like u need to do better and try to keep improving urself but at the same time ur conflicted if ur doing the right decision... i feel like im making a big mistake
