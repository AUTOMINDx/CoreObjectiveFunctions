Is there any evidence for explanation to gender paradox in suicide?
In most Western countries women have higher rates of suicide attempts than men, yet mortality from suicide is typically lower for women than for men.


I've heard some people explain this as women choosing less lethal means of suicide due to caring more about not leaving a mess for their loved ones, and I've heard other people say that the statistics are indicative of a stronger degree of intent to die in men than women and that's why women use less lethal means. Although I've seen both explanations used, I've never seen anyone back it up with evidence.


Since both theories have problematic implications, is there actually any evidence to either one? Or are both wrong?


**edit: Thanks for your answers, this is a response I got in r/asksocialscience that I thought was interesting.**


Canetto and Lester find that the gender paradox may hold true in western, English-speaking countries, but is not consistent across countries and historical times. Rather, they find that patterns of suicidal behavior tend to conform to cultural scripts. [Canetto &amp; Lester]

A study of suicide rates across several countries and time periods found that in cultures that place a high value on individualism, the risk of fatal suicide in men is increased, while greater Power-Distance (extent to which less powerful members of organizations and institutions accept and expect unequal power distributions) predicts more equal male and female suicide rates.

According to the Oxford Handbook of Suicidology, countries in which there are more female completed suicides include China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran, among others. 

In a study of suicide completion in two German cities, Cibis et al find that even when methods are the same (e.g. hanging or poisoning), men were still more likely to complete than women; the authors assert that lethality or non-lethality of method is therefore not the only factor behind the gender paradox in suicide.

Canetto posits that individuals are influenced by cultural scripts for suicide that vary not only not in which methods, but also which outcomes are considered more or less acceptable/unacceptable for each gender.
