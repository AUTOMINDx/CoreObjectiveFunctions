How do I respond to people who point out that I'm a woman?
I'm younger, 19 to be exact, and am pretty awkward overall. I also take interest in the automotive field. Ever since I have, and ever since I've started work in said field, I get comment after comment about how "oh, it's so nice to see a woman working here!" or "yeah, girl power!" Just stuff like that. I never know how to respond as I don't see the fact that I'm a woman as anything special, no matter the job field; it always catches me off guard and I usually respond "yeah, it is pretty rare" or something to that effect. I don't see what being a woman has to do with anything. What would be a better response to this? Any examples or context would be appreciated, thanks!
