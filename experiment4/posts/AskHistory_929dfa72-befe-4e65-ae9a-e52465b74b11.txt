Is there a historical example of the "Return of the lost King" trope?
This is a common trope in movies/books where either an existing ruler or the child of a great ruler gets lost/disappears/goes into hiding for a significant amount of time (10+ years) and then upon their return find both support and admiration, rallying thousands to their cause as they go and overthrow whatever the entity was that had done them the injustice

10-15 years is a looong time, i understand friends and family being super stoked to see you but for them to be given the reigns to the the ship/company/castle/country just like that? "you're the true king, here are 100,000 men ready to die for you, let's go crack some heads"

has this ever actually happened?

EDIT: WOW! learning a lot, thank you all
