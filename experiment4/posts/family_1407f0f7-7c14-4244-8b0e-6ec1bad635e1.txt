My father is suddenly religious and its unfortunately making me uncomfortable
I guess it’s uncomfortable because my family growing up was never super religious.

We would attend church once and a while, take a hiatus, go on Christmas Eve and that was it. I just don’t really connect with the church just because I wasn’t really brought up under it and every time we did go, I never enjoyed it.

I’m now 27 and my dad is in his late sixties. He’s suddenly reading the Bible every single day, listening and buying religious/church music, watching church on tv, etc. 

He will read me Bible verses now when I come over to visit and it doesn’t comfort me, it kinda annoys me. Like why can’t he talk about anything else other than scripture?

It’s also beginning to annoy my mom, as she thinks he’s a bit of a hypocrite sometimes in his actions on a day to day. 

Is this normal for a parent to suddenly take up religion and somewhat force it onto their kids? 

Should I express how this makes me uncomfortable?
