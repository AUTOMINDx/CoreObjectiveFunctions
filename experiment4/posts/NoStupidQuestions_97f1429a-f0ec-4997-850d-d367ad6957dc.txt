Non-American here. When driving from one state to another, will there be some sort of Immigration or place before you’re allowed to enter another state?
Let’s say I’m from Illinois and I drove to Indiana, will I be freely allowed to go to the state or will there be a place where my documents would be processed first before I’m allowed to enter Indiana?

Edit: yeah, I know driving from Illinois to Indiana is inconvenient but I have no clue how interstates work lol
