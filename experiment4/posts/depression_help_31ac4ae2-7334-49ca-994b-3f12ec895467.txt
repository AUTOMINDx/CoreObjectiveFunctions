Don’t knock how much even a tiny bit of exercise can help.
I went/am going through the worst depression of my life this past year. It got to the point where I almost attempted and couldn’t get out of bed to eat, shower or really even get myself water. I did nothing but lay in bed, drink, sleep and cry for about a year... gained 70lbs, hated everything about myself and my life.

My therapist told me I really needed to get out of bed even if it was for something tiny and just going right back to bed. After forcing myself to get up to do the dishes a few times a week, I could finally force myself to leave the house and go on small drives. Then I started taking short 15-20 minute walks and that’s when my depression completely 180’d. 

There’s a massive, noticeable difference in how much motivation I can hold onto and how baseline content/not miserable I feel after going on a walk. Even if it’s just a few minutes, I force myself to go on one every day and I’ve effectively brought so much motivation back that I’m taking care of myself every day, eating every day, even making art again and reading.

I’m now able to walk for 2.5 hours at 3mph after just a month of doing this. When I started at 15 minutes and that was a massive struggle and I could hardly do it without sobbing. 

Please don’t knock how much exercise can help. I used to manage my depression with exercise before the pandemic and when the gyms closed down, it was like I had my antidepressant suddenly stopped. I finally starting to feel like myself again. I still have some really bad days but for the most part, it feels like I’ve got my head above water and am just occasionally dipping under rather than straight up drowning. 

Get out of bed my friends. Even if it takes everything in you. Even if you can only manage 5 minutes. Trust the process. There’s tons of science to back it up too.
