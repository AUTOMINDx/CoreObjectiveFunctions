Zombies making the zombie argument
Suppose the zombie argument is true: zombies are conceivable and metaphysically possible. There is a zombie world which is physically identical to our world but without consciousness in a possible world. However, since it is identical to us, we would have a zombie version of, say, David Chalmers making the argument that because he can conceive of zombies without consciousness, they exist. However, he himself does not have consciousness. This situation seems absurd. What does this entail? How would a proponent of the zombie argument view this situation?
