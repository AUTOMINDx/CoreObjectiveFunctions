Just, they're ignoring me, aren't they??? [mtf]
I've laid so many fucking clues and my fucking conservative parents just don't get it at all... I just want to fucking tell them what's been in my head for 10 years... I want to tell them I wore my sister's fucking prom dress and stretched it tf out and that it wasn't fucking due to baclofen or depression or whatever shit excuse my brain thinks of. I want to tell them I fucking went to my mothers closet every night when I was 14. I just want to fucking tell them about my thoughts which just plague me every time I see myself in the mirror. I want to tell them every damn thing, I just can't bc of a dumb stupid fucking fear of rejection... Fuck me and my stupid overthinking brain!! :/
