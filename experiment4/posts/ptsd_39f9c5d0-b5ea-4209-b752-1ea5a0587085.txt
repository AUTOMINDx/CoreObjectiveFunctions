Forgetting who you are - is this normal?
I've had PTSD for over 10 years now, so it's hard for me to remember what things were like before. But I have noticed that sometimes I have a problem with remembering who I am. I noticed it sometimes with dating - things flow naturally at first, then I reach a point where I start to lose my sense of identity  - I.e. someone is trying to get to know me, and I start to have this feeling that I have no idea who I am.

PTSD sort of destroyed my self-image and sense of solid identity. Sense then, I've re-invented myself so many times - sometimes as a way of escape, and sometimes with a great sense of joy and freedom. But maybe because of this, I feel like I have no solid identity. Maybe I'm missing some kind of grounding? I just sometimes feel as if I easily lose my sense of self - it's like a thought on the tip your tongue, or a memory that just slips away.

Does anyone else relate?? Would love to know if anyone else feels this way.
