What's the estimated true number of COVID-19 deaths to date?
The COVID-19 pandemic has been running for about 2 years now. The 1918 influenza pandemic lasted for approximately two years and 25 to 50 million people died from that flu. Right now we're officially at 5.4 million deaths from COVID-19, but the true number is likely much higher due to under reporting. Hopefully it's not 25 million. I've looked around some search engines a bit, and this question doesn't have a clean answer, but does anyone here have a good estimate of the true global number of COVID-19 deaths?Thanks!
