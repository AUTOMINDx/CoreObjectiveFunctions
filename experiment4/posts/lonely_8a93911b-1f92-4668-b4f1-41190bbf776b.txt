Deleted all my dating apps today
All online dating has done is made a simple relationship feel even more unattainable for me. It got to that stage where I'd actively look foward to matching and conversing with catfishes and scammers since that's the only people I'd match with and have conversations with outside work. 

Enough is enough though, it's masochism for me to continue using these apps or to expect that I'll ever have a life partner. It's time to accept it and move on
