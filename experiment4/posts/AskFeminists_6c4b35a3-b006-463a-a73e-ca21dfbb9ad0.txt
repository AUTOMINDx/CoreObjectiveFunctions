What are the biggest/most substantial changes you’ve seen in your lifetime?
Unsure if this is the right kind of question for this sub but I was just wondering, how have things developed from your perspective? I’ve seen a shift in some attitudes and laws, but what are some of the changes you’ve witnessed and how have they affected you?

ETA: Thank you to everyone who has commented! It’s great to read these and see what stood out to people over the years, and the personal stories are really touching.

Side info: I’m 25 from NZ, you don’t have to add your details if you don’t want to but it’s interesting to know where these things happened!
