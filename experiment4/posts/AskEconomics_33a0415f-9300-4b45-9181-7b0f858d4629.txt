How can I remember a bunch of different formulas and mathematical processes?
In the real world, I would look up a formula to use it or have used it enough that I know it by heart, but when taking doctoral level classes, with no formula sheet, how does one memorize 20 formulas and numerous processes? In undergrad, I would use mnemonic devices such as acronyms or the Roman Room method, but numbers are harder. Frankly, I'm overwhelmed and wondering if there is a funner or more efficient way of learning so many formulas and processes? Any tips? Help? Experience?
