r/ptsd is not the place to get your diagnosis
I’ve noticed recently that there seem to be a lot of posts where people are asking if they have PTSD.

Am I the only one who thinks r/ptsd needs to be kept as a support network for rather than an online forum doctors office?

A lot of these posts seem to be moderate anxiety disorders or depression to me caused by day to day life rather than a traumatic event.

Edit: Thank you for the silver and wholesome award! Didn’t think so many people felt the same way.
