Raytheon Technologies- Difference between principle and principal?
Have a tentative phone interview set up for a Principle engineering position- 

Requirements seem a bit vague and honestly kind of low for a Principle position 

They also seem to interchange (Principle and Principal) on job postings. 

I work at honeywell where hierarchy goes

Eng 1,2,3,Sr., Lead, Principal, Staff, Tech fellow 

I am currently a Sr.  at Honeywell - I'm just wondering if anyone knows if I am truly looking at a skip level or if Raytheon has a different structure or if this is just title inflation.
