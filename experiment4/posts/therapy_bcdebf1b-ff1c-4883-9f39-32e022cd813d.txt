My therapist is not a fit for me. I am going to start looking for another one soon. I think she is a nice lady and means well.Dont know how to tell her I am going to be moving on.
I have never felt I could be myself totally, or felt that I was in a safe space with her. 

It's just not a fit for many reasons. I dont know how to tell her I want to find someone else who is a better fit.

I dont want to hurt her feelings, or end things where one or both of us feels uncomfortable.

What is the kindest way to do this? 

Appreciate any advice.
