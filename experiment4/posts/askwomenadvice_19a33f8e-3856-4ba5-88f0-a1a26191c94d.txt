How do I navigate this situation? My (f) current partner (m) who I’ve been with for a few years now has made it clear to me that he doesn’t like tattoos or piercings despite the fact I already have a few tattoos that are small and mostly hidden along with multiple piercings.
I’ve always been up front with him about liking them and wanting more. I plan to get another one and he is very upset about it. The only reason he gives me is that “no one in his family has them and he doesn’t like them.” So it’s not the subject matter or placement, just the act of having tattoos itself. I’m not sure how to feel or if this is normal in a healthy relationship.
