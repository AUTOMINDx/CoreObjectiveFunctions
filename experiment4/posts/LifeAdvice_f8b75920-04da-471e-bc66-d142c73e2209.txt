I (M20) have zero direction in life.
I’m 20 years old and have zero direction right now. I know it’s a common thing for people my age to not know what they want to do but it’s something that really stresses me out. I completed one year of college and on the second year, I failed out. They were easy classes and they were all online because of COVID but I just didn’t care so I failed them. I have a lot of issues with my mental health including depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts etc. All of this doesn’t help anything. I work at some restaurant right now but I cringe every time i think about going from job to Job the rest of my life with never any real direction or purpose. My social life is a complete mess ever since I left college. I am in contact with zero people. Not my brother who lives in another state, not any of my old friends, and barely my parents because I work at night. I’ve always been a shy person so it’s very hard for me to make friends. My sex life is non-existent. I haven’t had sex in three years and it’s not because I can’t, because people always say I’m good looking. Its because I always get in my own head and have no self confidence. It’s a lonely life and my day to day just consists of absolutely nothing over and over again. I’ve thought about moving to another country or doing something drastic, but I feel that will do nothing if I don’t fix the root of the problem first. But I don’t even know what the root is. There is no room for growth in my current lifestyle. I can’t keep living like this and I’m not sure what to do. If anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
