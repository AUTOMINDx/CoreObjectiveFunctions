How to restart your career and life at 30?
I turned 30 this year and having a hard time shaking this feeling that I'm a loser. I moved back home with family about 5 or 6 months after missing one class from my HR diploma and haven't worked or done anything other workout and watch podcasts. I wasted a lot of my mid twenties being depressed and also spent my early twenties drinking, partying and working for entry level jobs for no longer than a year. 

I'm thinking about returning to school to attempt another diploma/associates in fitness in a much bigger city/away from family again but I'm not too sure it's a good idea. Used to be a loving sociable guy but had a few rough interactions/relationships at a couple previous jobs which caused a lot of emotional pain/guilt. At this point I don't really have any friendships and old friends think I was a flake/bad friend for bailing on then when I thought I was improving my life. 

At this point I'm having a hard time figuring out how to move forward. I also don't really have enough dough for therapy so not sure that's an option. Anyways... Any advice would be helpful/great. Thanks a lot.
