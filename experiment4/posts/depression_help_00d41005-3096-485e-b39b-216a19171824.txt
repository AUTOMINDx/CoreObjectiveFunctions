I need to forget about them.
i just can’t go on. When I see them i start to shake, when I hear them i start to feel really anxious and cry, I’m terrified about them. I have nightmares about that relationship and I can’t stay in a place if they are there. I just can’t go on, i can’t do anything but thinking about them. It’s a paranoia, i can’t do it anymore. Please help, it’s sad that im asking for help on reddit even knowing that they can read this but pls i can’t. I don’t want to live in this way anymore. please.
