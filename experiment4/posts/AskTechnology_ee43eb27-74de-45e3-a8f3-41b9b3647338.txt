When I get calls from friends, they are from random numbers
I moved from Germany to Czech but my service provider still works in that country. 

I've saved many numbers from new friends I met here but when I get calls from them, the number that shows up is from Germany. It's a random different number every time and it happens with everyone who calls from here. It doesn't matter what country their service provider is based in, as long as it's not German, I always get their calls from unknown German numbers.

Does anyone know what the issue is? Any info is appreciated!
