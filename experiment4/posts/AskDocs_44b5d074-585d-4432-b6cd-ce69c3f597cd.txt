My girlfriend has been vomiting for 5 days straight, is there a product or treatment to make sure she gets enough nutrients into her system.
***CHS***

She is 22 years old. Has been taking an SSRI for anxiety and depression. She has had an IUD for two years. she is 5'8" 205LBS. We live in Canada. She has been using a vape pen to consume marijuana (daily use) for 7 months I'd say. Sexually active.

She was taken to the ER Monday and Wednesday and received IVs both times and that seemed to really help her energy. I think and the doctors in the ER both times think it is CHS caused by overuse of the vape pen. She hasn't been taken to the ER since Wednesday but, still pukes within 5-15mins. of consuming anything (water included).

My question: " what else should I do? Is there some suppository for getting nutrients like water and calories into her system? She has less and less energy each hour, only speaks in single words, I am afraid that she won't have the energy to get better. Thanks for reading."
