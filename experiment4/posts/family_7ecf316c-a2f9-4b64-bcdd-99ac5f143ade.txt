I don't think I would be very sad if my mum died. Am I a bad person?
My mum had a heart attack last week and is in hospital. I have gone over to her place so that I can look after her when she gets out. Had an argument with my sister today because she claimed our mum did OK as a parent. In reality, she was abusive and since the argument I have been getting flashbacks of all of the cruel things she used to do. Although I am mostly hoping she will recover, part of me wonders at times whether this is karma.

Then my thoughts went over to how I would feel if she died. If I am being honest, I would cry and be sad for a few days. But after that? I would probably get over it quicker than most people would when their parents die.

Maybe it's because I don't get to see her now due to the Covid restrictions. Not being able to see how frail she currently is and remembering the way she was when she had her full strength has probably hardened me. Is this wrong?

Tl;dr I am having unsympathetic thoughts about my mum after she had a life-threatening event and wonder if there is something wrong with me
