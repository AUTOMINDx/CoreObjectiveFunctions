Apologising to people you didn’t treat well
Well today I texted a few family members being totally honest about how have been self centred, selfish, think of myself first. I ain’t going to lie, it was extremely difficult &amp; painful to do. Even now that I sent it I am feeling embarrassed and almost like I shouldn’t of sent it. Is it normal to feel this much resistance to admitting guilt? Did I do the right thing? Deep down it felt like it was right but now I am feeling very emotional and sad. The thing i hate is the feeling of admitting I am not the best of people and that im working on myself. It’s like burning my soul.
