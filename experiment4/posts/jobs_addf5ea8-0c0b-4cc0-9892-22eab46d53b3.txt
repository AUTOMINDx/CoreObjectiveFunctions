Just got fired. My fault. What do?
I am still reeling. First job out of college in software development. Been there 2+ years. 3 weeks ago they offered me a full time position with them (been working full time as an "independent contractor" until now).

There were peeformacne write ups in the past and I did improve. But now here I am.

Edit for clarity's sake:

Was offered full position 3 weeks ago but hadn't done the on boarding yet. They were waiting for new year. So my contract was terminated.
