Unintentionally cut during surgery ?
Hi! I was wondering if it’s normal to have a cut on the left side of my stomach after an ankle surgery? 

Am I missing something and it’s common like for anesthesia or something? 

I’m 4 weeks PO and I just noticed the white non-dissolving stitch and an 3 cm cut. It doesn’t seem that deep. Nobody told me anything. Should I get it removed now and call the hospital or wait till my next appointment? 

(I know it’s stupid to worry about a random stitch on my body when I just got 15 screws and 4 plates put in my body. It’s just that I was surprised to discover this.)

Edit: Here is the cut: https://imgur.com/a/Bw5EqH8

Edit 2: My next appointment is in approx. a month.
