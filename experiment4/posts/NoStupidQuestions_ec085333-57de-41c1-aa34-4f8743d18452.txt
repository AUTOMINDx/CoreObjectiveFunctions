What is the appeal of going to a strip club?
I get that there’s hot topless women there, but you go and get hard with the boys and then go home? I don’t understand the appeal of getting yourself all hot and bothered and then not having sex. So you just pay someone to give you blue balls before you drive home with your mates? I know the dancers will have sex with you at some places, but it’s certainly not expected or common place. What is the appeal? Is it just to get material for the mental fap bank?
