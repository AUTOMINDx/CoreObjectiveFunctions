Gmail gave me away.
So, my parents found out my new name from my Gmail address and questioned me about it. I didn't tell them right away but send them a text, telling them I was nonbinary and that I was not comfortable to talk about it at the moment, but refered them to a website, that explains nonbinary gender identity. Now I am sitting in my room and trying not to shit myself because of that dam anxiety I got. Fuck my life! I really need some uplifting thoughts now, even though my parents seem to be supportive.
