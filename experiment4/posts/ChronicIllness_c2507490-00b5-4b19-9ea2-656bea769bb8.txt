The look people give when you *appear* healthy
I (22f) have had juvenile idiopathic arthritis for 10ish years and I’ve received this look so many fckin times. Whenever I first tell someone about my arthritis or when I say I can’t physically do something due to pain/ fatigue and they kinda look me up and down as if to say “but you look fine”. I’ve received that look so many times in my life, it took me years to get diagnosed bc I LOOKED healthy and played sports. My pain was dismissed as me being over dramatic until there was visible damage to my hands/wrists.

Which brings me to an hour ago when my mainly wheelchair-bound father who also has RA gave me the “you look fine” once over when I said I couldn’t go pick up dinner tonight. He asked me why and I said “because I’m really not feeling well, I’m exhausted” and he looked me up and down then said “oh… Are you sure you can’t even just run out to get something?”. I just went to my room. I was taken aback. I busted my butt today and yesterday organizing their new fridge and cleaning the kitchen. I just started B-cell therapy, I’m using my cane right now, I’m starting physical and occupational therapy, and I just went under 2 weeks ago for a procedure. But my parents look at me and see able bodied. They don’t understand why I’m so upset right now or mourning my body because they simply don’t listen when I explain the gravity of the situation. My dad thinks I should just feel lucky that there’s so much new technology and medicine compared to when he was diagnosed.  My pain isn’t valid .
 Sorry this turned into a rant about the general lack of support or belief from my parents. I’m tired.
