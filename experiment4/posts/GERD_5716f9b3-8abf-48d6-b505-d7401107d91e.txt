Never EVER eat a trigger food. Never.
Today me and my girlfriend wanted to have a pizza&amp;movie night in our bed. I’ve been managing my lpr pretty well in the last few months so i thought one ‘cheat night’ won’t hurt.
I was wrong. I ate 3slices of pizza in a sitting, laying position.

It’s 5hours passed since, i still cant sleep, having insane amount of mucus in my throat, my stomach hurts, have to burp constantly, my head is full of mucus, acid came up in my throat so it bleeds, can’t even lay down and hug my gf, and having very bad anxiety and dark and scared thoughts. I just watch her sleep and hope she doesnt notice anything about my condition.

I’m done, i can’t take it anymore. I just want to live a normal life, doing normal things, enjoy life.

Been on ppis and I took a h2blocker, doesnt really help that much.

Lpr/gerd is the worst thing in my life, i’d rather have my bone to break everytime a symptom comes instead of this.
