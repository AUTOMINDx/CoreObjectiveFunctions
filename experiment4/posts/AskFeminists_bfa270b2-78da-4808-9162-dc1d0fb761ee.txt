Have you ever met men who used to discriminate against women but now stop and now treat women with respect or even call for their rights?
I just wonder if there are a lot of men out there who learn to respect women.  ( I am male). For me to be honest, I never make dirty jokes on girls because I have two sisters and a mother who I love so I respect women a lot. But I used to make fun of LGBTQ (which now I won't) friends in the boarding school. I think it is because of the toxic male society that I lived in that I learned all that bad habits. But I changed so just want to know other people's experiences.
