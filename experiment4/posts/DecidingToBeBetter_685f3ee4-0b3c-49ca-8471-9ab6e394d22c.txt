Today is been a week since my last cigarette
I'm 21 (almost 22), smoker for about 6 years and today is the first time i've been without a cigarette for a week. I'm craving for a cig but what my friend said to me stuck on my head. We know each other for 3 years and started working together last year, completely online because of the pandemic, until last week the team decided that we could use a weekend together (covid is pretty controlled where we live) so we went to a camp house. Everyone had a few drinks but my friend had a few more and she starts hugging me, thing that she has never did before, i asked why and her answer almost broke me. She said "because you are always with that stinking cigarette on your finger/mouth, you are a great company but i know a few people that can't stand more than 5 minutes with you because that shite". I was glad that she was drunk and finally said that to me, i think it was the most honest thing anyone said to me in the last few years and was some hard truth that i need to hear as well. The next day i smoked one cigarette after everyone left and promised to me that this was the my last cig. I know that is impossible but i want to try and quit this filthy habit. Sorry about the long text and the multiple errors but i needed to tell this to someone (i didnt talked to my friend yet, want to be at a longer streak first). Thanks for listening people.
