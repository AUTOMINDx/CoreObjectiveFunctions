I’m scared of therapy because I feel shame in my issues and I’m afraid that if I face them I’ll get worse
I’ve struggled with my mental stability for a long time now, and I’ve done some work to get myself where I want to be. But people keep telling me that therapists are the way to go. But I’m afraid of going through therapy because I’m ashamed of things that I’ve done and that have happened to me. I feel like if I go to a therapist I’ll lose myself and potentially fall deeper into the hole I’m in. I’m scared that they’ll tell me what I know is the truth deep down and it’s going to push me to do things that I stopped doing for a while. I used to hate myself and treat people like shit because of how I carried myself as a person. I used to not care about myself and I still to an extent dont. I feel scared that my mental stability is teetering the line. I don’t know what to do anymore.
