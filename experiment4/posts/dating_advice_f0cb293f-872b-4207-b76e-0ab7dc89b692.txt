If they really want you, they'll make the effort.. is TRUE!!!
I always heard people saying this sentence but thought that people are actually making the effort by trying to arrange meeting up and I thought that was enough.. until I met someone who actually booked a flight ticket all the way from Australia to north America just to come and see me. I'm speechless because in the past some guys would even be hesitant to drive for 20 minutes to meet me halfway and I was so understanding about it
