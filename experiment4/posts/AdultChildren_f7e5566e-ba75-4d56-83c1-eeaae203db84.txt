My alcoholic father is neglecting his new puppy
I’ve (24F) been living with my dad and his partner for a little bit (i flip flop between his house and my narcissistic moms, so u can see how that’s fun! lol) and hes been an alcoholic all my life and he goes on binges and then dry spells so you never know when it’s coming. He recently got a puppy and he hasn’t had a dog since i was 4 so he was super excited for her and basically did sober research for like 2 months on the breed etc before he got her. 

Not sure what triggered it but 2 days after getting the pup he decided to go on a drinking binge where he’s basically non-functional and he’s alone most of the time with the dog because both me and his partner work full time while he is retired. 

I come home and the dog has no water, has not been outside to pee or anything as my dad was passed out drunk on the couch.

I don’t really know what to do?? Like i have to work but im considering not going so this puppy doesnt get neglected?? It’s really unfortunate and sad as he was so excited to get her and is now treating her like shite. Makes you wonder how he was with me and my sister when we were babies. Any advice is 👌🏻
