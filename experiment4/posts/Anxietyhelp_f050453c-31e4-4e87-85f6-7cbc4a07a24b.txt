Work anxiety consuming me
I recently started a new job for a big tech company in a support role. I knew all that entailed when I applied. I knew that I’d be uncomfortable and it would be a big learning curve. I’m done my training and on Monday, I’m on my own. I go through bouts of being like “I’ve got this!” to “what the fuck am I doing, I’m going to fail”. I’m at the point where once again, I can’t sleep because it’s al I’m thinking about and when I do sleep, I dream about it and often wake up with heart palpitations. I try so many things to calm myself down but it’s almost never working now. Ugh. What to do?
