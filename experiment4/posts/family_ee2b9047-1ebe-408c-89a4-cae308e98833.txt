Is it bad that I dislike my mom's family?
Like my (21F) maternal grandparents, my mom's sister and brother and their respective families. They're all just so toxic. Attention seekers, fake, plastic, gossip mongers, self obsessed narcissists, have bratty badly brought up destructive disrespectful kids who even abuse in public (they're all below 14 years of age) and they all use my mom. But they still wanna act nice because "family".

I find this all very exhausting and is causing me a lot of distress and anxiety. My mother has called them all over for New Year and I've gone into a state of trauma and rage.

She didn't even tell me they were coming until I found out and she just lied to me saying they weren't because I was pissed. But now I found out it was a lie to keep me calm.

She won't even let me leave the house because it would be disrespectful to them. She makes me feel like shit for hating on them and I'm starting to feel so messed up right now like I'm a bad person or something. It's making me question whether I'm a good human or not.
