A father looking for suggestions
Hello Friends,

I’m a 35 year old CIS male. I’m married. My daughter is three years old and my son is closer to two than he is to one. My wife and I have agreed we are not interested in having any more children. We got very lucky to experience a girl and a boy and are very appreciative of that.


Now that my daughter is really starting to discover her personality and beginning to grow into the person she is going to be, I’m becoming more and more aware of my influence as a father.

My wife, her mother, my step mother (she raised me so my mom really) are very strong, wonderful and beautiful women. My daughter and son have fantastic immediate female role models in their lives. 

I like to think of myself is far left and chill. Not religious, not interested in making a lot of money. I just want to do my job and clock out at five to be with my family.

However my father and my father in law…..well, let’s just say I’d be the only one of the three talking about RBG as a positive thing.

Now, I love my wife beyond measure, our marriage is rock solid and I know my children will grow up in happy, healthy home full of love.

But I want to be sure I’m preparing my daughter, the best I can, as a father, for the things she will face as a woman. 

At the same time, I want to be sure of giving my son the best education I can, again from my role as a father, on the power of women and the respect they deserve as equals.

What would you recommend as reading materials, activities, etc that I can do with my children moving forward?

What suggestions do you have?
