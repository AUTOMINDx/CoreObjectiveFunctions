Update on me reporting my old therapist
I'm not sure if anyone cares lol, but even after I submitted the report I was still second guessing myself. But between speaking to my case analyst and hearing that I have more evidence than I thought to prove that she broke multiple codes, watching the practice try to cover things up, and having my current therapist and her supervisor both supporting me through this, has really helped me recognize that what she did was wrong and that I did the right thing. 

She said the process would take 6-12 months, so I don't know if it will continue to feel this validating, but I guess I just needed somewhere to put this.

Edit: a lot of you guys want to know what she did, but I've never been part of an ongoing investigation before so I don't want to give out any possible identifying info. I can say that she abandoned me as a client, lied to me, and stole from me. Thank you guys for all of your support‚ù§
