The average person is boring as fuck
I hate to pass crass generalisations like that but experience has left me with no other conclusion to draw.

Every now and then I’ll meet someone with genuinely interesting passions and/or opinions and/or humour, but most people are clones forged in the mould that society has set.

I can barley bring myself to ask questions because I’m able to predict their response with like 95% accuracy. Even people who look interesting e.g transgressive fashion and hair and tattoos often turn out to be bland as hell when you look beyond their outer shell. 

It’s a horrible pretentious mindset, but goddamn if it isn’t true most of the time.

What can I do about it?

Edit; I’m not claiming to be the worlds most interesting person myself by any means I’m far from it, but I just struggle to find the enthusiasm to continue interacting with someone I’ve more or less met a hundred times before
