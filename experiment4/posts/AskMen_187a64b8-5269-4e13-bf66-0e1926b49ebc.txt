How the fuck does one enjoys clubs?
Seriously, how the hell do you enjoy clubs or loud bars, for all that matters?
Disgustingly overpriced drinks, obnoxious music that is so loud your head starts aching without earplugs, dancing is litetally "jumping up and down the spot"

Picking up girls? Forget it. I must have missed the pick-up artist lesson at my school, because it's so loud you don't have a chance for conversation.

Having fun? Why would I pay â‚¬10 to get entry to a place where I am smothered by sweaty, drunk bodies, only so i can go deaf with terrible music? 

Seriously, why are clubs even a thing?
