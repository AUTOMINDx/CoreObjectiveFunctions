I know nothing about Engineering or Coding but I would like to make something that would make my job easier at work.
So I work at a restaurant and emabout every 15 minutes I'm supposed to do a table count(basically tell them how many people are ordering.) Problem is when the restaurant gets really busy I can't go back to the kitchen to let then know. So I had the idea to make 2 sort of LED counting panels that connect to each other wireless and every time I seat someone I can click a button that makes a number go up/down/reset. Making it myself was what first came to mind, I'm not sure if something like this is easily available for an average Joe but yeah any advice would be helpful.
