Sent my superior my resignation/two week notice now they are trying to convince me to stay
So a little over a week ago I was turned down for a promotion due to office politics. So i made the decision to resign my position as an analyst at my company and decided to look for another job in my field else where. My manager was not not happy with my decision (I help out with alot of his own work) and got my Director involved. To convince me to stay they're offering 15% above my current base and they promised me a managerial role when another pops up. Should i take it or still leave. Glad that my boss is fighting for me but i do not want to be burned again.
