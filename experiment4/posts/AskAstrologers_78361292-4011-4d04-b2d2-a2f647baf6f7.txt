Rant/Q
Mini rant/question: 
Rant: 
Whenever my coworkers start talking about astrology they ask me to do natal chart readings for them (for free of course). They always gas me up like “You should get paid
for this” and then don’t pay me! I do it for the love anyways. I’ll never forget when I did a reading for a coworker who didn’t talk much about his family to me, but I looked at his third house and said “You have two brothers, one of them is uptight and the other is a dick” and he looked at me like I was a witch! 

Question: 
We were talking about rising signs and how I’ve heard that whatever your rising sign is, you tend to attract sun signs competitors. I meet a lot of Leos who always try to see who can come up with wildest jokes/roasts. I love Leos though, I usually let them out joke me, because I have sun 12th house. I was wondering what other peoples experiences were with this? Do you make friends with your rising, enemies, frenemies?!
