People act like jobs are everywhere but it’s so fucking hard to get hired. I can’t even get a cashier job with 3 years of experience. Why?
I’ve been unemployed for the past few months. I have an associates degree with a focus in business. I’ve had several customer service related jobs as a pharmacy tech, cashier and dog walker. Yet, I can’t find work anywhere. Applied to Aldi and even with 3 years of experience, I got a rejection email saying they’ve decided to pursue other candidates. I’ve applied to similar jobs with no updates. 

It’s like if you don’t have proper connections or extensive experience in a field, it’s nearly impossible to get hired anywhere. I have a pretty solid resume. I just don’t get why I can’t find work in one of the biggest cities in the U.S.
