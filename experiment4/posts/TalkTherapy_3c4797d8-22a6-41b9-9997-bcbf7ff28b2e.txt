Vodeo call therapy sessions have helped me out so much
I have agoraphobia as well as a bunch of other issues with anxiety. Honestly, I could never get any progress done with in-person therapy sessions. I would panic getting to the clinic and spend the rest of my therapy session trying to calm down. I couldn't even dive into some deeper topics revolving around the inner workings of my mental health. I literally left my previous therapist by storming out the door in a panic, never to return.

I started seeing a new therapist a few months ago through video calls and it was incredibly helpful. I never have been able to connect with any therapist until now. I actually look forward to therapy and I feel way more driven to practice my exposure therapy and other forms of mental health care.

It helps that I don't have to expend all of my energy just going somewhere. I'm also in an environment where I am a lot more comfortable and secure. 

I know that a lot of people prefer in-person therapy, but actually I found virtual therapy options very useful.
