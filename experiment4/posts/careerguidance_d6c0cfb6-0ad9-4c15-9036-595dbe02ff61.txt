I’ve resigned from my job and now my boss keeps asking for reasons of my resignation. Should I be honest?
Because the main reason of my resignation is the attitude of my boss. I’ve been working there for 5 years and I can’t count amount of insults, disrespectful behavior, humiliations, etc... I love the job I do, but there is no respect for me as an employee, same for other employees working on the team. The last drop was when my boss started telling to another colleague how shitty my work is, talking very loud - I bet everyone in the office heard him, I heard him and I wasn’t even trying to listen. I couldn’t believe this was happening, because he never complained to me, and I even got a performance bonus week before that! So, part of me really wants to tell him and HR that this is unacceptable behavior for a manager. Other part of me knows his nature, and it won’t have any impact, he won’t change his attitude or get fired. So, should I really tell him what I think?
