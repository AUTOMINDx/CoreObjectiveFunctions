Shortness of breath
Is shortness of breath (feeling unsatisfied with your breaths, can’t get a deep breath easily) a sign of silent reflux or gerd? Been struggling with this for 11 months now and I have been through so many tests (anti anxiety drugs and asthma meds and lifestyle changes) but I am starting to suspect maybe it’s silent reflux. I have chest tightness and pain. And wake up in night feeling like I am suffocating. 
I have had heartburn a few times off and on over the years. I belch a lot after eating. 

I just want to know the cause so I can help myself. Anybody at all been down this road? Please helpppp doctor is just sending me to specialists I can’t afford all of this forever!
