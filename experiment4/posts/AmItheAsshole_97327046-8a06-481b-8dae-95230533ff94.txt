UPDATE: AITA for laughing after my sister implied my brother's girlfriend's dish wasn't good at Thanksgiving?

Questions/clearing things up in general first.

Yes they were actual raisins, not the metaphorical kind. They were just mixed into the mashed potatoes. Yes, my wife makes a side salad as all "traditional" dishes are given to immediate family members. No, my brother does not make anything, never has. Chelsea and John have been together about a month and a half at this point. The laugh wasn't a "hahaha" it was a "HA" just one very loud ha.

Alright, into the meat:

John is still mad at my sister and I.

I had a conversation with Chelsea a day after I originally made the post. I explained that while my original apology was genuine, I can understand that it didn't come off that way and that I really was sorry. I also said that I had no intentions to hurt her feelings whatsoever.

She explained that my brother told her to bring that potatoes, which she questioned because she is familiar with the traditional Thanksgiving set-up. The justification for that was him "wanting her to feel like a part of the family." She also said she was worried about none of us going for her dish and mentioned it to my brother who then asked my aunt to only display hers. Apparently she saw some kind of tutorial online with the raisins and just went for it. No it was not cultural.

She asked for some mash tips, and she was going right with her technique, she just panicked when they burnt and then added water which I'm assuming is what altered the taste. Then she added the raisins which we both agreed can be left out of future potatoes lol.

Overall, Chelsea and I are all good, and she will be coming to Christmas dinner.
