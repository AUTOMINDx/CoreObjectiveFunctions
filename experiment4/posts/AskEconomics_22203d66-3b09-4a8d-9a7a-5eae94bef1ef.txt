What Longterm Impact Will the Rise EVs Have on Gas Prices?
Something I keep thinking about is what will happen to gas prices as EVs pick up popularity. 

Will gas prices go down as demand decreases? Or will they go up as gasoline becomes more of a specialty product that fewer cars need, and thus fewer production and distribution facilities exist? Or by the time it gets to the point that EVs are commonplace will resources be so exhausted that prices will be extorbinatley high anyway? Or will it follow a curve of sorts?
