Do you ever stay up late cause it’s your time to just exist?
If I go to sleep then the next day is gonna come so much faster, but if I stay up late I can just exist and not have to deal with the world and I can just be in my little bubble. I don’t have to live, I can just exist, just be. Everything is quiet and calm and I have no responsibilities and nothing that I HAVE to do besides exist. The next day will come by so fast if I sleep and I’ll miss out on this moment of nothingness, and I’m just not ready to deal with the next day yet, I just need a few more hours of just being.
