DAE use their therapist as their "replacement" attachment figure?
I never had a good relationship with my parents. My dad was very angry, would yell a lot, throw things, self harm in front of me, and physically hurt me on occasion. My mom is/was depressed, and never really intervened when my dad had his angry outbursts. So understandably I'm fearful of my dad and don't feel protected or close to my mom. 

When I was younger, I was clingy to my parents and had some separation anxiety. That didn't last long. I became avoidant, and didn't really attach to anyone else for a long time. 

Then I started therapy. For whatever reason I get attached to Ts or other female providers that are around my mom's age. I think I'm looking for a sense of safety and trust. Then once I find a safe person I get *attached* and then my anxious attachment comes out and I get clingy and fear abandonment. Got that maternal transference üôÅ. 

I don't attach to males, in fact, I've never been able to open up to a male therapist as I'm fearful, maybe he would remind me too much of my dad? 

I can't tell if this is normal, or healthy? I don't want to be too dependent on my T. I know it's a pretty one-sided, professional relationship. I don't know how I can "fix" this. I don't want to feel close with my parents tbh, I feel like the damage has been done and can't be undone. I'd rather attach to someone else, or better yet not attach at all. I'm trying to be avoidant with new people as I don't want to get attached (fear of abandonment).
