Mother keeps emailing therapist
I have gone no contact with my mother for two months as of right now. My therapist contacted me and send a screenshot of an email from my mother. 

Good morning  [Therapist’s name],
I wanted to know if my daughter had an appointment with you. I am very concerned about her mental health. 
I don’t know why my daughter is afraid  of me especially since she doesn’t need of me in the economic part because she received scholarships. Does she love me?

Quite frankly the email unsettled me. Does anyone else have experiences with their nParent contacting them during no contact? This is my first time going no contact.

Edit: Therapist has not responded to her email, she asked if I would be okay with having her tell my nMom that our meetings are confidential. I’ve been seeing this therapist since I was 15, which my mom assumes I still go to her.
