I learned something in therapy a few days ago that blew my mind.
I learned that I’m not lazy or procrastinating something that stresses me out. It’s called avoidance because it causes me the same stress and feelings that the event that caused me ptsd caused. 

I’m not LAZY. I’m not PROCRASTINATING. I’m AVOIDING it because it doesn’t make me feel human, or happy. It just causes anxiety and flashbacks. 

So fuck you to everyone who said I was lazy. Live in my head for a day you dicks!  You’re cut off. 🖕🏻
