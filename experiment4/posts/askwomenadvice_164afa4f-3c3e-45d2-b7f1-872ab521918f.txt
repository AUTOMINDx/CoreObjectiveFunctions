Shifting from pads from tampons was a bit more trouble than i thought and im scared now honestly. What was your experiences with trying tampons for the first time and some advice based on your experience.
This is my first time asking a question but i wasn't sure if this is right to ask in this subreddit. I feel like this is nsfw or something??? idk(I feel like this post does follow the rules of this reddit but i apologize if it doesn't) .So I(19F) am thinking of shifting from pads to tampons and ultimately a cup because of how uncomfortable pads are plus using a cup is less waste and all. I bought a pack of tampons about a year ago and since then I've been trying to use them but it's just the most uncomfortable thing ever. The thing is that I haven't even been able to insert a tampon properly. I watched/read countless videos/articles on it yet when i tried it was no use. The tampon doesn't even get inserted and its too painful to try to push it in. With time it did get inserted, but sitting down or moving at all with it is very painful, which makes me feel like i haven't been inserting it deep enough. How far in does it have to be inserted anyways. Did anybody else had problems with this kind of a thing? How was it using tampons for the first time? Does some experienced person has any advice for me on what can work.
