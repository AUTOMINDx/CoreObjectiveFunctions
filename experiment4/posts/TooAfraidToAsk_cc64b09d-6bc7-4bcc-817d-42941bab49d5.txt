Will Covid ever end?
So I’m sitting here in my flat, in the UK, wondering when will this pandemic fuck off. This new variant is looking to be spreading swiftly and we’ve now been told from Monday we should be working from home again among other restrictions. Another lockdown is on the horizon if things get worse, I presume. I completely understand why this has to happen. I’m just left thinking when will covid end because it seems there is always a new variant around the corner. Is there an end point at all.
