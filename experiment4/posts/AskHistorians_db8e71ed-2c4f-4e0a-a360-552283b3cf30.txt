Meta question: why do so many questions here have a ‘role play’ element?
I’ve noticed that there are a large number of questions asked on this subreddit that start with a ‘role play’ premise, e.g. ‘I am a farmer in C18th rural Virginia’. Is there a reason for this? 

I have never come across historical questions being framed in this way before joining this subreddit, but see it all the time here. I’m in the UK and wonder if it’s a common way of asking questions in the US or elsewhere?

Edit: for anyone who frames questions in this way, I just want to make it clear that there is no criticism behind this question, so please accept my apologies if it came across in that way.
