Is there a general idea in physics about whether there will always have been a universe, even if it dissipates in heat death?
Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask!

I was wondering whether the heat death of the universe would completely ‘erase the past’ or whether that would just be the “physical” end of the 4 dimensional “growing/block universe” (if heat death means time stops). The block universe would exist statically outside of time if that’s the accepted model and I understand it right…

If someone drops and shatters a cup at coordinate x,y,z at some point in time, will they always have dropped that cup or will something erase the past (I get the impression physicists believe the past is real)? Will the universe not have existed some day?

Very sorry if this is a stupid question!

Thanks
