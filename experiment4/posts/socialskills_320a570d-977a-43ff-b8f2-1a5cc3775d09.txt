This one trick greatly improved my social skills
Think back to the last time you were ***competitively*** playing a video game. Perhaps it was a difficult boss fight, or you were playing against other people online. You were immersed in the moment, not a single thought going through your head. Your concentration was razor sharp. You react instantaneously to curve balls

Put this much concentration and focus into ***listening*** the next time you find yourself  in a conversation. Pick out small details. Take an interest in the person. Try to figure this person out through their words - who are they, what makes them tick, what are they thinking? Can you guess how this person is feeling by the tone of their voice? Take an interest in this persons life the same way you would for a character in a movie. Your social instincts will take over.

listening is only a means to an end. You must take an interest in the person. To do that then you must listen. To listen, you need concentration.

If you can ***focus*** at the same level as you do while playing video games then you will be able to to come up with questions and responses effortlessly. you will not have the spare mental capacity to doubt yourself and in turn let your anxiety spiral out of control.

just try to look physically relaxed, and maybe don’t rage quit if the conversation doesn’t go well.
