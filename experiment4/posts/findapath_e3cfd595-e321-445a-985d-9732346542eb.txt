What are some industries or career paths that doesn't require a college degree?
I.. used to be a "good" student until I wasn't. I made it through elementary and high school by barely studying at all. Now at the top college in my country, where studying all days and nights is the norm, I can barely hold on. I'm planning to quit school and would rather go into training or something else that I could build a profile on.

To tell a little more about myself, I'm 20M, halfway through 3rd year of college but still haven't completed any major course/units after my very 1st semester of 1st year. Basically, I don't like my current course, and I've lost every time allowance I had to shift to another course I'd probably like. 

However, I'm seriously lacking any life skills or just skills in general. I'm in a country where it's pretty much a norm to live with your immediate family/extended relatives under one roof for however long you want. Nobody's forcing me to get out or anything and I've been with my parents (with my mother especially) ever since. So basically, I'm pretty much living like a NEET although technically I'm still in college.

Enough about me, all I want to have is to be independent, and have some sort of financial stability. I don't have much money with me and all I've done for my finances is rather spend it on useless stuff or invest cryptocurrency. It basically doesn't move at all and if it does, it's downwards.

I just don't want to live leeching off my parents and siblings until I get older. I want to be able to learn a bunch of things and just meet more people along the way. If I can, I at least want to have my own place to gain a bit more freedom.

TL;DR : Title, and me wanting to be independent.
