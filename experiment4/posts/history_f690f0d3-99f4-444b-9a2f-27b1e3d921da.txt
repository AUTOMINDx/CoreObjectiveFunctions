I want to learn about history and I don't know where to start
Hi everyone and thank you for reading this.

I am 32 years old and have lets say a basic knowledge of history. I was in love with history in my middle school (actualy don't have those in my country but it's the same agewise), but had a horrible professor in high school where we litteraly didn't learn anything for 3 years, and in the 4th year we got a new professor.. but it was kind of late for that (although I did my final paper for graduation in - history, goes to show you how love for something doesn't die). I read articles on Encyclopedia Britannica, but I'm all over the place. I don't want to learn from history books in my country, because for the last couple of centuries were turbulent here and authors are biased.

Can you point me to a couple of books that would be great for starters? I'd like to go chronologically. Also, I'd love to learn in detail, and I don't care if it takes me decades. Interested in the history of the world.

Thank you!

Edit: I just wanted to say that you people are great and thank you for your advices! Sorry for some of my responses being long, I am just invested :D
