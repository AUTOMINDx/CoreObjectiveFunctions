Giving myself a break
I feel like with anxiety, we’re always taught to push through it. I’ve been trying to force myself to drive on the highway over and over. Each time it actually makes me more anxious about it. To the point to when I get to my destination I’m an emotional wreck about it. It’s interfered with work, school, home life and personal life. It’s unfortunate but I kept telling myself that if I stopped driving on the highway, it would make the anxiety worse. But it’s already worse when I force myself to drive. In a way I gave in to my anxiety, and stopped driving on the highway. But I feel a lot less anxious. Now, I don’t really know how to proceed.
