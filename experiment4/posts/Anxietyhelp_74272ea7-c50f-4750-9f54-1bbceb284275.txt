How to cope with anxiety?
After a 2nd hospital visit, I was told I have anxiety and was prescribed Atarax.
Please tell me I’m not alone and this is all just in my head. I feel like something is wrong with my heart. Even after getting blood done, and ekg and chest X-rays I’m told I’m fine. 
This feels so horrible and I don’t want to do anything anymore expect sleep to make the feeling all go away. I have 2 small children and  I can’t do anything but cry now because of how bad it feels. It feels like someone is always constantly squeezing my heart. I have to keep telling myself it’s not real, it’s just the anxiety and to breath. Is there any tips you can help me with? I want to be active with my kids again. I don’t want to keep crying and not want to do anything. Especially on Christmas. Will anxiety eventually go away?
