I unfollowed all the porn subs
I have a huge porn addiction that comes and goes depending on mania and life circumstance. 
Today, I went through and unfollowed as many as I could find that I’ve built up over the last year or so. I’ve been pushing this off for so long, but I’ve finally done it. I put my ego aside, and bit the bullet. 

Side note/question-does anyone know a good way to block porn on chrome/safari/etc for mobile?

Edit:
Wow. First of all thank you for all the upvotes. This is literally the most liked anything I’ve ever posted in my life so thank you all. 

Secondly, I appreciate everyone’s replies and have followed all the subs tagged in the comments! It truly means the world to have all of you support me as you have!

Thirdly, I suck at replying and will get to you all eventually. Please don’t take it personally 😂 ❤️
