Covid wiped my makeup artist career off the earth. What do I go into now?
Hi, friends!

I am a professional makeup artist, with over 10 years of professional experience freelancing on my own (weddings and such) as well as working for companies such as MAC, Dior, Lancome, Smashbox, and Tarte to name a few in varying roles, including management. 

The pandemic completely obliterated my career. The market for the retail side of my work completely changed - the job that I’m currently in (2+ years) literally changed my job title without even telling me from special events and artistry to “sales representative”. I discovered that gem in an e-mail.

I’ve struggled and fought against the raging tide of my career being wiped out for a long time, but I’ve finally decided that it’s time to move on. This is my passion and always will be, but all I can see when I work now is what my job once was.

I plan on continuing to freelance as I can, but I am not able to rely on that for a steady income to make ends meet. 

I live in the Midwest - working on major TV and Film sets isn’t an option for me.

So what is somebody with my experience supposed to go into? I would prefer to stay in the arts, or creative side of things, if possible. 

I have the artistry experience, area and staff management, and retail experience, though I would *strongly* prefer not to build a career in retail. I also have no formal degree above some hours of college education - I really put all of my eggs into this basket. 

Thanks!
