Can a loving dad please tell me their proud of me and they love me?
I know this may not be the right sub but I’m desperate. I have a narcissistic verbally, mentally and emotionally abusive father who has treated me with contempt. I don’t know what having a good father is like. Genuinely, I see videos of dads being good fathers and it’s such a new experience for me bc I realise that that’s how it supposed to be. I just wanna know what’s it like for a father to say that to his daughter and mean it. Instead of constantly being insulted and mocked. Thank you.

EDIT: I just want to say thank you so much to each one of the comments, to all the dads, extra mums, cool aunts and big sisters who took the time out of their day to give me a random internet stranger a small piece of kindness I can’t thank you enough. You’ve made me feel like I’m your child too and it means the world. Your children are so lucky to have you in their lives. I hope your lives are filled with nothing but blessings.
