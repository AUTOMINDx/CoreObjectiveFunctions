Does anyone feel like their loved ones question your anxiety?
I have been dealing with anxiety for years now and to some extent I know that my friends and family see this. Often times though I end up feeling like they think I’m using it as an excuse or that it’s not real. If I have an attack or a breakdown it feels like they think I’m over reacting or that I should be able to just handle things the same way they do. I have tried to explain how the anxiety cripples me and how when I have an episode or whatever that I do not have the capacity to just snap out of it. Yet I still feel as if they think I’m exaggerating. It pushes me into a space of not wanting to be around anyone because I don’t feel understood, heard, or respected for what I’m dealing with mentally. Does anyone else have issues like this or suggestions? I’m at a loss.
