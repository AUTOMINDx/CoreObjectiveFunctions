I finally told my narcicisst boss that im quitting!
Over the 5 months ive worked for this company I have made several positive changes and a whole re-vamp to their phone system which didnt support work-from-home situations. 

My boss was condescending, manipulative, passive aggressive and just plain mean. I started losing sleep, brain shakes/zaps from stress/anxiety, not being able to eat due to constant anxiety, headaches and recently noticeable weightloss. 

I am sitting here now, finally enjoying a full breakfast for the first time in weeks.

I have 2 weeks left as a courtesy, but can say I really dont give a shit anymore - which was my problem in the first place, I care too much.
