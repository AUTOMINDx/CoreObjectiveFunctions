What does it mean when a shy guy ghosts you?
So, this guy and I have been working together for over a year now. We both just got out of relationships so we started talking in August, we had our first kiss on Halloween, and we’ve already had sex. This man was obsessed with me. Talking everyday, driving me home, we would make the eyes at work (but, keep it subtle so no one else would know). He just loved spending time with me. Well, the communication and the hangouts started to fade and I brought this up to him (probably shouldn’t have done since he’s a shy dude) but he told me he didn’t want to hurt me because thanksgiving, we were supposed to hangout, but hours went by and he didn’t come over. He told me that he was afraid he screwed up our friendship/relationship bc of that. I asked him if he still wanted this and he nodded yes so I’ve been trying to make all the moves to show him I want this because he’s extremely shy. I’ve been trying to take control like I invited him to go rock climbing Saturday which he said idk to, I brought him food, I even kissed him and still… there’s silence. We’re still best friends on Snapchat and his score doesn’t move so I know he’s not talking to anyone. I really want to make this work, but he is EXTREMELY shy and introverted. Any advice?
