I accepted a job offer and then my current employer matched it. Need to make a decision. Help
Long story short - I’m a Senior Graphic Designer for an internal marketing team. Job pays well and the team is amazing. My manager and the director of the company have had my back since I first started. I like my job and truthfully, I wasn’t looking to leave it. However, while I’m a Senior Graphic Designer, I’ve been wanting to switch to Motion Design given that’s mostly what I do even in my SGD role.

Then one day I was helping my friend browse for design jobs and bumped into a Motion Design job. It’s for an agency thats well known and I know 5 other creatives that work there as well. I applied to the job and they offered me a Senior Motion Designer role and 11k more. The benefits are sick, I would get $100 monthly allowance for fitness stuff and entertainment. Unlimited PTO, Company Stock, health plan etc. I accepted the offer thinking my current job wouldn’t be able to match the money, benefits and title. It was a very difficult decision to make given I love my job and my team.

To my surprise after I gave my two weeks notice my manager and director counter offered and matched both the money and title. They said that for now that’s what they can do to try and retain me and next year they want to make me manager of a motion design department but they have to push for it. I never thought this would be an option but the past couple of weeks my company has hired some people that keep wanting more and more video designs so I think the demand is finally here.

I have until tomorrow to make a decision. I love my current job and my team, but the new Job sounds better and funner. I don’t know what to do.
