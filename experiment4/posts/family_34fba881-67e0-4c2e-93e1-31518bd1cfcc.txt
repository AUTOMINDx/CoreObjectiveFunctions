Wondering if I should cut ties with my dad.
I (26f) haven’t had a particularly close relationship with my dad and his girlfriend for quite a few years now. My parents separated when I was 13 and moved on very quickly with other people. I get along really well with my step dad and Mum. They are super active in my life. 
On the other hand, I live around the block from my dad and his partner and they’ve been to my house 4 times in 6 years. Basically, the only way I see them is if I go around to their house. It makes me feel pretty shitty, especially when I see how my half and step brother are doted on. I feel like I’m just shoved to the side. 
I was invited me around for their big Christmas Eve celebration and when I arrived they had already eaten Christmas dinner and opened presents. It left me feeling so dejected. Do I just cease contact? I really don’t see the point in continuing a half arsed relationship when it just brings me more hurt.
