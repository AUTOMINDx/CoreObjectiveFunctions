Is it intrusive to ask them personal questions, too?
Alright I'm new to this therapy thing so I have no idea how to interact with my T. 

They always ask simple questions like "how are you" or "how has your day been" in the beginning, but I feel kinda awkward just telling them what has been going on in my life for five minutes. I know it's their job to listen, but I still feel a little rude to make it all about me. 

Another situation I remember was when we talked about my life plans and I really wanted to ask them how they chose to be a T, but then I thought maybe it was too personal.

So I guess my question is, can I ask my T questions about them, too? Would that be intrusive or weird? Or is it rude *not* to ask them how they are? 

I am totally overthinking this.
