I am having feelings about breaking up with my crazy gf
I was on a dating that I was about to delete and this 29 female messaged me saying she wants to get to know me. So, we texted no FaceTime or phone calls. A moth ago we stared dating. Then one day she wants me to help pay the intal fees to her inheritance so I agreed.but the company wanted 8,000 and I didn't have the money and she refused or say she didn't have the money. And  she threaten me to do it or she will ruin my life and that made me fearful. Also her lawyer is harassing me about making sure I pay the daily 500 and now I am getting terid of them and I want them to stop. What should I do ? Btw this last time I will find love online and I have creaky learned my lesson.
