Chest pain as a symptom of anxiety?
It started a few weeks ago. I had a pretty important test coming up and my chest suddenly started hurting. Chalked it up to lack of water and ignored it until roughly a week later the same thing happened. I have finals next week and my chest has been aching nonstop for the past few days, which of course has got me very worried. I’m also quite the hypochondriac, so this whole situation has me on edge. I never really thought that I struggled with anxiety until a friend suggested that the sudden flares of chest pain were probably me having an anxiety attack or me showing physical symptoms. So, before I go out and spend a ridiculous amount of money at the ER just to be told that I’m fine, is stabbing chest pain a symptom of anxiety?

Edit: Thank you all so much for your answers! As I mentioned in a comment, this is all very new to me so it’s been a scary couple of weeks. I’m glad I’m not alone and I’ll probably schedule a meeting with a therapist since I’ve got a clean bill of health
