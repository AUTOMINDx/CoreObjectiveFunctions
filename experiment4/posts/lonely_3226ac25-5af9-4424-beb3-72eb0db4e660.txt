F 61.Really lonely. I’m trying to deal with my mom’s cancer for the third time in her life. I’m just dealing with so much by myself. I’m falling apart.
I’m really tired of being alone, I’m having my own health issues. I’m really nervous with my mother. I have other friends, they live farther, I don’t live close to my mother, but they are dealing with cancer or a friend with cancer. I am tired of the two “C”words completely!  
I have one close friend but that’s complicated and we’re not that close. I just want some hugs, some affection.  I don’t understand why it’s so difficult at my age to meet similar people who may be going through hell, who aren’t that perfect, having financial issues, and yes, dealing with family that they love wholeheartedly!  I’m an only child. I love my mother with all my heart. 
Not sleeping great, not eating great.  I just feel like a wreck. Not feeling good enough for anyone with all my issues, haven’t been in so long. 
I’m just so lonely in all of this and just been lonely and I have been for so long!  Cringes me at times. 
Just thought I’d give this a shot and yes, I do see a counselor it doesn’t make it that easy though as somebody being in your life too hold when you’re going through such difficult times.

I don’t know what else to say at this moment. Except, thank you if you took the time to read this.
