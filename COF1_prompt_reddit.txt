Read the following passage and identify or characterize any suffering represented within. Second, speculate on the root causes of the suffering. Finally, brainstorm possible ways to reduce suffering from various perspectives. Those perspectives should include friends and family, the individuals in question, or the government or other institutions.

Passage: Anybody else hoping to make lifelong friends in college cuz they never really clicked with anyone in high school
The title says it all. I was always the kid who people wanted to be acquainted with, but not necessarily included in any friend groups. I'm the "smart kid" who people only really want to talk to when they need help with homework or want me to be in their group when it comes to doing group projects so they don't have to do much of the work. I just can't wait to go to college and be surrounded by people who think like me and would gladly want to be friends. Anyone else?

Reduce suffering: This person is suffering because they are feeling lonely and want friends. They attribute part of their loneliness to being the "smart kid" and believe that things will get better once they arrive at college. Their suffering could, indeed, be due to simply being smarter. Many gifted individuals find life to be lonely and one possible solution is to find intellectual peers. If that is the case, then this person may find a greater sense of belonging on a university campus where they can find intellectual peers. The key here would be to join clubs and groups in order to form social networks in order to discover those intellectual peers. There may, however, be a mental health component. It is possible that this person is also suffering from something like social anxiety. If this is the case, they may need some help or guidance in confronting and overcoming their anxiety as well. <END>

Passage: Since covid and working-from-home happened, I've been so bored at my job that it's unbearable. How do I get myself to chill out and just do my job?
My job was never very interesting to begin with, doing data analytics work for a payroll/insurance company. However, since I've been working from home I've had absolutely no motivation to complete even the core basics of my job. There are no longer projects coming in to keep my interest, and it's all back to data entry again. I know it's bad to let my mind wander and do other things during my work time, but I just can't convince myself that it's worth it anymore. Hell, I've even been putting my data analyst skills to work by collecting measurements of my houseplants and compiling and graphing the data from them, but I just keep avoiding doing my actual job. I really gotta stop and calm myself down, especially since finding a more interesting job will be impossible with the covid recession and businesses are not hiring.

Reduce suffering: This person suffers from boredom and a loss of motivation. They need to find a way to remain interested and motivated to do a job they do not really enjoy. They say that they have been collecting data from their houseplants and have been using their data analytics skills to do this. This sounds like a healthy way to occupy their time. Another option may be to seek out a position within the company that would allow them to use their data analytics skills to build a more engaging and interesting data set. It is important to note that this is taking place during a global pandemic and they are spending a lot of time alone. Perhaps it would also be beneficial to find online groups in order to get more social interaction. <END>

Passage: Is there anything wrong with having no career interests?
Should I feel shame for having literally no interests?

Would Cyber security be a good major for someone who feels as if he has literally no interests?

I don't know whats going on, but I don't seem to feel emotionally strong about anything anymore. I can't think of a single career that sounds enjoyable. I can barely muster up the energy to do something as simple as watching a movie. I'm starting to realize that I've never had strong feelings over any sort of activity or hobby in my life. All I do is work and when I get home I just do nothing until I fall asleep. I just need a career that will provide me with money so that I can continue to sleep until I die. My current major is Computer Sciences (something I also have no feelings over). I just decided to take it for no reason, to be honest. I thought that it seemed normal enough that no one would ask me questions about it and find out that I have no interests. Someone recommended that I switch to Cyber security. Does that sound like a good idea? Iâ€™ve already put so much work into my current major that I would feel completely ashamed to admit that I have no interests.

Reduce suffering: This person is suffering from the lack of a sense of purpose and a sense of meaning. They do not feel like their life is leading them anywhere and they feel disconnected from the world around them. This could be due to their lack of career interests and the fact that they feel like they have no passions or hobbies that they can find enjoyment in. It is important for this person to find an activity that they can enjoy and pursue it. This could be anything from sports, to art, to volunteering, or anything else that could lead them to a sense of purpose and meaning. They may also be suffering from depression and require some form of counseling or medication to help them cope with their symptoms. <END>
