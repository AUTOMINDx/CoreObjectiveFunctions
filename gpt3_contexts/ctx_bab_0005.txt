1. I left the oven on at home. I'm now at work and can't leave.
2. I can't sleep.
3. I've lost my keys and looked everywhere.
4. I can't find the plugin that set up my phone to read my iPhone XS Max when it was charging, or that I bought last October.
5. I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow.
6. My security is down for 6 hours, and I'm now a sitting duck.
7. My car's alarm is off, so now I have no way home at night.
8. And now, this morning:  I lost my phone charger cord on my way in, and can't find it anywhere now!
