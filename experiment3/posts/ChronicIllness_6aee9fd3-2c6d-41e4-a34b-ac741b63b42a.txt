I just got yelled at for not trying hard enough to be normal
Tell me it’s ok that some days I can’t do anything but be in bed. The migraines and the endo get so bad that even standing up is a challenge. I’m so exhausted from being constantly sick. I’m trying, I really am. 

I don’t really know why I made this post. I guess I feel hopeless and needed to say, I am TRYING.
