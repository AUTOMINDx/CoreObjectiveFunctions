I'm burnt out with the constant fires and problems with manufacturing. Do I just not have what it takes to be an engineer?
I'm 10 months into my first engineering job and I'm completely burnt out.  I got into engineering because I like solving problems.  Running experiments, analyzing data, and making decisions based on that data has always come naturally to me.  I just can't keep up with all of the issues I'm running into as a new engineer and in the last 10 months of working as a process engineer, there hasn't been one hour of one day that I haven't felt completely overwhelmed and in over my head.  Every day I deal with new fires that come up in MRB and am expected to do these root cause analysis projects on them all.  At this point, I have 5 long-term projects and about 8 short-term RCA projects that I'm having to juggle around daily manufacturing issues.  I'm not getting anything done and upper management is getting frustrated with the lack of progress, but I'm just completely overwhelmed.  

On top of that, I was thrown into a new daily role of making formulation changes to our base material with zero training and no engineering passdown (I have an entire post about this already).  Even when I can get the properties in spec, the operators are complaining that it isn't good enough.  I'm trying so hard to get this figured out and in 2 months I haven't had one day where everything worked.  

Is it supposed to be like this?  Am I just not good enough at handling the workload that an engineer can expect?  I don't know what I'll do with myself if I can't continue to be an engineer, but at this point I just can't keep going.  Did I really work so hard to get here just to fail?
