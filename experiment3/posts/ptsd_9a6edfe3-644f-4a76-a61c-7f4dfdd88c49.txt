Unable to Visit Gynecologist
Hi everyone, this is my first post. I hope I've followed all of the rules correctly but please let me know if anything needs to be changed. The TW here is for a brief, non-descriptive mention of sexual assault but I will also be discussing why I haven't been able to go to the doctor.

I was sexually assaulted at 18. I'm 23 now and I've never been able to force myself to go to a gynecologist. Every time my doctor's office tries to schedule one with me they emphasize how important it is and how it's something I "need" to do, which just makes me feel even less like I'm able to do it. I've taken it completely off the table for now and I feel okay with that decision.

I also feel like "female healthcare" is so out dated in terms of pain relief and informed consent... it really doesn't inspire confidence in me when I hear horrible stories of women getting IUDs inserted or removed, cervical biopsies with no pain relief, etc.

Has anyone else experienced this? Were you able to make yourself go?
