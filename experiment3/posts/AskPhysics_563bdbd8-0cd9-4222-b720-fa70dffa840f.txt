Why do stars twinkle?
This question just popped right into my head as I was falling asleep. Google says that it's because the atmosphere disturbs the light and makes it seem like it twinkles the same way that a coin in the bottom of a pool wobbles from side to side. I just feel like there's more to it and I want to know more about it. Help!! :&lt;
