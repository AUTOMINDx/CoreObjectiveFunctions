[Harry Potter] Why does Harry not care about how fucked up the Wizarding World is?
The new world of wizarding in which harry is put into has so many fucked up things like slavery, extreme torture, racism, an extremely corrupt government, etc. For example he doesn’t really seem to care about how Hagrid is mistreated for heing a half giant and doesn’t question how cruel Azkaban is. Even though lots of these things also have existed in the normal world, they’re way more socially acceptable in the wizarding world. Herminone is the only character who thinks that elves shouldn’t be enslaved, but everyone just mocks her for this view. Why does this heroic character see nothing wrong with all these awful things? Even if he can’t do anything about it why is he at least not disturbed?
