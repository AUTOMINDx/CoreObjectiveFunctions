How much does personality/geniality/general likability count in interviews?
Is it like a normal job interview where that's kind of a big deal once you reach the interview stage (I had a mentor who said it absolutely was because they didn't want to have to work with someone for 10+ years who wasn't easy to get along with), or are faculty generally keeping it in mind but more focused on someone's CV/ability to obtain funding/etc?
