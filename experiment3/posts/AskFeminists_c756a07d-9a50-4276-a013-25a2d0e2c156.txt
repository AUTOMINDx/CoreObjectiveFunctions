Trans experience on misogyny and sexism
I am well aware that this is a highly subjective and probably a bit problematic question. Please tell me if that is the case as I don't have any experience with this topic myself but I'd love to have a better understanding of it.

My motivation to learn about feminism comes from the fact that I've experienced sexism and misogyny my entire life. I grew up as a girl in a conservative area. This lead to me being very interested in feminism and learning a lot over the years. Now I notice quite often that when I talk to my female friends they easily understand things I explain to them about feminist topics and often they agree. Whereas with male friends it's a lot more difficult - they often don't even understand because they have never thought about the things I'm talking about or disagree by just saying that what I'm saying does not exist.

If there are any trans women here, how have you experienced this? Have you started to feel confronted with sexism and misogyny after starting to present female? What surprised you? Or was it as you expected?
