Are All Companies Slow the Week of Christmas?
I work at a software development company and review a lot of entry work, but this week everyone seems to be doing literally nothing. I’ve generally pretty efficient and get my work done quick anyway and then have.. some downtime. But this is so wild to me. Even my superiors. Is there like an in written rule?

Literally haven’t done anything all week. 

I work remote btw.
