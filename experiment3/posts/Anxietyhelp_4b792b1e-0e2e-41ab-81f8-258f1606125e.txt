just need some tips
I’ve struggled with this terribly for on and off for years. Always feels like something’s wrong, I’m doing something wrong, never trying to be the bad guy even if someone else does something to me. I’m always caring if someone won’t like me for me. I don’t get it, my thoughts are over whelming and it’s pretty much 24/7 every day. It drives me crazy. It gets lonely too because only certain people understand, others look like I’m insane. I’ve tried therapy, I have tried medications and I don’t like using any type of medication because I just find it getting worse every time I try something.. i have never had social anxiety as well and now I’m embarrassed to tell people I do because it came out of no where and I’m not sure how to handle it. I don’t feel normal
