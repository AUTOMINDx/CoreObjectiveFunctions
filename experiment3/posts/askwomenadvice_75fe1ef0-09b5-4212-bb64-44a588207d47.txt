I am just learning to cook and do other basic. What should I learn to do to be a good boyfriend?
I (20m) have been in a long-distance relationship for 3 years, and am getting to the point where I may soon be moving out of state to be with my girlfriend. Neither of us have lived on our own yet. I see posts on Reddit and other places often talking about bad boyfriends who never do anything to help their partner, so I wanted to hear from women about what things I should learn to be very good at, so that I can be a helpful partner who takes on housework/other chores.
