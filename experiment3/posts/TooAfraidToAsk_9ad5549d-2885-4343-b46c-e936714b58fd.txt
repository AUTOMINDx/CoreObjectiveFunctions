If you have sex with someone who tells you they are of legal age, but afterwards you find out they are underage, would that make it okay with the law because you thought you had consent to do it?
I would think it makes sense because if you have intercourse with someone you think is of legal age, it's not your fault if you later find out that's not true. Or?

EDIT: Why in the world is everyone assuming genders?!
