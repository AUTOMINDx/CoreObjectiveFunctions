How do you resign after 1.5 months without burning bridges?
Hi peeps.

27/F

I got head hunted for this role 1.5 months ago. 

During my first week, I was contemplating suicide because I was overwhelmed and there was a shock to my routine. I have both autism and BPD so it is hard for me to accept change.

I am very impulsive so I did well in my interview, got the job, accepted it fast and gave in my notice to my previous employers.

I didn't ask the right questions when I took the job, like WFH flexibilities to look after my family.

This job has been rigid and the people are nice but the culture is very different. I feel separated from my employers and colleagues, as though I've entered a really tightly knit group. 

I got another job that I have verbally accepted but I am worried of resigning and being hated for leaving so soon.

How would you approach this resignation? 

Letter first or meeting first?

Thanks for any advice you can give.

Edit: you are all amazing, thank you for your responses. You don't realise how much it has helped me deal with the difficult conversation I need to have. Thank you all. ❤️
