Giving myself and everyone here, permission to not be okay and to also not pretend to be okay
I don’t know if anyone else is this way but sometimes I feel like I need permission to do certain things, like relaxing and not people pleasing. 


This is what I told myself after working today and after having a bit of a quiet breakdown in the corner of a grocery store about Christmas. 

You have permission to not be okay. To not smile if you don’t feel like smiling. You have permission to break down if you feel like it and prioritize taking care of yourself. You need your own support right now. You have permission to treat yourself because you are worth treating. You have permission to say no if you want to. You have permission to not come off as completely pleasant and warm to everyone you encounter. You have a right to be in a really bad mood and not hide it. It is okay, you are allowed to do what you need to do to care for your well-being. I’m thinking of all of you and hope you are all coping okay
