What do you think about wages for housework ?
Lately I have been really interested in Sylvia Federici perspectives on wages against housework (she's choosing the word "against" in her work to elaborate her perspectives).

First, Sylvia Federici talks how women have tasked the work of "social reproduction". In a nutshell, nuturing future, present and past workers. Housework is the fondation of the work force. Basically the housewife doesn't get waged to fed, clean, care of the household. 

For what I get from Sylvia Federici 's work, wages isn't just about paying for the housework, but establish a contrat like any jobs and so having rights of workers (compensation, safety and ability of contest working condition...) and it should comes from the Capital.
Without wages, the housewife is exploited. 

From her perspective, the capitalism rhetoric leads women (and others) to look at housework as an act of love, it's a part of women's roles expectation. It's about gender and economic systems.

EDIT : Proper wording
