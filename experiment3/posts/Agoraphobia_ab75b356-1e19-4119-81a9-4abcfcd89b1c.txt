Progress
I made a post about 2 months ago that I was diagnosed with agoraphobia and panic disorder. My psychiatrist had prescripted me antidepressants. I can't even believe the things I am able to do! It's like a whole new world for me! I can drive in roads I always avoided, I can go everywhere as a passenger, I even started using elevators ! 😁 I am starting to finally believe that there is life beyond this!
