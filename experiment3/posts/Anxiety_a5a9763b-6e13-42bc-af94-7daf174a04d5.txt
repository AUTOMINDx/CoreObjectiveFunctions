What we don't realize is that the symptoms of anxiety still present themselves physically even when we are not in a current state of being anxious.
A lot  of us make the  mistake of  thinking that just because we are not currently feeling "anxious" that our bodies can not experience physical symptoms of anxiety. the scary part about it is that it can creep up on you suddenly, in the middle of laughter, moments of happiness, or even during day to day work life. So try and tell your self that some symptoms such as panic, sweating, short breath, increased body heat, racing heart beat, dizziness, change in vision, are all TEMPORARY symptoms that will pass by. It is just your body tricking you into thinking that you are in a state of danger when you really are not.
