Scorpio suns, moons, marses, risings can you relate?
People usually say we can get intimidating when we get angry or mad and when we lash out. Is it a common occurrance in your life that you get angry/mad and it's so scary that people don't even ask you or approach you about it afterward? They don't ask you but ask each other behind your back what could be the cause and you hear it. It's almost like the intensity is just unapproachable?
