Do you find anything wrong with traditional gender roles?
I don’t mean “expecting women to stay at home and take care of the kids while the men work,” but rather people who choose that lifestyle for themselves. 

Would you look down on a woman who became a stay at home mom versus a woman who became a successful lawyer with no family at 35?

Or a man who works long hours and doesn’t see his kids as often versus a man who stays at home to care for his kids?
