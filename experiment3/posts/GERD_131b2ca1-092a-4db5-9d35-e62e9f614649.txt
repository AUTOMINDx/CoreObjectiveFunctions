Does gerd upset the anxiety, or does anxiety upset the Gerd?
Ive suffered for a LONG time with panic attacks.  Every single one is accompanied with extreme bloating.  Every time the panic leaves ...the bloating does too.  I've tried SSRIs, Klonopin, etc...nothing touched it.  

This is literally over a decade, and at one point nearly took everything from me.  Now...I'm doing better, but yesterday was a brutal reminder I'm not out of the woods.  

My main symptom during a panic episode is gasping for air.  I'm breathing, never passed out, and my heart is beating faster than normal.  Sometimes crazy fast, sometimes just a little faster.  

It's embarrassing to be so bloated in public during an attack...like 4 times my size.  

I'm close to some Dr appointments that should help...but I've already had a bunch.  One Dr pinpointed Silent Gerd (used to be very painful but not anymore hence silent).  I lived with the painful gerd too long untreated.  Lost over 120 lbs 4 years ago and panic subsided.  Gained a little back recently and it's back.  Dr thinks that's a clear connection with gerd/reflux.  

He described it as a cycle that feeds itself.  I'm just curious as to if anyone else has the major panic issue with gerd.  If so, what do you do?  

Doctor said my "toolkit" actually might be making it worse...here is what I've done during an attack over the years...

1.  Walk around - can't sit still but also can't exert myself too much.  Dr said this is a good strategy... emphasized posture and NOT TO slump. 

2.  Carbonation - I drink it, burp, and feel better.  I ALWAYS take a carbonated water places i feel I might have an attack.  Dr said this is a BIG no no.  Said while the burping helps the mental side of "I'm getting rid of gas"...in reality it can make the whole situation worse.  

Do carbonated drinks make your symptoms worse?
