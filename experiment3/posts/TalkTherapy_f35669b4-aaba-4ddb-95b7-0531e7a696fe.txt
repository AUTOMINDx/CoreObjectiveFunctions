How do I choose a therapist when they all claim to specialize in every modality/technique?
Ok, obviously the title is a bit of an exaggeration, but not a huge one. I'm looking at therapists on PsychologyToday in my area, and it's like almost all of them just go ahead and check every single box they can. The list of modalities they use always goes on forever, and most of their descriptions claim that they have some blend of, well just about everything.

First of all, I'm suspicious, that many of these people have actually trained in that many modalities; surely if they're doing that many things they have to have a shallower understanding of some of them. Furthermore, most of the descriptions sound almost exactly the same, and are pretty vague. This is all making it feel impossible to make an informed choice about who to see. Does anyone have advice on how to proceed? Just throw a dart at a board and call someone?
