Did Soldiers take pride in their kill counts ?
This may have been asked before, but I saw a few tiktok comments saying that soldiers, particularly in the pacific theatre of WW2 liked to brag about their kill counts. Can anyone tell me how common it was or may have been for soldiers in WW2 to take pride in their kill count? This doesn’t have to focus on the soldiers of any one nation I’m just interested in a general overview.
