Would you continue to be friends with your Sister-in-Law if they didn’t put effort into the relationship?
For context, I’ve been married to my husband for 3 years and have been with him for 4 1/2 years. 

She’s always been pretty stand offish, and was even downright rude to me when we first met but earlier this year she apologized for her behavior over the years and said she wanted to try to be closer. I had my doubts, as she would leave me on read all the time in the past, but I decided to give her a chance. 

Ever since then, I’m the one who has been reaching out. She doesn’t reach out to me, and when she comes into town I don’t even know until she’s left that she was in town. ((Her and my husbands brother live 2 hours away)). 
When I reach out to her, I have told her I would love to see her when she came to town or trying to organize a “spa day” and she always says she will…but then I never hear from her. 

What would you guys do? I’m really at a loss here. 

Thank you in advance
