When you are dissociated can you move?
I usually can't, this has been happening every day since I was a kid &amp; I think its starting to really affect my muscle strength. Like I try to move and nothing responds. Or I try to come up with the thought to move but I can't think of the thought. And then I just forget what I was thinking about &amp; lie there for multiple hours. Is this dissociating?
