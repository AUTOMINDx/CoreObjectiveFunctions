As I get older my anxiety gets worse
Sorry in advance for this. I have never written in Reddit before and I’m not sure exactly what I’m doing…,just need to vent…

I’m a 31f and I realized that my anxiety gets worse and worse everyday. I can’t do anything in my life without it triggering my anxiety. I hadn’t realized I had anxiety until the age of 28. Now I basically realize everything. I lay in bed at night to sleep and quickly notice how “fast” my heart is beating. I had to buy a finger pulse monitor in order to show myself that I am okay. If I feel my stomach move, which is basically gas, I believe my stomach has torn open and I’m dying. 

I am not a drinker, it doesn’t appeal to me. Last night, Christmas, I drank with the family. I got slightly drunk and went to bed. I just woke up shaking (which is normal from the drinking, or at least I tell myself that) and my heart was beating fast. I believe this is all much normal, but I keep thinking I’m going to die. I can’t have any type of fun without this damn fear. I don’t go out to many places, I don’t do fun stuff because of it. As well as I have been to the emergency room more than I can count for muscle pain in my chest, thinking I’m going to die. I have had numerous test telling me my heart is perfect. I have a heart dr who tells me my heart is perfect but to me…I’m freaking dying. Again, sorry I just needed to vent because I’m not sure if anyone feels the same or has gone through any of this.
