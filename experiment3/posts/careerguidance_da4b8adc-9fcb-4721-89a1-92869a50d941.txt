Can I pay someone to get me a job?
I usually find recruiters working for companies who need to hire people. So the company pays them to find employees. I’m looking to do the opposite. I want to pay a recruiter to find me a job. Looking around online, this doesn’t seem to be a thing. Am I just not looking in the right places?
