Family ask me for money and say they have none but then buy my 11 year old brother a ps5 for Christmas
My dad bought me a phone for my birthday a year ago .I was so grateful because I had my phone for working and college work .My old one was so unusable .He said to me if you pay half for it I’ll pay the other half as it’s a present .I agreed as I pay for everything myself since the age of 16.I like being independent .A few months go by and he says I have to pay the full price of my phone contract and then he starts asking for £110 for rent as well as my phone so that’s over £200 .My dad begged me to send him more money recently as he said he only had £2 in his account .I felt awful so I helped him and now I only have £20 and I pay for my own food and travel to college so I’m going to struggle next month .Christmas day comes and they buy me some socks and face masks which was lovely but then my 11 year old brother opens the ps5 which they got for £580 .I was happy for him but they constantly refuse to pay for orange juice or my food if I want any but they will spend that much money on my brother .I can’t help but feel a little angry .My Brother gets spoiled a lot and he now has a laptop ,a phone ,an iPad and a ps5.
