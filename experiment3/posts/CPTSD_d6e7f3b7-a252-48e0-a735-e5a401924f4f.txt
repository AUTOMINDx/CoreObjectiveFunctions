Can you cry when you're upset?
I have some really bad days and instead of crying I push the feelings away to get through the day hoping I'll process it when I'm alone. Then I can't cry. It comes out in restlessness &amp; rumination. Does anyone else have trouble expressing and feeling their feelings? 

I'm also scared if I start crying I'm going to have a break down and can't cope anymore. Am I alone in feeling this way?
