Is it weird that i want to come out?
So i live in a very conservative country and lately i’ve been feeling like i want to come out…? Like def not to my family and just to my closest friend and some internet friend but not like explicitly say that “hey im gay” but more like send tiktok or sum or IDK MAYBE IM JUST BORED AND WANT TO CREATE SOME DRAMA OR SUM😭 but tbh if i came out i really scared that when i grew up and yk for some people coming out isnt an option and what if i forced to married a girl like what i cant even imagine how would they react, idk maybe im just bored but like idk or maybe im just want to open up
