I'm pretty bored of life
21 M here, I don't know where to start with this, but I just feel like life is "Meh". While I'm not in a situation where I'm at home all day, (I have a job and uni degree in progress, hobbies, etc), I just feel bored of it all (And waste a tonne of time when at home). Everything is just whatever to me. And I feel like mentally I've just been in the same spot for the last 5-6 years. No friends, no social life, no real happiness, and everything feels super repetitive and stale, and this is something I want to change for the better.
