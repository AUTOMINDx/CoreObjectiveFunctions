Found out the girl I’ve been talking to on Tinder is engaged…should I reach out to her fiancé?
I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this but basically the title sums it up. I’ve been talking to a girl on Tinder for a few days now and she seems to be really into me.

Welp I was able to find her on Instagram (she has a pretty unique name) and her profile is public with very recent pictures of her + her fiancé. 

I’m not sure what to do, I haven’t actually met this girl in person yet but I feel like I should reach out to her fiancé (he is tagged in her IG pics)? Or should I just delete her and stay out of it?

Edit: Really appreciate all the comments, going to try and get more info from her before reaching out to him but can post an update if enough people care. Want to make sure there’s not something about this that I’m missing first.

Update: well this got more traction than I was expecting so here is the update. I asked her if she is in a relationship and she deleted me…think that pretty much answers everyone’s questions. I am pretty much certain it is not a fake profile like some were suggesting. She said she recently moved to my city for work so my guess is she’s here without her fiancé rn. 

I already took screen shots of our convos before I asked her so I’m going to try and add the fiancé on IG (his account is private but I can see that she is in his profile pic) and send him the screenshots. Wish me luck.
