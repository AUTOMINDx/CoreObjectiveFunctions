How do I overcome nervousness during interviews?
I've realized that I get highly nervous during interviews despite putting up a poker face to my best ability. It's due to the fact that I'm so afraid of losing a great opportunity that I end up stuttering while speaking. It's really jeopardizing my chances.

To make things worse, I recently had my second interview at one of my favorite companies for an amazing position. A friend of mine also happens to work at the same company and knows the interviewer personally, so I asked him to get from him a feedback regarding my interview and he told him "He was good, a bit nervous, but good". I haven't heard yet from them and I'm starting to really feel anxious.

All the interviews I do, I never get the offer, and it's killing my confidence.
