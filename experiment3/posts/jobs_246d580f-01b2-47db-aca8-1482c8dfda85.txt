Anyone here feel that LinkedIn is toxic?
I remember the first time I created my profile back in college when I was majoring in business. I was encouraged by many professors to do so. I thought it was just social media or literally like a trophy case of people you encounter in your career like a portfolio. 

Years later as I’ve been in and out of different jobs and used LinkedIn as a platform for my job searches. I slowly started to realize how toxic it is for my mental health. I am not an active user who creates posts and engage but I sometimes go on it because I’m curious and job hunting. The next thing I know I see my peers or people that are around my age (mid to late 20s) having these higher level titles/positions. I look at myself and it makes me think “omg I am a few years behind in this career marathon”. 

It’s not something I noticed but now that I am in a career that finally set a new milestone in my life, I still time to time think my job title isn’t “good enough”. It just goes to show you the power of that platform even if you don’t engage- it creeps up on you! What’s your perspective?
