Is this a red flag ?
Hello everyone, I’m 22 and I go to college for nursing and I’m getting my driver’s license and I also have a job and I’m vaccinated 

however my boyfriend also 22 stated that his not going to college and he also doesn’t want to work.he has no interest in getting a license and told me his staying with his parents until we get a place together… he also doesn’t want the vaccine 

We live in nyc and since the vaccine mandate we can’t really do much together since I’m vaccinated and his not and I’m planning to move out of nyc  but do you think this is someone I can build a life with or is he just using me ?
