Why do men refrain from giving oral to women
I have always noticed in conversations with other men that many men or to be precise most men feel eww or refrain from performing oral on the womens vagina. At most they have kissed the vagina but i have found very less people who have actually loved going down on women. I was mocked sometimes in public by my friends because i love swallowing my girls juice. I have sometimes felt down and outcaste because people make fun of me. But as time passed i realised that if a women can without any shame take the penis in her mouth then why cant men. I want to know the reasons why men dont lick the vagina even though it creates such a magical bond between the couple.
