Is there a sub for people who are just kinda tired of existing?
Not a sub geared towards depression or suicide per se (though I guess it could feature), but for people who are tired of the state of the world, capitalism, the thought of doing a 9-5 for the next 20 years, etc and would just rather not be here.
