Do you guys have nightmares that donâ€™t involve your trauma?
I often have nightmares related to my trauma, but even more often, I just have general nightmares - I could be getting murdered etc. Just random, scary things happening in my dreams and it is very vivid. I wake up during the night from nightmares almost nightly.
