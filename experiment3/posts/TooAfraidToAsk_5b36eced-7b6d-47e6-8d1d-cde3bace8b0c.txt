How are girls supposed to act when they orgasm?
I like moaning a lot during sex, but this guy I was hooking up with told me that girls shouldn’t be that vocal because then how is he supposed to know when he’s doing something that feels good if I’m already making noise. He also said I seemed like I was overreacting/being dramatic when I came. 
Needless to say, I’m not gonna hook up with him again because I don’t wanna be with someone who makes me insecure of how I act when I’m enjoying something BUT I am genuinely curious if I act unusually or not
