Does anyone else find their viewing experience is much easier to watch &amp; understand with subtitles enabled?
And yes without being muted 😂

Edit: Oh snap, I've just woken up (Ireland) &amp; this has went from 10 upvotes to this!  I won't get back to all the comments, but it's actually pretty cool knowing that I'm not the only person who prefers it this way!

Everybody have a happy new year and keep smashing it with subtitles 😁
