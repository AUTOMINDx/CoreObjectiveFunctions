How do you deal with accepting your limitations ?
I feel like we all dreamed of being the next einstien and discovering the next biggest theory, but as I am closing out my undergraduate degree in physics and applying to gradschools I have a more realistic view that I am worried is limiting me. After interacting with professors who are incredibly intelligent, like mit and ivies undergrad and grad school along with being leaders in their field, it makes me feel ever so little. Some exams I do feel so difficult and I end up with a B+ in the class and feel like really that is my limit. It seems that no matter how much I switch up my techniques I get As in all classes but physics classes. I’m worried I’m not intelligent enough to really make it as a reputable/accomplished physicsist and I wanted to hear how you guys deat with having a realistic view of your dreams without feeling like you cannot achieve much.
