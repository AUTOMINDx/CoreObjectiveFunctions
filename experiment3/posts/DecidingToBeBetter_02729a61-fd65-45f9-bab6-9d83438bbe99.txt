I'm not going to kill myself ðŸ˜€
Boy ohh boy what a day.  Left rehab early with the intention of killing myself as I feel like a broken person who can't do the most simple of tasks and see myself as an utter failure.  I spent all day crying and ruminating on how I'm gunna kill myself but I persevered.  The suicide helpline called the police and they brought me in.  I got talking to one of them and he made me realize how much I have going for me and how intelligennt I am and most importantly to take it a day at a time.  I want to be a millionaire and get 1000's of YouTube subscribers but that's not attainable today and set myself up for failure.  

And besides that I stayed clean today!!! Despite some of the worst pain in my life.  The world is my oyster I feel great but let's not get ahead of ourselves it's still a long battle ahead but we got this!!!

So tomorrow I'm gunna make a YouTube video, do a 3k jog and do a meeting, I'm not looking beyond that.

I love you guys for giving me so much support when I said I was going to treatment it's such a polar opposite to the depression sub where nobody wants to get better

Wish me luck guys!!!
