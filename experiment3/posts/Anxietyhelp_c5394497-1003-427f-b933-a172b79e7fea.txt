How can I help my boyfriend?
I’ve posted on here once before about this and it’s still a reoccurring thing so I need further advice. My boyfriend (18) and I (18F) have been together for nearly 3 years now, at the beginning everything was okay and I never suspected that my boyfriend would ever be dealt the anxiety or depression cards but like most of us he was just last year, it all began when he started getting drunk nearly everyday for roughly 6 months, and he took steroids for about a week, of which he purchased from someone online, he started noticing that his body felt different even after he cut ties with drinking and the steroids, and ever since he’s noticed these changes he has spiraled into a severe case of health anxiety, he feels like everyday he’s going to die and that any &amp; everything he does will kill him, it’s become so bad that he can hardly sleep, he doesn’t eat much anymore, and he talks about having suicidal thoughts, since I live an hour away and can’t be with him 24/7 I informed his Mom that she needs to check up on him because he was saying odd things to me(suicidal, if you will). So she spoke with him and told him that she felt she should send him to a mental hospital to make him better. But to me this will only make it worse. Idk what I can do to help him or comfort him and I try so hard but his family makes it very hard on him and me to do so. Someone PLEASE help!!
