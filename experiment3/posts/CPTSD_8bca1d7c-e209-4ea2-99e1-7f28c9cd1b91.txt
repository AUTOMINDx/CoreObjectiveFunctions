Custom last name?
I'm about to get divorced and I don't think I want to keep my soon-to-be ex's last name. I also don't think I want to go back to my maiden name due to abuse and neglect by my parents. Both of those choices make me feel like I'm someone else's property and under their umbrella of control because I share their name...

Is it cringey to create your own name? Is it allowed? Do people do that?
