How does an adult make friends in today's world?
I, 39f, have had only 1 friend since high school. And that 1 friend, we only hung out for a few months going to happy hours to talk. And, it was because she was new in town and didn't know anyone else. 

How do people make friends? I have a husband and a baby and only go to work and home to take care of them. People generally think of me as awkward and aloof. That includes my family, my husband's family, and the peolpe I work with. I'm autistic so yeah, I'm pretty awkward. 

Years ago, and when I lived in a bigger city, I went to meet ups, but was still never able to make an actual friend. Do people my age already have friends that they just kept from when they were younger?
