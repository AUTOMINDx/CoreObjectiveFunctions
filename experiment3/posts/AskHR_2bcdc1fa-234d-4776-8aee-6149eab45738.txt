[CA] am i screwed on my background check??
Hey guys,

I've just received an offer from a great company with a starting date that starts next month which is contingent on a successful BG check.

The problem is that my latest position in which I had recently resigned back in October still says '- Current'. I originally applied to this position back in october so I was still employed at that company but forgot to update my resume when it was eventually looked at in November.

This check is being conducted by HireRight and I intend on correcting that mistake on the actual application form... should I reach out to the HR rep about this error or wait and see?
