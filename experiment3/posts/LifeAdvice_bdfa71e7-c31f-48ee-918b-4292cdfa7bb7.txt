Just removed my wedding from my calendar
Engagement was cancelled a couple months back. It sucked yeah but I've been trying to stay positive. Been going to the gym 3 - 4 times a week and have seen some really improvements in my strength. Been socialising more and trying to fill more of my "free time" with work to avoid overthinking. I have good days and bad days, but today I was scheduling some events on my Google calendar and I came across the one I made for my wedding in December. Jus deleted it and I'm feeling so stupid right now. How can I avoid randomly jus feeling like cr*p when stuff like this happens? I'm jus so tired of my emotions fluctuating so much
