Coming to the realization that my greatest enemy is myself. No one else to blame for how things are except for myself.
They say admitting is the first step, right? I am writing this as a testament to all of you on this subreddit that I am acknowledging that my life is the way it is because of my choices and nothing else.

Now I'm not here to say my life is horrible, but there are things that I could absolutely improve about myself that I just don't. Whether it's because I'm lazy, or bored, or have no self control, whatever the case may be, it's a direct result of the actions and decisions I've made.

It's mostly things like, my employment situation, my education continuation, my mental and physical health. All these things I want to change, because up until this point I have just been indifferent about all of them. 

I'm not entirely sure how, or where to start, but I know it begins today. 

Cheers.
