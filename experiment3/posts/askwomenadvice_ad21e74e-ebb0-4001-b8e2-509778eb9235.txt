How to get hobby motivation back? Advice on enjoying things that aren’t “productive”?
Hi! Hoping to get some advice on the topic of enjoying or wanting to do hobbies again. 

I really used to love crafting and art, I was young and didn’t have as many responsibilities. Obviously I’m now an adult and work and do other tasks. But I wanted to make time for these things and find it so hard to want to. I get home and just focus on basics like relaxing and eating, maybe some chores. It feels draining to do a task and so it’s more so when it’s something that isn’t “needed” (I’m not diagnosed but definitely believe I suffer from depression but have been trying to get help with that) 

Has anyone experienced this? Or have advice on how to get back into hobbies or things you like doing?
