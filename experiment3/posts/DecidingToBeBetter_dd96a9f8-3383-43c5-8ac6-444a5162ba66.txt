I failed today and I'm proud!
I decided last summer to try and change my major at university from philosophy and political science to Software Engineering (computer science). I had a lot of work to do in order to get accepted into my new program.

1. I had to go back to adult high school and get my math credits (I did not take math in grade 12 due to the pandemic and other AP classes I enjoyed more)
2. I had to get at least a B in my Comp Sci course in my first semester.

And I failed at getting a B in my Comp Sci course.

I'm currently in a position right now where I gave it my all; I studied for hours, asked my prof for extra help and guidance, went online to find additional resources... but it still didn't work. As a beginner coder, it was difficult for me to grasp all the concepts. But I still tried my best.

And I've discovered a newfound drive in me and a newfound work ethic that I believe can push me forward in the right direction in the next coming school years.

As for now, I'm not sure what I'm going to do. But at least I can say I honestly gave it a shot and gave it my all.

Thanks for reading if you got this far :)
