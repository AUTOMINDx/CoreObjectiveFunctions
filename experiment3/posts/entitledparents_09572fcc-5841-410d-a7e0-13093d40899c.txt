Christmas covid
So my cousin (EP1) and his wife (EP2) have been extremely cautious about covid since the beginning of the pandemic because they have two young kids which is a good thing. We all made the plan to meet up for Christmas dinner with the expectation that, in order to protect their unvaccinated three year old, everyone would get tested Christmas day before they arrived. All of the guests did this and everyone was negative so we (about nine people) got together and had Christmas dinner outside and wore our masks if we went inside and I was pleased at how everyone was being cautious. 

During the dinner though I heard a few troubling things which I noticed, and should have taken more seriously at the time. The first one (I really should have gotten in my car and left when I heard it) was when one of the kids mentioned in passing how he'd had a cold in the morning to which EP2 responded, "but it went away didn't it." I got distracted by something else and the kid really was busy running around so I forgot. The other thing I noticed was how much time that same kid was spending out in the neighborhood with his friends. 

Long story short we all find out that both of the kids have tested positive for covid right as omicron is exploding in our area... I guess only their kids were worth protecting...
