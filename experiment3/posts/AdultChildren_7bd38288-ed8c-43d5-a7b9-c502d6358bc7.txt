I (24f) feel like there is no sympathy the abused
Hey all, 

I’m posting because I feel misunderstood. I’ve been abused my whole life. It took a huge toll on me and how I viewed the world. My world can be dark. But it’s safer this way it feels. Being abused has caused me to be very angry. In my anger I have talked poorly about my parents, because it hurts so bad. 

I try so hard not to trauma dump on people. But the holidays had been excruciatingly painful for me.  And my friend(28m) got so annoyed with me today. They didn’t appreciate how I talked about my family. I felt like confused because I thought you where my friend? Why are you mad at me? I thought you were on my side ? 

I feel like most people feel bad for my mom in this situation. They fail to remember I was the one neglected, and she fucked up? Most of my anger comes from living with my family, I will be moving out next month. 

I can understand it’s annoying to hear people talk about their traumas. But I feel like you don’t have to put people down for the pain they have. I’m working to change I just had a really shit year like no one could imagine.
