DAE feel uncomfortable around people their alcoholic parent's age + gender?
This is something I haven't really talked to many people about, but I started noticing in my early 20s. I often feel uncomfortable around men my dad's age. I do this thing where I either idolize them or I absolutely cannot stand them. I'm generally non confrontational, but I tend to butt heads with men my dad's age quite a bit, especially if they are in positions of power and don't know what they are doing, are overly cocky, abuse their power, etc. (ex: teachers). My stepdad is an extremely nice guy and we get along, however I have this problem with him on occasion. I think men who are 50+ just trigger me. Posting this because maybe it's a common issue? I'm curious.
