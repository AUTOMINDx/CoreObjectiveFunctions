Failed US Soldier trying to find a job.
Hello everyone. I've recently returned to my home town from the military. After spending the past 9 1/2 months in the military and failing two MOS' I was discharged with a General Under Honorable. Now that I'm back home. I'm clean, I have a TWIC card and I've been spending a large chunk of my time pursuing a career. I've applied at many locations and plants but they've all seem to come to no outcome. Just a rejection email. I've gotten with my sources and my resume doesn't seem bad, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong or where to go. I don't want to back to retail and fast-food like before I joined, and I know I can do better but it seems like with the amount in giving it, it's just not giving any results.
