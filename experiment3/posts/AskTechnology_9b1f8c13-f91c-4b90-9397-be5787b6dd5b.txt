Any recommendations for wireless USB from laptop to 3D printer?
I have an Ender 3 Pro set up in the spare room and would like to have it connected to my main workstation. The problem is that this would require about 40 feet of cable routed through a hallway. Are there any wireless USB transmitter/receiver combos that would work for moving files to the printer? All I can find are USB wifi dongles, but thats not really the right thing...
