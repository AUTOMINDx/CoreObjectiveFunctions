I'm most likely going to decline an interview because the company says they can't tell me how often I would have to be in the office. Thoughts?
I just view that as kind of ridiculous. I feel like an employer should be able to tell an employee how often they would need to work in the office. Do you agree? They won't give me an estimate either. All they say is "it's kind of hybrid".
