34 year old NYC blk male tired and ready to start over... Career and life help
34 years old, single , no kids and quite my job in May 2021. Was making just under 65K a year B4 taxes. I worked in the hospitality industry as union concierge for 6+ years. It's mostly customer service for the rich.  I have some college and just don't know what i want to do. I am living with my mother but i basically own the house. I pay most of the bills and do all the renovations. I have over six figures saved up and plan to live abroad for 6-12 months.

I have taken NYC city jobs exams that i've applied for and I've gotten a call back from. One job in particular, NYC train conductor $75K starting salary.  My issue is i do not want to work odd hours, not have and holidays off( I am coming from a 7-3pm M-F). Also, I am tired of NYC( lived in the same neighborhood  all my life), Just tired of the rat race and keeping up with the jones. My other issues is what courses or certifications i can i take to better myself when i get back into the work force?

My decision to live abroad comes from traveling and seeing many expats from the USA doing the same, Living and working abroad enjoying life. I don't think that would be a permanent solution for me but right now thats the only step i see in my future. I just need a little break to collaborate my life.

For any one that would like to ask. I worked 12 hour shifts M-F all through Covid and ran some non skilled side hustling. What ever career i choose next will be something i retire from.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to have kids in the future. Working M-F and holidays off with overtime on the weekday and some optional weekends would be my Ideal situation. I can work with my hands and I love computers. 

I was looking into Digital Marketing and Data Analytics. Looking into some Google Career Certificates  as well 

Any help would be ideal.
