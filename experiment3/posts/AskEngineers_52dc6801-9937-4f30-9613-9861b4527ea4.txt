Are there Mechanical Engineering Jobs that don't use CAD design (like Solidworks or AutoCAD)?
So I have recently taken a course in college called Engineering Graphics where we learned to use Solidoworks and AutoCAD. The teacher was absolutely terrible for the class and my experience here has made me want to avoid ever having to use AutoCAD or Solidworks again, if a career using them is going to be anything like I experienced in school. The teacher was awful at explaining how things worked and gave us very demanding assignments that sometimes we couldn't finish correctly. The tests were what were the worst. We were only given 50 minutes to design these ridiculously hard parts in AutoCAD and Solidworks and I never finished them on time.

I spent hours outside of class practicing the concepts and using the software but the class was still a ginormous nightmare. I did better in my math and problem solving classes and enjoyed them more than this class where we were learning a "technical" skill that is apparently "commonplace" in the engineering field. Sorry if this is coming off as ranting, I just need to get this off of my chest after my experience in here. I don't ever plan to touch Solidworks or AutoCAD again, but I would just like to know from fellow mechanical engineers, does your job require this software or anything related and do you know of any ME jobs that don't?
