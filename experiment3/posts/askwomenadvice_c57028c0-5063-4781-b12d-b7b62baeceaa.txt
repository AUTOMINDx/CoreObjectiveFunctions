SIL has been struggling to conceive a baby for over a year. I’m wanting to start trying for a baby but I feel bad.
SIL (29) and her husband have been trying to have a baby for over a year. My heart breaks for her because I know how badly she wants to become a mother. I F(25) got married to her brother about a year ago and I’ve been thinking about trying for a baby soon but me and my husband can’t help but feel bad for her so we haven’t started trying yet. Any advice on how to navigate these feelings or how to approach the situation IF we do get pregnant before her?
