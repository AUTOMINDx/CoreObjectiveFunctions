Does anyone ever feel like they’re just the background character in everyone’s life?
I don’t have a “best friend” and I’m not someone’s favorite person. Looking back on past friend groups and friendships I was always overlooked and I constantly would think to myself “my presence isn’t necessary.” It’s so upsetting. I just want genuine connection and I don’t know what to do. I hate this feeling. I just feel like I’m not important to anyone.
