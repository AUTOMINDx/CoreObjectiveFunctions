How do I (24F) get over my self doubt at my new job and connect with my coworkers?
Hi all,

Thanks for taking the time to read my post. I currently started a job in a pretty competitive financial field with no direct experience two months ago. I am the only woman on my team and WOC in the department. I'm feeling very anxious about joining the company even though I am performing because I did not major in the field that it is in, it is male-dominated, and I often feel bouts of crippling self doubt and loneliness as I navigate a completely different field by myself. I have a mentor who has helped but they have a life too and I don't want to bother them all the time with my feelings of inadequacy. Albeit, it comes in waves where one day I'll feel absolutely amazing and I know exactly what I am suppose to do in my job and another where I question why I was even offered the job.

Some of it comes from the turnover that I'm now seeing at the company but also that my manager has been mentioning that the other new hires have "extensive experience in the field." I've been asking a bunch of questions but I feel like my manager is getting annoyed with me so I've retracted from engaging a little bit. I was told when I first started to ask more questions, me specifically because I had "limited experience" in the field. I don't know. I have general knowledge of the area but I do feel like there's an assumption that I know nothing and that I won't perform as well as the other folks hired in the role. I've asked for courses and books to read and I'll be signing up for a course after I finish my current workload. I enjoy the learning process. It's just a bit stressful when you have to do it alone...and remotely at that. Any advice on how to build confidence here?

TLDR: Lack confidence as "the only" in a male dominated field with (not enough experience I guess?) Help!
