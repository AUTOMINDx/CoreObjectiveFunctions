Hey you! Yes you!
If you haven't showered or bathed in awhile, go do it! You deserve to feel fresh and clean! 

I haven't showered according to my regular schedule and I was feeling pretty depressed. It took me a lot of energy to get up and shower but now I feel SO much better. My problems aren't gone but at least I feel refreshed.

I feel silly posting this but maybe someone is feeling how I was and could use a sign.
