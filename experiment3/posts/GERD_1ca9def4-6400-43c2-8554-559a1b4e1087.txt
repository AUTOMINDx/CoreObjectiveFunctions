Getting endoscopy &amp; colonoscopy at same time?
Tomorrow I’m scheduled for both at 8:45 am and I’m so nervous. Mostly nervous about the side effects after.. like a sore throat? I’m fasting this whole day and I just am going to be so sad if my throat hurts too bad to eat tomorrow :(. And the morning after I have to work so I’m thinking what if I still feel groggy in the morning… I’m an overthinker if u can’t tell. Anyways anyone else have both at the same time and how’d u feel? I think I’m getting anesthesia so that’s good.
