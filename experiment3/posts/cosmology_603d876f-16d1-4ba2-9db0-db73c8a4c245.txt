Were we causally connected to places unimaginably far away in the beginning of the universe?
I'm still trying to grasp my head around the whole "if the universe is infinite it's always been infinite".

So let's assume the universe is infinite. Then let's take a region of the universe say a googleplex light years away from us. Since inflation and then the big bang, were we ever close to that region of the universe in any meaningful sense? If so, then even with the big bang + inflation, how could that region be so far away today?
