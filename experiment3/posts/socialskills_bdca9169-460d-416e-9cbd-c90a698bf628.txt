Unpopular opinion: I hate when people say I’m hot.
Here is my daily rant. Guys think that saying a woman is hot gives women power and makes them feel attractive. However, every time a guy says I’m hot it makes me feel like they are only seeing the physical aspects. Totally get that men are visual, but please use other words to compliment a woman. We like specifics and depth to compliments.
