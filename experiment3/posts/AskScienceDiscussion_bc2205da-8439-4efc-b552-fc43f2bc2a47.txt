Child's cells in the mother's body forever?
My sister had a baby a while ago, and yesterday she said that her son's cells are going to be in her body forever, migrating through her body. Could someone shed some light on this? Also any insight into the benefit of this (I guess if there was no benefit it wouldn't be happening). Thanks!

Edit: I may have effed up with the flair. but it looks like I can't remove it... Ce la vie...
