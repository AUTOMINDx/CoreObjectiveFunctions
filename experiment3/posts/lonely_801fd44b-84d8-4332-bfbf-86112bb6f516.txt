I'm so desperate for someone and it's fucked
I want to have a boyfriend who cuddles me, protects me and is always by my side. I've become so obsessed with trying to find one that it's become fucked up. And what I mean is I'm so desperate that I don't care about anything about men, including age which is the problem. I'm glad I'm self aware but I don't think I care. I just want someone, anyone. How can you even fix the mind of a person who wants to date fucking nonces, I'm disgusting. How do I fix this??? Fuck.
