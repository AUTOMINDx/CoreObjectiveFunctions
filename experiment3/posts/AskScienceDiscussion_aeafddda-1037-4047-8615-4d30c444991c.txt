Why is evolutionary psychology so controversial?
It seems not too implausible that at least some human behaviors arise because of selective pressures. But in my conversations with friends who study psychology, it seems like the concept of evolutionary psychology is largely written off as a series of unverifiable hypotheses that mostly serve to reinforce historical societal norms around gender, race, etc. To what extent is evolutionary psychology unverifiable, reinforce (harmful) cultural norms, and are there any well studied and accepted theories or models that are derived from studying the selective pressures on human psychology?
