“Wow what are you doing with a Bachelors Degree working in Blank?”
Because the jobs where I meet all the qualifications and have the skills they are looking for, as well as tailor my resume and cover letter to fit the position deny my application. 

They are instead likely hiring a family member with 3 DUI’s and a history of violence. Ranting on Facebook that nobody wants to work.

Ted talk.
