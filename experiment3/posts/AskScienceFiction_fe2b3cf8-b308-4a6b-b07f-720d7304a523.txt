[DC] When beast boy turns into a chameleon can it change color?
Beast boy rather famously turns into green versions of whatever animal he tries to shift into. With no exceptions as far as I know. So if he shifted into a chameleon would he be able to then change color to use chameleons camouflage? Or would he be stuck as a green chameleon?
