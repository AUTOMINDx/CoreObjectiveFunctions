Am I ever going to find someone who loves me?
I’m sorry if this post is a bit too emotional for what’s usually posted here, but it’s just something that always upsets me. 

I was diagnosed a few years ago and got very sick very quickly. I had a girl who I was close to, not quite a couple but not not a couple. We were 18, I’m sure you know how it is. Anyway, when I got so sick that I was practically on my deathbed, she just ceased contact. I went through a lot of trauma starting hemo dialysis, dealing with all of the effects of that, eventually getting a kidney transplant, having just about everything that can go wrong go wrong, and not once did she ever care. That really messed me up. 

I feel like with how sick I am, my only chance was for someone to know me *before* I got sick, and deem me worth dealing with. Not only that, but I’m still only 21. People my age aren’t sick like me. Even if they did decide to go with the pity pick, it’d be unfair for me to put that burden on someone. 

Idk, I guess I just felt like ranting about this. I’ve just felt so alone through everything I’ve gone through.
