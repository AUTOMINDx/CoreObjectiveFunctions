[Student:] Accidentally angered a DARPA PM and feel terrible. What can I do?
I was working on a project with my advisor and needed to get it approved for public release. My advisor directed me to send it in and get it reviewed. At one point I asked when they would get it done, and they said 2 weeks too late and suggested I email the PM to request an expedited review. They sent an email back and it's all good.

The same thing happened almost exactly, except this time around they got VERY mad and angrily called/emailed (not sure which) my advisor, after which my advisor says "the bridge is burned." i.e. we've lost funding from them for future students. He almost fired me, but understood I really had no idea.

I feel absolutely terrible. I've checked my email over multiple times and had other people look at it, and there's nothing wrong with it, I think the problem is just that I emailed a PM at all, they're like a higher-up.

Is this just irreparably up in smoke?? Is there anything I can do to smooth this over, or maybe get my advisor more funding?

Edit: The 15 day deadline is written on the form, but the contract manager basically told my advisor "don't worry we can get done in a week." All of our requests were a week out (his other students too). It seems that he didn't really explain the situation
