College is hell for people with anxiety
that is all. it's been almost 6 years of non-stop suffering and stress. especially during the pandemic when my professors went HARDER on me than before.

edit: for 2 years i basically didnt leave my apartment and did nothing but wake up, do homework and stressful exams, sleep (but always feel fatigued). oh and drink chronically. thats my life
