Can't Stop Burping!!!
A few months ago, I used to eat really fast and always have to feel full to feel satisfied. Now, even after small/large and healthy/unhealthy meals as well as consuming liquids, I constantly have to burp. These burps are not acidic burps but rather burps that are smelly (can taste the food that I just ate). Additionally, when I lie down in my bed even a few hours after eating, I'd have to burp a lot more frequently. If I do not let these burps out, my stomach feels extremely bloated and I would have to 1) sit up to burp or 2) I have to fart to let this buildup of gas out. When I am not consuming anything, I do not have a problem with burping. 

I am not sure what to do about this? Has anyone experienced a similar problem? Please let me know and give me advice!
