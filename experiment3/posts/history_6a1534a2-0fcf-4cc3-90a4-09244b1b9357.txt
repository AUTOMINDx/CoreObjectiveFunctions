Baochuan, how realistic could they have been
It's not just the matter of the length of the hull, that could supposedly be reinforced enough through seemingly superior (yet rather evasive in their description) Chinese shipbuilding techniques, the implausibility also comes from the sheer height and mass of the sails (and in particular the central one) which according to pictures is insanely big. I can't imagine anything made of wood resisting the wind pressure it can get, and the weight of the sail itself.

So any insight from you guys? Do you think or do you have serious articles on how plausible they were?
