I don’t feel respected by anybody
I grew up as the scapegoat for my mom and she was the type to relentlessly criticize us, put us down or humiliate us.

Now I carry those introverted, people pleasing behaviors into all of my relationships.

People feel comfortable laughing in my face. Talking bad about me when right in my face. Raising their voice. Being rude. 

It just seems like people feel completely comfortable being overly disrespectful.

Has anybody overcome this?
 
I feel so much shame, cowardly, and self hate because it feels like I never stand up for myself and if I try people don’t respect me.

So frustrating.
