26M looking to go back to university to attempt law school? Am I too old?
I graduated in Dec 2019 and now work for a bank. 

I really see myself working in law because I have a passion for it, I just never took school seriously when I was in university.

However after going through therapy and flushing my body from all the antidepressants and drugs, I really want to give it a shot. 

I have money saved up for school as well.


Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL OF YOU, Iâ€™m gonna take the chance and try it out.

If it works out, great , if not well, I still have a whole lifetime ahead of me!
