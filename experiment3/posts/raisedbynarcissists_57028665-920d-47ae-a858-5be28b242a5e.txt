Is anyone else just waiting for their nparent to drop dead?
I (24m) don’t really care if this is “cold” or “too mean”. My ndad is a walking piece of trash and literally one of the worst people I’ve ever met. My ndad is a bitter 86 year old man, and after all the shit he put me through I told my mother and sister not to call me when he drops dead because I won’t care and I won’t play the perfect family for him at his funeral. Literally the only thing that gets me through the day, keeps me motivated to finish grad school, and flee this shithole state is knowing that in the near future that asshole will die alone from old age or a heart attack or whatever and nobody in this family will miss him. (except maybe my sister for like 10 seconds because she was his favorite. Didn’t stop him from saying something to her that made her flee the state the moment she got her profession started)
