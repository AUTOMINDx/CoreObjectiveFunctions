I'm thinking of ending things
I'm 23 male. I live in Egypt, studying English language and literature at Cairo university. And those are "some" reasons for why l'm thinking of ending things.

My parents was insulting and beating me for as long as I can remember. My father is still insulting me. I never had friends. I suffered from bed-wetting until l reached the age of 12. So many nightmares that l wasn't able to sleep.  I was constantly bullied at school for many many years. Other kids used to make fun of me and beat me. My teachers also insulated and beated me as well as other kids.

And oh god, l weeped a lot.

I still remember l once asked my teacher in the middle school to let me go to the bathroom. She refused. I begged her but in vain.

Finally, l peed inside my pants at the class, and I had to walk from the school to my house with my jeans wet.

No one loved me, no one really cared about me.

I live with bad parents in a mad society in a cursed and forgotten world. What a lovely situation!

I'm 23 now, and I really never imagined l will experience in my life that huge amount of humiliation, pain, anger, regret, and fear. I never thought that you can harm a human being so deep that his wounds became incurable.

I'm trapped. I don't want to continue my miserable life and I don't want to die partly because death won't fullfil my desire to live a life full of love, peace, freedom, and safety.

I live with bad parents in a mad society in a cursed and forgotten world. What a lovely situation!

In short, life is awful and so is death.

Anyway, my life will come to an end very soon. one thing I know for sure is that l wish I had never been born.
