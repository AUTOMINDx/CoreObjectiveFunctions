History Vs. Anthropology for Uni?
Hi!

So, I wanted to ask the anthropologists of Reddit a question concerning subjects. I'm in the dilemma of choosing another major or minor for my bachelor's, and I'm planning to have it as a double major. My first is indigenous studies, but my second is either History or Anthropology. What I want to do in the future is work in museums, archives, or with indigenous tribes. As a backplan if all fails, I was going to be a social sciences teacher. So, what do y'all think? Is there much difference between the two? How far do you reckon I can take Anthropology?
