How did you learn not to be so hard on yourself? Despite good self esteem I can’t escape the inner voice dragging me down.
After every social outing, work presentation, etc. I find myself beating myself up for something I said, the way I said it, etc. 
I’m 31 and just want to live my life without this inner voice bugging me all the time. Any advice to move towards acceptance?
