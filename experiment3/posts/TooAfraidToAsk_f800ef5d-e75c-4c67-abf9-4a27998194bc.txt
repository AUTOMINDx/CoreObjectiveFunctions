Is it weird for me (25, F) put down a towel before sex?
Just…the above question. I get really wet during sex and I also have a really nice bedspread so I don’t want to have to wash it every time I have sex. Last night I ran and grabbed a towel and put it down before I started having sex with someone. I’m wondering in hindsight if this was weird since it was just a one night stand and not someone I knew well…
