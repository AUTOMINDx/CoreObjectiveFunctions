I cleaned my room, and showered today!
Hey there everyone. I came across a post on this subreddit about how this person cleaned/organized their bathroom, and I got so inspired by it. I want to thank you for being an inspiration for me. 

Okay so I cleaned my room, specifically my bookshelf. It looks so cute, and I have been drooling over it. I'm literally so happy right now. Then I took a hot shower, shampooed and brushed my teeth. I feel so warm, and fresh right now. I organized my bathroom as well, and cleaned it. It's a huge achievement for me since I haven't cleaned my bookshelf FOR YEARS, and haven't showered for like idk how many days. But yay! Thanks for reading.
