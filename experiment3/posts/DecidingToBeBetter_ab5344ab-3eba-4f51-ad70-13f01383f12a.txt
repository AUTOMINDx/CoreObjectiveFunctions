I just realized I’m not bad with socializing it was my low self esteem
During quarantine I felt incredibly lonely so after school was back in person I tried making friends with people at my school. I didn’t succeed so I believed something was wrong with me. Later when I joined a new church I thought I’d join a youth group. And it was there I actually made real connections with people. All I had to do was just find something outside of school. So I guess I’ve now discovered some things. I’m too hard on myself, I can socialize with people and my self esteem is low which will hinder potential relationships from happening.
