How much continuity is there between the Wappinger Confederacy of Mohican clans and pre Colombian New York Native tribes?
Particularly in terms of ethnic idenification and tribal political entities. (Not making any assumptions on Pre Colombian NYC so just using a vague term 'pre Colombian New York Native tribes'. To simplify what was the political ethnic establishment of the Greater NYC area native Americans in the pre-columbian age and did the Wappinger Confederacy or the Mohican tribes reside in those areas or are they remnants/newer arrivals or new tribal entities made from the descendents of pre Colombian tribes?
