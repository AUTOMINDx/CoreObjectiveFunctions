It's 4pm on Christmas Eve and my husband and I are wearing matching PJ's and watching cartoons.
Santa is coming and my inner child is finally getting what she wanted - a relaxing Christmas with no drama or pressure to dress up. Tomorrow we might have stir-fry if we're feeling up for cooking. It's our Merry Christmas. 

If you're not out yet, you will be. And you WILL be doing the holidays the way YOU want to. If you don't want to celebrate at all, you don't even have to. 

Please take advantage of this safe place. We're all here for you.
