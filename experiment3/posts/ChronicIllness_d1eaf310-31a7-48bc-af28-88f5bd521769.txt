"You're letting COVID ruin your life"
Has anyone else been told this by family, friends etc?

A friend is throwing a party tonight and I was initially thinking of going but leaving early and allowing for the fact I'd not be feeling my best for a few days afterwards as that's normally how I am due to sound sensitivity. However, this morning some friends who were also invited got a text telling them they had been at a COVID exposure site, to get tested ASAP and to isolate until they return a negative result. About half of them are following this advice and so are not going because they haven't got their results yet, but some of them have decided to go anyway without bothering to get tested and the host has said he's ok with this.

A little while ago in a group chat someone asked if I was going and I told them the truth - that I no longer felt comfortable because I knew there would be people there who had been exposed but were not isolating and hence did not know if they were positive or not. Thankfully a lot of my friends were understanding as they all know that I have health issues but one particular friend went off saying that I was being "ridiculous" and that I was "letting COVID ruin my life." I didn't give in, but I'm sure this isn't an uncommon experience unfortunately :(
