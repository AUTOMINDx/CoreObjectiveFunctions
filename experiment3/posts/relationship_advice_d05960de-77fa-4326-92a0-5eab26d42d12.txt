My (25F) boyfriend (37M) of 5 years has never told me he loves me.
Am I wasting my time? I’ve told him. But he has a lot of commitment issues. Sometimes I feel like he’s holding me back from some milestones (engagement, moving in, making future plans), but on the other hand, we are so happy regardless and I love him. Is this just a super delayed 🚩??

Update; Jesus, major truth bombs but I thank you all. I am going to talk to him in the morning and go from there. My hear is pounding out of my chest but I will try to wait until the morning.

Update: We talked this morning. It was enlightening because I felt like I was emotion-coaching a child the whole time. He was so uncomfortable. I told him how I felt alone in the relationship and in my feelings. He said he understands. He wishes he “was there” with me, but can’t get there. He said he doesn’t want to waste my time. He is sorry. And that the ball is in my court, that he won’t leave me, but I will need to leave him and do what is best for me and my mental health. He said he understands and doesn’t want me to waste the best years of my life on a “maybe”. That he likes me a lot, and loves spending time with me, and will be sad if it ends, but that he doesn’t want to hurt me. We agreed to bench the conversation for now to make sure emotions aren’t so high (I was crying bad) and then bring it back up soon. I’m thinking after the holidays to make that easier. I know I need to leave him. I know I need to move on. I know I deserve better. It’s going to be hard but I believe I can do it. I can leave him. Thank you to everyone for the kind words, harsh truths, and comforting DMs.


Update: I will literally re-read and reference this thread every day until after the holidays for the follow up conversation. Thank you so much kind strangers.

Update again lol: I can’t do the holidays. I’m going to have him move out before that. I must be free of this. Thank you to everyone.

Final Update: We broke up, I ended it. THANK YOU ALL.
