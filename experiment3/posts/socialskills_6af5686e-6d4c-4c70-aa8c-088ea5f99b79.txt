I don't know how to move on with the fact that I missed out on partying/clubbing/bars during my youth.
I'm a 30 yo male who suffered from social anxiety most of my life. I can't go by a day without being reminded of how much I missed out. I'm lost tbh.

Part of me wants to make up for it by partying hard in my 30s but part of me is adamant because I feel too old for that shit. Worse is that I have no friends anymore who I can go with. I have to do everything alone and it frightens me. I don't know how to dance and doing it in public scares me. I never liked alcohol but faced problems when I was 25-26 due to stress.  

I tried to make peace with the fact that those things are simply not my scene. However, part of me is envious of all the people who are having a great time at those venues. 

Honestly? I don't know. Should I just swallow the bitter pill and move on to other things (e.g. solo travel) where I can bury what I missed out on forever?
