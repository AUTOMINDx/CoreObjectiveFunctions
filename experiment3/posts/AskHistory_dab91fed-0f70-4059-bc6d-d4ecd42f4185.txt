what do you think about this quote about mao?
Had Mao died in 1956, his achievements would have been immortal. Had he died in 1966, he would still have been a great man but flawed. But he died in 1976. Alas, what can one say?

â€” [Chen Yun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yun), a leading Chinese Communist Party official under Mao and [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping)
