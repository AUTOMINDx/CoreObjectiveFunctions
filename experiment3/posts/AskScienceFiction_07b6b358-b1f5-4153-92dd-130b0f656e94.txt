[DC] Can batman learn magic if he wanted to? And if he can, why doesn't he?
I'm not sure if in DC universe normal people can learn magic. But if any mortal can learn magic with enough effort and brain power can batman? And is there any universes where he does? But also does batman have anything against magic?
