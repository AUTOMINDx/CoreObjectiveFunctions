I came out to my mom but she’s taking it too good ?
I met a girl this year, and came to terms with my sexuality. I came to visit my parents for the holidays, and I have felt bad because there’s this amazing thing happening in my life but I couldn’t talk to them about it. Today, my mom and I were talking alone at home and I just felt i had to tell her. 

I told her the qualities of this person I was seeing, and she told me- “ok I like what I hear but you’re hesitating, what’s the catch?” And so I told her it was a girl. She asked questions but told me she wanted me to be happy. That maybe this is what I’ve been missing in my life~ to be genuinely myself. She told me she has a suspicion because I always would advocate for queer folks and feel very strongly for their rights. She told me she felt I indirectly wanted to tell her. 

I have been with men until now, it felt nice to know that she didn’t invalidate my feelings. 

I feel weird because she was so positive, I expected a negative reaction because it’s the normalized reaction.

I also am afraid she’ll change her mind, I asked her to please not tell my dad or anyone else. 

Does anyone have any similar experiences or advices to this?
