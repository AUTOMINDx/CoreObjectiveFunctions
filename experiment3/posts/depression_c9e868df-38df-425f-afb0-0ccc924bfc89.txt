I can hardly get my brain to focus or learn new things anymore. Does depression permanently reduce intelligence?
About a year ago I lost a very large amount of money and ever since Ive felt pretty badly depressed. I have been rather unhappy since age 14 or so but the past year Ive felt a lot worse, I almost committed suicide. 

The most prominent aspect of my depression is that I can hardly focus anymore. Also learning new things is almost impossible because my learning mechanism seems to be 100% broken by the depresssion. 

I used to be pretty smart and a fast learner which allowed me to ace through school without any effort despite my shitty mental state. I always saw my raw intelligence as the ace up my sleeve that would help me go through life but now I think Ive lost my natural potential.

It feels like my brain is constantly foggy and its driving me nuts. It that something that will pass or is this permanent? Does anyone else have such symptoms?
