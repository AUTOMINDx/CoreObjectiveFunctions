Bought gifts for friends, didn't receive anything in return
So I bought gifts for two of my friends for their birthday, I spent about $70 each on them, and they both mentioned to me that they'd buy for my birthday ages ago 

They never did. But they bought gifts for their other friends and were quite proud to mention that to me.

I feel like I've been screwed over a bit. I didn't give to get but I thought it was an unwritten rule of friendship to always buy gifts in return for receiving gifts.
