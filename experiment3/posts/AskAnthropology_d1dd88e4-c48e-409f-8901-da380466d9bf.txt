Were hunter-gatherer tribes eat what you kill?
I get that there would be barter, reciprocal sharing, quid pro quo, and so on, and this would be heavily relationship/family dependent. I get also there would be roughly equal sharing within a small family unit.

But on the level of a small-medium tribe, to what extent was it eat what you kill/gather, versus a more top-down socialistic structure where each person's hunt/gather was taken from them and then shared equally among the various different tribe members by a central authority (e.g. a tribal leader)?
