I did something stupid (trigger warning?)
I’m sorry if this isn’t meant to go here I’m just fucked and needed to get it out

Hey guys, I did something really stupid. I slashed up my arm pretty bad and tried to suffocate myself. I had a really really low moment - something I’ve only hit once before and the only reason I’m not dead right now I because I had two friends calling my phone non-stop. Even when I picked up the phone I lied and said I was in the shower and everything fine. 

When I got off the phone I just wanted to pick up where I left off to end it. But knowing I’d just lied to them and they’d reached out I thought about how that’s crush them and I couldn’t do it. The problem is I want to die and I’m not scared of it. The only thing holding me back is my want to not hurt those around me… and even that is wavering.
