Is incest morally wrong?
I, like most people, find the idea of incest repulsive. But I don't really have any good arguments for why, other than it's just . . . Gross to me. But is there anything inherently wrong with it?

Some parameters: pedophilia is wrong, I think that goes without saying. So a situation with an older relative having sex with a younger relative, is wrong. 

I would also argue that procreating with a family member is also wrong, as the child created will more than likely be predisposed to be unhealthy. 

But if you take away those two things, is there anything morally wrong with two consenting adults having safe, non procreative sex, if they are related?

Please discuss

EDIT: Tbh this post was originally meant to farm karma so I could shitpost in a different sub. So thanks for the karma. But this actually turned into an interesting discussion. Thanks for everyone's input. And just to clarify, I'm against incest lol.
