How much is too much for a mother to be invested in her child's appearance?
25F here. My mother &amp; I had a good relationship. I know she loves &amp; cares for me a lot &amp; I'm thankful. But sometimes, she gets on my nerves, especially this year.

Actually, she's very concerned about my appearance &amp; weight. I have been out of my normal weight range for more than 3 years &amp; I'm trying my hardest to slim down. Obviously, my mom wasn't happy about it &amp; she told me, repeatedly, to watch what I eat, eat her food, cut back on cheese &amp; chocolate (which are my guilty pleasures), &amp; weigh myself in front of her.

I would happily oblige if she hadn't been harsh with her words. I understand she's frustrated with me not being healthy &amp; looking good. She also said women who are overweight are unworthy &amp; lose their value in life &amp; that's what she said to me. Those are her words. Not mine.

The worst part of it was when she said, 'Step on the scale'. I get very anxious as I know she'll either be very happy when I lose some or very upset when I gain some &amp; go on into a passionate speech when I do gain weight.

Her way of encouraging me was to use her words harshly. Constantly nagging me, berating me, &amp; pointing at my belly bulge. She felt if she was harsh, that would motivate me more. In fact, she said she wouldn't have act that way if I just do what she says. She would sometimes compare me to the other girls I knew &amp; be embarrassed with the way I look in front of them, thinking they'll make fun of me (although I knew they're not that). I bet if she ever saw the 'that girl' trend on Tiktok, she'll say, 'Why can't you be like them'?

I want to slim down &amp; be healthier. I really do. It's just that I feel like I'm accomplishing my mom's goals when it should be me all along.
