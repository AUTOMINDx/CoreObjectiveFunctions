Phone interview!
Tomorrow I have an hour short zoom interview  for my dream position. I feel pretty prepared (I think) but tell me….how do folks screw up these short interviews? Do they really matter that much?

Edit: I think it went pretty well! Not sure if I blew them away but I was succinct, specific and shared my vision. Thanks for all your advice! Now for 3 weeks of waiting to find out if I get invited for the in person…
