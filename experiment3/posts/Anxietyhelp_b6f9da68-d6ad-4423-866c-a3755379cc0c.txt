Stetho-therapy
I wanted to share what helps my anxiety. Back in June I got a Littmann Classic III Stethoscope and it really calms me down and grounds me to listen to my heart. The feeling of it on my chest also calms me. Just holding my stethoscope in my hand calms me too. I also have autism, my stethoscope is very therapeutic for me. Whenever I feel stressed, I grab it and it calms me down! I came up with the term Stetho-Therapy or Stethoscope Therapy myself! Iâ€™m hoping this can help someone else that has anxiety, PTSD, or Autism too!
