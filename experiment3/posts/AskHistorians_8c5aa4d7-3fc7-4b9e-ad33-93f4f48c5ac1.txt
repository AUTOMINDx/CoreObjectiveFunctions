What the heck was Dr. Bronner talking about on the soap label? Was any of it rooted in fact?
There’s a pretty famous brand of “new age” liquid soap in the US called Dr. Bronner’s.  The label has since been changed (to sell their book), but for a very long time the label was end-to-end text that was, and I know I’m being blunt here, totally crazy.  There’s “quotes” from Muhammad, Abraham, and lots of anecdotes that seem to be rooted in early Abrahamic religious lore.  There are also some outlandish facts about Dr. Bronner himself.  Is any of this accurate or true?
