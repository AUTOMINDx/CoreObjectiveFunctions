Do narcissists apologize?
I've been wracking my brain trying to remember a single time my nmom has ever apologized, and I literally can't imagine a genuine apology from her. 

The one "exception" is when I was a kid and would apologize to her for something that wasn't my fault just so she would stop giving me the days-long silent treatment, and she would say "me too." As in, "I am also sorry that you did that thing to me," NOT apologizing for her behavior but my own.

Has anyone here ever gotten a genuine apology from their nparent? Or is that too much to hope for?
