Is it possible to determine the time period that the Vedic religion and the Vedic Invaders themselves mixed with the Native Indian religion?
Are there any genetic or theological studies that show where the cutoff   
point would be for there being a major separation between the Vedic   
Invaders  and the Indian Natives?
