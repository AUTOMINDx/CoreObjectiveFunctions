Vaccinated (25F) tested positive for COVID and was prescribed Ivermectin unprompted???
As the post title says, my wife and I seem to have COVID, and the doctor prescribed Ivermectin for us. Everything I can find surrounding research for Ivermectin use to treat COVID says it doesn't work. Is it safe to ignore this prescription?

Edit: Sliding into my DMs to let me know you think the FDA and CDC are full of shit is not going to change my opinion. Step outside your echo chamber. Ivermectin is proven to not work, I was just hesitant to ignore a prescription without consulting other health professionals.
