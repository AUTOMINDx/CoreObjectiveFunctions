What happens if you're exposed to a vacuum with an open wound?
This was removed from AskScience for some reason, so if it helps, I'm doing writing research:

I know that exposure to a vacuum generally involves swelling as the blood expands and capillaries burst, but one thing I just cannot seem find addressed no matter how much I look for it is what happens if you ALSO have an open wound. Say, for instance, there's a gash on your arm: Would the swelling cause this to rip open violently, would water vapor just stream out of it, or would something else entirely happen?
