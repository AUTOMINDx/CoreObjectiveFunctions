In Europe it was common for monarchs and popes to have regnal numbers (ex Louis the 18th), while in China and Japan they were hardly if ever used. Is there a specific reason these countries monarchs rarely used regnal numbers?
I know that Thailands monarchy uses them since the current Monarch is Rama X (the 10th), so Iâ€™m guessing regnal numbers are not strictly European.
