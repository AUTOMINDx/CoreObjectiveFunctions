Compulsive masturbation as a coping mechanism
My apologies if I didn't choose the correct flair for this.  

I know this is a somewhat taboo subject, and I've never felt comfortable discussing it with anyone else in my life, but I have struggled with isolating myself for extended periods of time and compulsively masturbating. I think this started when I was around 10 years old and it was pretty bad until I was around 14 ish. I still fall back into periods where I do this. This is somewhat TMI, but I've found myself doing it a lot this week.  I am sure that this is a way I have found to numb myself and cope with how overwhelmed I am. I have never been able to talk about this with anyone. I'm even afraid to bring it up to therapists because it makes me feel dirty and ashamed.  My religious upbringing has basically predisposed me to feel sexual shame.  Also, since I'm a female, I feel so alienated whenever issues surrounding masturbation/pornography get talked about because they're talked about as if men are the only ones struggling with it.  

So...yeah..I hope it's okay to bring this up here.  I have masturbated compulsively as a way to dissociate throughout my life, and it leaves me feeling empty and dead inside.  How do I navigate this?  I want to bring it up in therapy but am afraid to.
