AITA for not paying for my date?
So me (26M) and Kyla (24F) matched on a dating app. We messaged a few times but nothing really happened from it. Couple months later we see each other at a mutual friends wedding. We talk most of the night and have a great time. I ask for Kyla’s number from our mutual friend. We text for a few weeks and eventually make plans to meet. We have plans to meet for drinks and she cancels last minute. Basically 10 minutes before we are set to meet for dinner Kyla tells me something came up and can’t make it. I tell Kyla it’s fine and she starts taking longer to text, is short and less engaged. Eventually Kyla  quits responding and I move on. A week later she calls to apologize and ask if we can meet up again. I agree only because my friends new wife convinced me. 

Date comes and it started off rocky. Kyla showed up late saying traffic was bad. She brought up her past relationships constantly and it made me uncomfortable. She did apologize for canceling the first date, saying she was nervous. She also had multiple drinks and a shot. I only had 2 drinks. She was also on her phone, not the whole date but enough for me to notice. Things weren’t going well and the conversation was stiff. When the bill comes they ask how we’re doing it and I say split it. Kyla looks at me and says “I didn’t actually bring my wallet”. At this point I’m just done and says “I’m sorry but I’m not paying and I don’t think this is gonna work”. I paid my bill and left while Kyla sat there. My friends wife calls me that night yelling at me calling me an AH. I guess Kyla’s sister had to come bring her money. I’ve been called an AH by some of the friend group. AITA?
