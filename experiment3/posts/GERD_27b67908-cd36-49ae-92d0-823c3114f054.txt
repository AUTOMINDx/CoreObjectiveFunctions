Misery loves company. Thanks you guys !
My symptoms emerged when I was by my final year of Grad school so pretty much everyone, including me, assumed my illness was psychosomatic, and stress related. After almost 6 years of constant nausea and belching I was diagnosed with GERD in September. I'm still struggling with these symptoms, but finding this sub and seeing concrete proof that I'm not the only person unable to just "mind over matter" this situation has been‚Äç way more validating than the diagnosis. I've seen a few posts here remark on how isolating it can be to be sick so often. I've felt that way too, and so it's been really nice to have this little community that none of us wanted to be a part of. Anyway, I hope you all are having a comfortable, symptom-free morning. Edited for spelling.
