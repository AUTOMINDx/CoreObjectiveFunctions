Suicidal Friend
I have a friend who is very depressed and suicidal. He has counselling and I try to help as much as possible however he never seems to get happier or feel better. He refuses to contact a helpline. He focuses only on relationships and the bad things in a day. I can't seem to get him to understand that relationships won't benefit him. And I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice would be appreciated
