I made a lot of stupid decisions recently with men and I don't know if it was my fault or not (TW: sexual content)
I'm 19F and i lost my virginity a few weeks ago. it wasn't bad, i knew the guy (22M) for a few months, we didn't have an emotional connection which kind of sucked but it went a lot better than expected? I wasn't sad when he didn't text me again, I knew he had a track record of ghosting girls and he even tried to dm my roommate a few days after he took my virginity. 

but my stupid brain started missing him a week-ish later, and I hooked up with this other guy. he came over to my dorm room and it was really fast and unplanned, but I wasn't feeling it at all with him. I told him this but he kind of ignored me. i kept repeating to get off and i started pushing his shoulders, but he just ignored me and i kind of dissociated after that but i can gather that what happened wasn't good

i was going to give myself a break from "men" and sex after all that, but guy #1 saw me studying in the library and texted me basically saying do you wanna link right now. I just went and he didn't have a condom, and i told him I'm not comfortable doing anything without a condom, but he kept pushing and i didn't want to make him mad so i just gave up.

two days ago i texted him, literally just saying hi (bc my stupid drunk brain missed him), and he sent back this paragraph about how he doesn't want to continue or advance anything, but he wants to be friends

i don't know how to feel? a lot of stuff happened in the last two weeks and i haven't given myself time to process it, but i cant help but to keep telling myself it was my fault. i shouldn't have invited the second guy over, and i shouldn't have let anything happen without a condom. and i don't know why i feel so sad about guy #1 when i always knew he was a bad person. I'm just feeling a lot rn and don't know what to do. i still want to text him, i don't know why
