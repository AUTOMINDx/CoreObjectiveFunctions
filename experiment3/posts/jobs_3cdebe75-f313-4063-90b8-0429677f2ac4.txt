Workplace Violence Complaint
My coworker was physically assaulted at work (grabbed and left major bruises on her arm). She is now not allowed to work until the investigation is complete (makes sense to me)……. BUT the accused is allowed to work?

How is that fair? Am I overreacting? I am the only witness to this incident, and I am expected to work with the accused? Seems ethically and morally wrong to me.
