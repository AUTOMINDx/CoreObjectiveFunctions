I went to the dentist for the first time in five years thanks to this sub, and it wasn't too bad
My depression manifests the most in my oral hygiene. I barely brush my teeth and never floss. My gums receded pretty bad and I thought I was too far gone to get help. But I told them at the start that I was very anxious (verge of tears, hyperventilating) and they were very kind and non judgemental. I have 12 cavities but no periodontal disease or gingivitis or root canals. I have a lot of appointments to go, but honestly for me this was beat case scenario. 

If you're out there and as terrified as I was, please hear this: there are good people out there who will take care of you. It's not too late to get help, you are not too far gone or lesser of a person for needing a hand to hold through this. You are deserving of a healthy mouth and a good life. 

(You can do it, I believe in you)

Edit: it also really helped to have my partner in the room with me. If you have a supporter and the dentist allows it, I highly recommend it. Not having silence AND not having to make conversation was such a blessing.
