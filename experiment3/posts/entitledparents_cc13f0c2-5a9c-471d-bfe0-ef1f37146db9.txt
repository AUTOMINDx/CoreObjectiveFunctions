Even after physically assaulting me and my brother our entire childhood, our father is now pressing charges… against us
TW: mental illness, physical and emotional abuse

So for some background info, I’m in my early twenties and my brother is 16. Our parents got divorced in 2014 after many many years of physical and emotional abuse. 

For example:

- He used to hit me, pull me up by the hair and kick me in the stomach or the head
- he locked  me up for hours on end (I still can’t be in closed rooms or elevators)
- he threatened to kill us multiple times 

My brother and I are both in therapy and doing a lot better now, but since he still lives at home (I moved out 5 years ago), he still has to see our father (EF) from time to time since they live in the same city (in Germany).

I’ve been diagnosed with C-PTSD, depression and panic disorder. I’ve been having severe anxiety for years and my brother has depression as well and was suicidal for 2 years. EF still continues to send us mails and letters to my brother (he doesn’t know where I live so he can’t send me letters). I’ve blocked him everywhere, but his mails still get in my spam folder. He wants to get in contact with us even though we don’t want to. He used to threaten me that he won’t pay child support for me or my brother if we don’t talk to him. I had to take 2 jobs on top of studying full-time just to support myself (my mother didn’t really care)

My mother decided to press charges against my father last year. Yes, last year. Not when it happened, not shortly after, last year. We don’t get along well. But this isn’t about her.

Now EF decided to threaten my mothers new boyfriend, because he wanted him out of the house which EF and my mother purchased together. (She pays EF a certain amount each month because he can’t live there anymore, it’s some kind of “Nutzungsentschädigung”.
So my mother got it in her head that we could win the case against EF, because my brother and I are both in therapy and our grandma could be a witness to the abuse.

Well, in a nutshell: She got almost laughed out of the courtroom,the judge sided with EF because she didn’t have any proof after all those years and EF won the case.
Now EF decided he wants to get custody of my brother and continues tp threaten me via e-mail.

I’m so done with this sorry excuse of a human being. But thanks to my mother, I will have to see him in court soon and I’m so stressed out about it.

TL;DR: even after years of physical and emotional  abuse, my father still thinks that he’s a good person to whom his children should talk, now we’re in the middle of a custody battle
