im scared
so recently theres been a fight between two people one of which was my friend. and the principal called me and asked for info, and i told the principal who were the ones fighting out of nervousness. i felt guilty and told him about it, i constantly apologized and he eventually just left me on seen. i feel really bad, and im also worried hes gonna beat me up (and im gonna be honest, im a terrible fighter) any advice?
