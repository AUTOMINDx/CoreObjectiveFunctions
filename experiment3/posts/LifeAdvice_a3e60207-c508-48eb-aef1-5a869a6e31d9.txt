How do I confront my sister/roommate about dirty dishes
My older sister has a bad habit of leaving dirty dishes in her room for weeks at a time and then will move them to the sink (with the expectation of me washing them) so they end up sitting there for another few weeks. The part that upsets me the most is that I own all the dishes/silverware that she leaves dirty, it disgusts me and makes it hard for me to use after they’re finally washed. 

I’m not sure how to confront her about this issue, I’m a really anxious and passive person (which she obviously takes advantage of) and she’s a very hot-headed person who you’d have to walk on eggshells over.

Edit: I’m definitely moving out on my own when the lease is up in a year!

Edit 2: Please, any advice will help! I’m a stay at home mom who already feels small, under appreciated, and overworked, and to have to clean up after two tiny humans, my husband, and now sister is making me feel like I’m losing my grip on sanity. I feel like such a tool, and idk how to communicate this to my sister without it turning into a huge fight.
