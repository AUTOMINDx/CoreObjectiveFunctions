Sometimes death seems like a better option
Sometimes, i don’t want to be in this game of life anymore. I don’t have answers to the questions everyone asks. I don’t know if my career is a sustainable one for me. I don’t know if i can stand being lonely for the rest of my life and feeling like i can’t connect to my family. I don’t know if i can stand watching him fall in love with all those beautifully fit gorgeous intelligent happy women that aren’t me. They say things get better and i can make the right choices for me. What if my choice is to just end it so that i don’t have to stay in this cycle anymore? My family won’t have to worry about me anymore. And i don’t have to feel anything. No more questions to answers and no more feeling inadequate at work, around friends or with any person i love.
