What’s one thing that you want to tell your therapist, but you won’t? For whatever reason?
Mine is that I think about them and obsess and I think it’s probably pathological but my last therapist terminated me for transference so I’ll never talk about it again. 

Also, sometimes after a difficult session I’ll self harm.
