Do you find it hard to articulate your Likes and Dislikes?
I'm busy reading the book "Running on Empty" by Jonice Webb.

Part of it is to write down your likes and dislikes. I'm finding it surprisingly difficult to articulate.

Looking back on my younger years I was very much "go with the flow" and pretending to enjoy things I didn't actually enjoy just to fit in.
