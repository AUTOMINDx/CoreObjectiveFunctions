I want to break up with my fiancé when I’m on my period
This is not a troll post, I am serious. My hormones must be really out of whack or else my relationship is. Every month when I’m (26F) on my period I pick fights all week long with my fiancé (28M)and I contemplate breaking up. I would imagine that I’m the only person who experiences this ridiculousness.
