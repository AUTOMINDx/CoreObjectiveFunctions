When/How did you realize that you’re a woman not a “girl” anymore?
*sorry in advance if my question is unrelated to the sub*

So I’m turning 24 next week, and I still can’t shake the idea of me still being a girl, I don’t feel like a woman, yes I’m still a kid in some sense, but I should feel like a woman since I’m stepping into my mid twenties, is it normal to feel like this? Is this what quarter-life crisis feels like? lol

I’m the eldest daughter in my family, I’ve always been given big responsibilities, and I thought as a grow older I’d be given more/heavier responsibilities and (THANKFULLY) that’s not the case. 



Ps. I’m comfortable being a cis born female, in case someone thinks I’m having gender dysphoria lol
