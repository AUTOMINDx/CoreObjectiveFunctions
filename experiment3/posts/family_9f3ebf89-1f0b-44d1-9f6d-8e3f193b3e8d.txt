Son caught shoplifting:(
I am very devastated right now. We got a call from a cop and went to Walmart to pick up our 17 years old son. We was working there and now got fired. I am very heartbroken and feel that we failed as parents. ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­ He stole stuff for Christmas gifts and all the other stuff. Itâ€™s probably around $1,500. It didnâ€™t happen all at once. He was under observation and his boss just called him out about it today while in the store working. They reviewed the cameras and all the transactions he did using his discount card. What he did was changed the tag to cheaper price instead of paying the actual price. I am so worried about him and what it will do to his future. Please send out some good thoughts right now. :( :( ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
