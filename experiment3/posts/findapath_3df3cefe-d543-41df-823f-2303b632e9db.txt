Need to get out of Dog Grooming
Hi all! I’ve been a dog groomer going on 4 years and I’m looking to transition to a work from home position. 

Leaving dog grooming due to unrealistic expectations, desire for change, and some compounding health issues (31 with the back and wrists of a 90 year old).  Currently make about 70k and would like to stay somewhere near this. 

I would like to work from home as I think this would be best for my health and was wondering where to look for work. Prior to grooming I worked a variety of office jobs and I hold BA degree in philosophy. 

I realize I will probably need to invest in education in a new area. 

Any suggestions are welcome!
