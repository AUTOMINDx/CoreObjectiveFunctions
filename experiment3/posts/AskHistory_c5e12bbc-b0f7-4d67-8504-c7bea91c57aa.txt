How much of N. America did the Vikings actually explore?
Someone in r/ancienthistory posted a picture of a sword that their great x3 grandpa found in upstate NY. They said they had the sword examined and it turned out to be a Viking sword from about 900AD. Is this possible? I know they made it to current-day Canada, but to NY?
