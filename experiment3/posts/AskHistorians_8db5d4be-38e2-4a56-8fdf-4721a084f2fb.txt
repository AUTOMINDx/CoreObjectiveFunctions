Redditors! Marvel in the glory of your new mods!
In a time of darkness, in a place devoid of hope, a few champions stood between humanity and the galactic threat of the apocalypse of the forgotten past. Without these purveyors of the past, these archivists of antiquity, these reporters of the ancient record, half the population of the redditverse might puff out of existence with the snap of a finger. Today, three more heroes of history have joined the ranks of the Avengers of History! Those who would destroy the past will be naught but [removed] in the wake of their mighty mod suits.


Behold! u/Coeurdelionne rides into modship on a glorious steed slaying all shitposters before them. Carrying the Mind Stone, this mod enforces the appropriate use of sources by the various nefarious denizens of reddit.

Behold! u/snipahar peers through the stellar networks to pull all knowledge into its appropriate categories. With the Space Stone, this mod will shape the subreddit into an even more glorious form.

Behold! u/J-Force delves into the heart of users and ensures that their ways are pure of motive. Bearing the Soul Stone, this mod guides the heroes into appropriate action to delete any who stand in the way of historical knowledge.

The will go forth into all thematic clusters of Askhistorians defeating the forces of Historical Yahoos Doing Research Atrociously (HYDRA). As they join the Avengers of History, they will increase their power until no number of META posts calling for an “answered” flair will remain. They will lead us into a brave new world in which all posters use the search function and review the FAQ before asking “Did Japan surrender because of nukes or the Soviets?” 

Heroes walk in Reddit. What a time to be alive.

It is time to party!
