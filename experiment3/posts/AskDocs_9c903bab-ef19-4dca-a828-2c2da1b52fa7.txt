Doctor gave silver supplement??
14m

Went to a new allergy doctor as a new patient. The visit was great, but at the end she gave me an “Argentyn 23 Professional Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol 23 ppm Dietary Supplement” and told me it’s good for fighting infections. She sprayed it a bunch of times in her mouth and nose and said she even drinks it. She charged $30 for it. 

Should I be concerned? I googled it and none of its claims seem to be backed up by evidence. 

Also, she has a lot of plaques around her office saying “Americas Best Physician.” She also doesn’t wear a mask most of the time. These things are concerning, but her reviews are really good and she’s board certified. What should I do?

edit: she also does ozone therapy and that seems controversial too. she also has a laser med spa that operates in the same office.
edit2: she prescribed me prednisone
