I no longer want to be apart of my second family.
My parents are divorced. My dad remarried when I was 4 to my step mother. Eventually my step mom had kids of her own with my father. As I was growing up in two separate households going back and forth, I realized I never really wanted to go to my fathers house. My father was barley home and I’d only see my step mom and sisters.

I’m currently 24 years old and internally struggling with the mental/emotional abuse I endured as a child. As you could imagine I was not the favorite child. I was always the butt of every joke, teased about for my grades. I could never bring friends over because my step mom was cruel to them. The punishments she gave me were unruly. The manipulation gave me anxiety. As a child I walked on egg shells. The only person who ever had my back was my real mother. 

To this day, I’m still the butt of jokes. I can’t go into my dads house without feeling on edge, waiting for my step mom to make a slighted comment about me. I think it’s even worse now because my two younger sisters join in along with her… I don’t know what to do, I’d love to cut ties but I still want to have a relationship with my father.
