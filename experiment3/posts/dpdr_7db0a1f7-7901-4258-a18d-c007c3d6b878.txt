Floating in my body.
To describe it I feel like a cloud. Like I'm floating inside my body without having a proper anchor in, making me feel extremely tired. Its almost impossible to stay balanced and focused ( I tend to zone out). Also makes me feel a sort of brewing  sensation in my head when it happens.

I would really appreciate any help in identifying what it is. I also intend to discuss this with my psychiatrist, but I am treated for symptoms and so I don't know if there's anything else wrong with me
