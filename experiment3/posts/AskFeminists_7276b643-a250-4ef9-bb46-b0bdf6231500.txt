What issues do you have with anime?
I ask this since I tend to get annoyed with how misogynistic anime can be. One of the tropes that kind of annoys me is when a female character is written to be nothing more than obnoxious to the main protagonist. I also tend to dislike the female on male violence trope and find it unfunny and misogynistic.
