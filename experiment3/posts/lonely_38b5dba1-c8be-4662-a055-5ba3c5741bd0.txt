51,Divorced, Crushed by loneliness
Not sure how to start so lll just write. Married at 30. Divorce proceedings began in Feb 2021. I moved out. Then Covid. Work went to remote. Now its permanent remote. So for close to two yrs Ive been living alone. I have friends but the loneliness is really too much. Ive no purpose anymore. I dont know how to navigate the feelings of hopelessness and that noone cares. Thats the short story.
