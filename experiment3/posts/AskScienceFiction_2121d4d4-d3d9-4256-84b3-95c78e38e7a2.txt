[NOLANVERSE] was Liam Neeson Ra’s Al Ghul from the start or did he inherit the title from the guy who died?
I always saw the nolanverse ra’s al ghul as more of a title. Like instead of the Lazarus pit the role of leader is passed on to the next when the current Ra’s Al Ghul dies. Is this the case? Or am I wrong here?
