Anyone brush their teeth only once a day or none at all as an adult?
I'm 24 and still struggle to brush my teeth twice a day.  It's just a difficult habit for me to get into.  I assume it's because of my living environment but I just wondered if anyone else's struggles with it too as an adult.

Edit:  Hey thanks for the advice, encouragement, and insults.  I am glad to at least know I'm not the only one out there with this issue. I'm glad to have helped other's out by making this post.  I will try my best to keep up on brushing my teeth now!  Hope those who don't brush them will do so now too.  Thank you again.
