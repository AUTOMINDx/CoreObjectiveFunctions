I want to talk to a psychologist. But I don't have the money
I(M 22) just finished my semester exams at college and I'm back home for the vacation. I have no friends here, it's very lonely. My friends are not responding to my texts. The weather is great here in East India. There are flowers blooming everywhere and I'm supposed to be happy. But I'm not.
