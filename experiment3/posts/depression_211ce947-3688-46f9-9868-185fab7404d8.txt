suicide
i’m going to try to kill myself by overdose. i don’t care anymore everything is so overwhelming. im 16 and can’t see a future where i’m happy and all i hear is how life gets worse after high school. i’m already stressed enough. i’m so unloveable and boring. i have a horrible personality and i don’t look good either. i hope i don’t wake up after posting this. the only reason im writing is to tell someone
