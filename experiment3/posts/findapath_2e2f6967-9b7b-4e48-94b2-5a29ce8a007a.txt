What careers, hobbies, or activities should I do based on these values?
I am mainly looking for some careers that align with my top values below. I am trying to build out a life vision for myself and I know that includes more than just a career. Given that my career takes up the bulk of my time, hopefully that’s a good starting point. 

I am 26M, been working a corporate supply chain since I graduated college and being remote has been tough as I am a social person. I really enjoy helping people out and talking to people. I also love to learn and love to travel as well. I have lead people in the past and that’s something that interests me as well. I want to do something where I work with a team of people, doing something impactful. I get lazy if I am too comfortable. If it helps my MTBI is ENFJ, and am I gemini.

Values ranked:
1. Curiosity
2. Passion
3. Health(as in taking care of my own)
4. Family
5. Adventure
6. Growth
7. Friendship
8. Autonomy
9. Compassion
10. Contribution 

Thank you for your time
