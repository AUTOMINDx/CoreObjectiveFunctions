My old bosses brother is accusing and harassing me over text. [NY]
This is a very long and complicated story and I desperately need advice, this was my last resort.

In February of 2021 I started working in a nearby 7/11. I got hired by my old boss named Mike. 
As months went past, Mike suddenly started showing up less and less until he stopped showing up completely. This was because his dad died and he landed in the hospital. As time went past, Mike’s brother and mother take over. Suddenly the night shift co worker got fired and I was close with this worker at the time so I asked him what happened, he said that he got fired for “stealing” when he said he never once stole. I have seen Doug come to the registers, take money and leave, same with cigarettes. That is stealing. After he got fired, this shit traveled back to me and now I am the one getting accused of stealing when I never once stole. I knew the cameras were there above and around me. I work to earn not steal. I’m getting threats and harassed non stop. And when Mike was around nothing like this ever happened. Doug has fired 3 people for his own disgusting behavior. He’s scapegoating on his fucking employees for his own Karma. I quit but the harassment doesn’t stop. 


Please I need some really good advice right now on what to do 😭😭😭
