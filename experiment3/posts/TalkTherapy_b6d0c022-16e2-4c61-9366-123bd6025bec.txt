T told me she’s proud of me. Does she know that’s how she becomes my mom? Because that’s how she becomes my mom.
✨Not another maternal transference post✨

If there is a feeling I wish I could bottle up and feel every single day, it’s the feeling I get when she tells me she’s proud of me. She sees me trying and putting in the work. No one has ever been proud of me before and coming from her, this beautiful human, feels so damn good. Just a gushing over my T post. Tell me something your T has done that has made you feel this way.
