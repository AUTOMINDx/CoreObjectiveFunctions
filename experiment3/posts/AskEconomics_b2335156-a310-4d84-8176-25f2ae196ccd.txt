How does Japan have so much debt without being bankrupt?
Just looking at lists of national debt to GDP ratios, and the ones with the highest ratio are generally countries who are really not doing well with the exception of Japan.  It's up there or above countries like Venezuela, Greece, Sudan, and various other places who are on the brink of bankruptcy, revolution or civil war.  Am I just not aware of how bad things are in Japan?
