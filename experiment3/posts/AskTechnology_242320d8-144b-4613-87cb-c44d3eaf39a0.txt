Why didn’t a Switch-like game console happen sooner?
The idea of a handheld game console that can also plug into a TV seems obvious, and I have to imagine the Switch is not the first time someone had that idea. The Wii U tablet had some standalone uses, and I know the PSP and other handhelds have had A/V cables. But why did it take so long for a console to be designed with this as a primary feature? 

My first instinct is hardware limitations; I would understand if the right balance of size, performance, cost, and battery life just couldn’t be achieved sooner. But are there other reasons I may be missing, and are there any notable failed attempts at the hybrid console concept?
