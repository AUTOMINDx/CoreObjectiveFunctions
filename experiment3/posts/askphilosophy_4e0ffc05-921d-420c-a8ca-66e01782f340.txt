Possibility of psychoanalysis
Quite famously Popper considered psychoanalysis to be unfalsifiable. This does not really seem true to me and I'd like to see more on the subject, also because I'm very interested in the philosophy of health, psychiatry and similar things.

I would particularly appreciate papers that survey the existing literature or a monograph or a textbook, i.e. a self-contained work if possible, on the possibility of psychoanalysis as a science.

Thanks in advance!
