Multilingualism and monolingualism as cultures?
I got into an argument recently that suggested to my mind that multilingualism and monolingualism may be cultures or have cultures surrounding them that produce different etiquettes and values in their speakers.

My thoughts were that monolingual cultures demand that multilingual speakers change their language use to accommodate monolingual speakers (including, say, when the latter are the minority in a conversation), and it is rude to 'exclude' monolinguals through language choice.

Whereas multilingual cultures demand that monolingual speakers do their best to fit in with multilingual conversations, and it is rude to demand that others change or limit their language choice to suit oneself.

Is there any substance to this whether in these terms or from a different angle? If so are there some interesting literatures to explore?

I realise there's a political aspect to this, for example attitudes towards and of English speakers both in English-speaking countries and non-English speaking countries. I'm not trying to ask a political or moral question though, nor am I trying to use this thread to score any points for either 'team', just genuinely curious about the wider anthropological dimension around some of these experiences.

Fwiw I have a social science background but am not an anthropologist. I also grew up/live in a monolingual country but have lived in multilingual countries and am part of an extended family whose members split into three different first languages.
