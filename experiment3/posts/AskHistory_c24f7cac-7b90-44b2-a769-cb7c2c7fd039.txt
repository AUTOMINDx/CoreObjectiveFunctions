Has a banished heir to a throne ever returned to claim it?
The title pretty much summarizes the question. In literature or movies we often see a banished child return a decade or two later to claim the throne. Has this ever happened? If so, how would they prove that they are who they say they are? Has anyone ever claimed a throne that wasnâ€™t theirs by forging proof of who they are?
