how did we know about black holes locations
I've always heard something like: "there is a huge black hole in a galaxy 55 million light years away" , "there are 20000 black holes in a galaxy 12 million light years away" etc... before 2019, the question is how does nasa know about black holes locations if the first black hole seen was in 2019. 




P.S: the quotes are imaginary examples not actual real life facts
