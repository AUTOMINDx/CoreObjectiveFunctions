Guys I FINALLY did it, I asked for help after all these years.
I'm 22, and I've been struggling with depression and anxiety pretty much my whole life. I have a lot of childhood trauma and this year I completely burned out. 

I'm a college student but last year I couldn't  handle quarantine and zoom classes. All my grades dropped because I couldn't really focus or pay attention to anything. I felt so bad about myself that I decided to take this year off without telling anyone besides my aunt. 

Living with my mother is a pure emotional hell and she doesn't support me with anything besides giving me a bed to sleep and my dad can only help me financially.

Today my aunt (dad side), called me asking for the real reason behind my decision to take the year off college and I finally told her that I've been struggling since I can remember and that I couldn't handle college while lacking a good mental health.

She just called me again inviting me to move to her house while finally taking therapy. Well, thats it folks, things may start to get better. It takes so much to seek help but it is such a relief when you finally do it...
