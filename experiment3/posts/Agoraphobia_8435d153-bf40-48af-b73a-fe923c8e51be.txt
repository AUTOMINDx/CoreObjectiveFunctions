I haven't gone out of my house in 9 years.
I am a NEET and live with my parents but on a different floor. I haven't stepped out of my house in 9 years. I keep all my windows closed and I don't want my neighbours or anyone else besides my parents to see me. I don't even play video games or watch movies anymore. I sleep whole day and stay awake all night just living like a zombie. The only way I can fall asleep is by hoping I won't wake up the next day and I am gonna go painlessly. I am in my mid 20s now. Meds don't work. Counselling doesn't work. Difficult to visit the doctor when I can't even step out of the house. I get really bad panic attacks when I think how many years I have wasted and what will happen when my parents pass away. Don't have the courage to end my life. I don't want to / can't seem to do anything.
