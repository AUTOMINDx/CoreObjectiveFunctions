Don’t want to give two weeks notice
I basically have a job lined up. I am returning to my old job with a higher pay and more flexibility. I have explained to them my situation about not adapting well to a new city and a new work culture. They understood my situation and were happy to give me a job back. I am set to start in January 3rd. I really don’t want to give a two weeks notice at my current job of 3 months. Why? Because I really don’t care. I updated it on my resume but I don’t care if I burn a bridge. This company is selfish, doesn’t care about employees nor the people they serve. I have gotten close to a few of my coworkers and have told a few of them about my decision. They have been supportive as they understand me and also want to leave the company but unfortunately they don’t have anywhere else to go. I am an at will employee meaning I have no obligation to leave a two weeks notice. Is it ok for me to just leave ? Or am I an asshole for not caring about two weeks notice?
