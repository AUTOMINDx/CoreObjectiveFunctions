I feel like there is something wrong with me.
I'm terrible with money, I keep getting in trouble, I can't stop lying no matter how much I try, I'm impulsive, I'm untrustworthy, I'm undependable I do things I regret so often, I'm bad at saying what I want, I always feel like I am taking 1 steps forward and 2 step back. I'm 13 in eighth grade.
Edit: how do I tell my parents that I'm feeling this way
