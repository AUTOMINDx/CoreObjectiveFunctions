Real question about roe v wade
I was raised catholic (not my current religion) and heard the religious arguments against abortion but what are the political ones?  The left is bodily autonomy which I support but what is the rights? You can't use a religious reason like life begins at conception in the Supreme Court right? Like I get the Court is crazy right leaning right now but we have separation of church and state right? So religious arguments shouldn't matter. My question is what is the non religious argument against roe v wade?
