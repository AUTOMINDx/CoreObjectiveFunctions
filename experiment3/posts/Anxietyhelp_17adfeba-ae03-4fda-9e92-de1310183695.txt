Health anxiety keeps me from sleeping
I’m 21f. I know I’m young and probably healthy but my anxiety tells me otherwise. I’m seeing a psychologist but she isn’t very helpful. I have a variety of symptoms from headaches to high heart rate, low blood pressure, heart palpitations, etc that I have been to the doctor for but I have to wait 5+ months to see a specialist. Past two weeks I’m up til sunrise because I can’t sleep. It’s like a cycle because the lack of sleep plus sleeping til 5pm gives me anxiety. My biggest fear is dying in my sleep and every night I lay down that’s all I can think about.
