The way my mom treats other children makes me uncomfortable
Growing up, my mom would use a sweeter voice and say things like “honey” to cousins or friends. I would always think it was weird, like why is she using this fake voice that she doesn’t use with me? My mom was not as kind when she talked to me. I guess she would speak to me as if speaking to another adult. But I also don’t know how parents are supposed to talk to their kids. Maybe no one’s parents actually talk in a sweet voice. 

She was also gentler with my younger sister than with me. My sister was the baby while I was responsible and mature (when I was like, 10…). I felt mature at the time but really I think that was just because I couldn’t relate to my peers. In reality I didn’t know how to handle my emotions so I just didn’t feel them. I guess I thought being an adult meant putting your feelings and needs aside to get things done.

This is sort of a random experience I wanted to share. I imagine other people on here were also not treated like kids?
