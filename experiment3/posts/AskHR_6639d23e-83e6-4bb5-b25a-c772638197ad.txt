[AL] Employee blowing up
I'm responsible for HR functions in a very small organization.  I'm not a trained person in this and there's not enough work or people to have a dedicated HR person.

We have an employee who blew up at another employee.  It happened over a petty grievance that wasn't actually related to their job duties. Anyhow, the employee in question screamed, called the other employee names laced with expletives, etc

We obviously want to document this but I want to get it right. I'm thinking if writing that the person "created a hostile work environment for the other employee  by acting unprofessional, disrupting business, and the use of demeaning speech laced with expletives."

Does this sound right? Any drawbacks to doing it this way or reasons not to?
