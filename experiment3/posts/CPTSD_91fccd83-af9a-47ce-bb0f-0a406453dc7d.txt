I hate hearing yelling... it immediately triggers my fight or flight response.
Every time my brother yells it makes me so irritated and I just want to yell back. God I just want to run away from everyone and be alone for a while.

Edit: Thanks for all of the responses, I feel way less alone, it's a horrible thing to deal with, and I wouldn't wish it on the anyone.
