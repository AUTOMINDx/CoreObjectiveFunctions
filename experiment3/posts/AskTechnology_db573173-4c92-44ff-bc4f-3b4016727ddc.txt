My Father-in-law needs help with cell phone
My father in law needs help with improving his cell phone reception. Signal in his area has never been good but it worked for him for the last 8 years. Though lately his cell phone has been spotty at best. We tried to get him to use wifi calling but that did not improve the situation.  He says the issue has worsened after he got his roof replaced with a metal roof. I don't know how that interferes with wifi calling. 

So I figured I'd ask and see if anyone had any cell phone expertise they could share. What could help his situation? A better wifi router? Better cell phone? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
