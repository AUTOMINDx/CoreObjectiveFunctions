If gravity acts on all objects with the same magnitude, can we make a constantly imbalanced wheel? [Not perpetual motion]

This will sound like a perpetual motion machine (I'm not trying to make one) but I am curious of the theory of why such arrangement may not work. I made some scribbles the other day wondering why gravity is constantly attracting everything and everything is falling down at a constant acceleration towards the ground. If there is an imbalance in an object (why a ball rolls) gravity is the correcting factor for its stability. Consider an arrangement of a circular wheel with magnets hoisted on springs at the perimeter, equidistant from the center. All the magnets are polarized the same way. Now, the wheel is completely balanced and there is no net torque on the wheel. The wheel is free to rotate on its axis and it does not have any bias to its resting position. If I am to bring another magnet staring from the axis and towards the magnets in the opposite polarity so that they get repelled, now the resultant center of mass of the wheel is shifted away from the axis of the wheel. This causes an imbalance and a resultant torque (very very small) and the wheel rotates. Once the magnet moves out of the influence of the repelling magnet, another magnet before it will come into the same repulsion. If this cycle continues, the wheel will keep on rotating (ignoring friction, magnets are not getting weakened over time, spherical cow, etc) it seem to be not violating the law of conservation of energy. Please be gentle as this is my first post here. I would like to hear why this is a stupid idea. Thank you!
