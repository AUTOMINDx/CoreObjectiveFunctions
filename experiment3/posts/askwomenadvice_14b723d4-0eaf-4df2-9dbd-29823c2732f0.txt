How do you handle catcalls from men on the street? they make me feel very uneasy and keep getting worse
personally I just try to ignore them and awkwardly keep walking, but it's very annoying and most of them genuinely scare me too. I even had moments that guys would just come walk next or behind me 

over here in the Netherlands any form of self protection is not allowed (not even pepperspray) so im pretty desperate to be honest ðŸ¤ 

any help or tips are really appreciated!!
