How were 4 completely different animals, separated by millions of years, all able to evolve to achieve flight independently of one another?
You have insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Wing shape differ between them all of course, the way the wings are attached to the animals, and perhaps in some cases the motion of the wings in flight. Yet despite all of the differences, each animal's adaptation lead to aviation. Was there any commonality in what influenced the adaptation?
