Ad blocking (and the people who bitch about it)
I'm getting pretty sick and tired about people complaining about ad blocking. I'm mostly addressing youtubers.

I'm not going to buy anything advertised that's not how I discover things to buy, and that's not how most people discover things to buy, so what's the point? You get your five cents (if that) and I have the experience ruined?

Ads are obnoxious and pointless. I get that there's a subset of the population that doesn't mind them, and that's fine, watch all the ads you want. But I have zero sympathy for people who shit talk people who ad block just because they make their crust off of ads.

So is ad blocking in any way wrong, or does the end user have a right to filter content?
