A letter written by a "Freedman" to his former master.
I thought maybe people would find it interesting to read. I thought it was.

[Letter from Jourdon Anderson: A Freedman Writes His Former Master](https://www.facinghistory.org/reconstruction-era/letter-jourdon-anderson-freedman-writes-former-master)

32 years the man had served his master and was not paid a dime. He was shot at by his master, but succeeded to escape, yet he still considers his time 'good' when in possession of his master. (maybe related to others he had a 'good' life?)

It's a heartbreaking story reading between the lines. (Like there are so many of them)

These kind of letters are a good reminder of how evil humans can be!

Edit: I found a couple more letters
