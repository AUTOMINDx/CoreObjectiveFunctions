Why some cultures use same term to address elder brother and male partner?
I was watching Korean TV and realized term "Oppa" is used by women to address elder brother and also for lover or male partner. At least two South Indian languages I know has similar words. Malayalam has word "Etta" used to address elder brother and husband, a closely related language Tamil uses the word "Maama" (meaning uncle) to address uncle and a lover - both I believe are not wide spread but typical in some communities.

It was socially established norm for a girl to marry the young sibling of her Mother (uncle) amongst some Tamil speakers, and similarly among some Malayalam speakers it is okay to marry elder cousins (often addressed as "Etta" during childhood). So I am assuming these word and its usage came from such marital practices.

Is there a similar reason why "Oppa" is used by Korean women in its current form, any other cultures does something similar and for what reasons?
