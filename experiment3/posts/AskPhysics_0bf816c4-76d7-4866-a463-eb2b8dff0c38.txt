Observed by whom or what?
If the double slit electron experiment results are altered by observation, what are the parameters of "observation"? How is the type of observation limited? Does being observed by a sentient human affect the outcome differently than a cat?  Does the distance from which it is observed change it? A recording device? A blind person rather than a seeing person?
