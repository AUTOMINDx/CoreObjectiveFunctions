Are the prospective PIs just being nice when they say they don't have postdoc funding?
I've been looking for a postdoc in material science/semiconductor devices for a few months now (predominantly east coast) and the only responses I have received so far is a variant of "good CV but I have no funding, if you can get funds, we can work something out". This has been 7-8 responses out of 60-70 applications. Is something on my CV driving them away or are they really short on funds? 

\- Some of these are profs who have announced openings on their pages 

\- Some recently received NSF grants

I'm not able to gauge their responses, please help!

Me: PhD from a top university in India + 1 yr of postphd industry experience in a relevant field.
