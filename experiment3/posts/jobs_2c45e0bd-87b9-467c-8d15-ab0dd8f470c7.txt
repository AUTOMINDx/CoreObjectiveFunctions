Enough is enough.
The amount of rejections a person can get must have some sort of breaking point because I'm genuinely frustrated of getting declined constantly over and over again. I don't even know what type of emotion to feel man but people who keep getting declined and STILL moving forward to look for any vacancies are legends because after getting declined by over 1000 jobs I'm at my limit. Even McDonald's won't hire me (nothing wrong with working there) and I'm just feeling sour at the moment. The worst part is I can normally take getting rejected but it is infuriating seeing "we appreciate you taking the time" considering you know you are about to get rejected. I'm sorry for venting but I really wanted to Express my emotions on how difficult it is to look for an job and if I made a bunch of spelling mistakes I apologise.
