Which rising sign am I describing?
Comes off as someone you can always count on, almost never talks about their own emotions but readily listens to other people vent about theirs, keeps cracking jokes in serious situations, very sarcasting and honest attitude, non-judgemental and very accepting, an open personality but only about the events that happen to them not about their emotions, almost seems like their mission is to help others, they keep offering help and their main focus is to serve people in any way possible, no tolerance for drama, they are a bit afraid to try anything non-traditional out of the ordinary (food and other sensory experiences), also the helping part is the kind where in groups they rather do much more than everybody else and keep adding weight to their own shoulders but would never say it's too much (even if it is), very high standards for themselves, very energetic as well, also the type of person who would probably try to comfort you in a physical way if you are emotionally sad, they would try to comfort you by helping you in a hands on way even if that's not the root of your problem, they have an extremely hard time saying no when people ask them for favors, hardcore work ethics but still approachable and friendly
