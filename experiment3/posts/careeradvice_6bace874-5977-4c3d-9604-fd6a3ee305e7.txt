I have to *give* my first job interview in order to hire an "assistant." Any tips?
I've built up my role quite considerably to the point where I need someone to execute some of the more operational / "put the text into this template" kind of stuff, they will be hired to take on some of the more procedural things I do. 

Obviously I have common sense, but I'm interested to know what kind of things would be nice to know in advance, going in as someone hiring someone else.
