19 year old thinks they're 10
19 year old genetic female identifies as a male, smoker, recovering cocaine addict, no alcohol, 

Diagnosed with: depression, anxiety, autism, ADHD, ODD, 

Undiagnosed PTSD, Has all symptoms, nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety for 3 months now

Since a couple days ago he's been having episodes where he thinks he's 10 again. He can't remember anything after autumn time 2012. He's obviously quite distressed and acting like a 10 year old. I've been with him every time, it's been about 6 episodes over the past two days. Lasting between an hour and 4 hours, average 2.5.

They seem to be lasting longer and longer, each time 10 year old can't remember anything from previous episodes, can't remember me, and when it stops, 19 year old can remember some bits but says it's like remembering a dream. 

When in 10 year old state, he seems like a normal 10 year old. It's at the point in his life just before his trauma occured. Once he's calm we can have a nice chat, watch cartoons, play games, etc. Never any danger to himself other than trying to run away/ tries to hit me sometimes.

Does anyone have any advice? The on-call doctor was pretty useless, just said to not think of anything triggering.
