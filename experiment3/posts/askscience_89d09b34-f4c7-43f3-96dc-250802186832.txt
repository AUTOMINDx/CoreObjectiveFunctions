How can you estimate the temperature of an arc discharge in air generated through high-frequency AC?
Hi everyone. I'm wondering if it is possible or if there are methods to estimate the temperature of a plasma generated from an high-frequency arc discharge in air, like arcs generated from an arc lighter.

Would it be dependant on the frequency, the distance between the electrodes or other things? The closest thing I found is related to the concept of electron temperature, but I haven't found any clear way to compute it.

Thanks for your help and have a nice day!

Edit: it would be in order to build an arc furnace capable of reaching temperatures up to 2100Â°C, to melt corundum
