Does anyone ever feel like they have no purpose?
So is been a bad couple years and a even worse past few months. Recently divorced and laid off, both a surprise. Several friends ghosted me.  Nothing really interests me anymore and life is cruelly unfair, you know. 
Just feeling helpless, lonely and lost.
