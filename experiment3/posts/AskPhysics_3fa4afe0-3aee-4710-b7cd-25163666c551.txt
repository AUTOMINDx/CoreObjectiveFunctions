When an object is spinning extremely quickly, why does it appear to spin slowly in the opposite direction?
I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit for the question but since physics deals with light and related waves, I thought why not ask.

This is the inspiration for my question and it can be an example.

I'm sure I'm not the only one here who has wondered.

(Question, in case you didn't see it in the title)
If an object is spinning extremely fast, fast enough for our eyes to not follow it properly, why does it's "blur" look to be going in slow motion in the opposite direction that it's spinning in?
