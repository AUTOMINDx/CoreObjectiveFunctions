Mom was angry for not wanting to scan the paper tag that her child chewed
Sooo here we go. I (23F)was working in a supermarket when a family approached. I started scanning things when I realized the baby in the cart was chewing one of the clothes’ tag. So I asked if I could have it since it was chewed I couldn’t scan it. And I was a bit squirmish about touching something which is drenched in a strangers saliva. Usually the clothes have the barcode on the inside of the cloth on a small tag so I had to type it in. Because it is really small numbers it takes a bit of time.

Mom: Omg what’s taking so long?

Me: Trying to not touch your baby’s saliva?

Mom: Why can’t you just ignore it?

Me: Huh?

Mom: She is just 4m she can’t get you sick

Me: I just don’t want to touch that

Mom: I know she is not sick I am her mom

Me: If it was my baby’s saliva I wouldn’t care. But stranger’s saliva just freaks me out to be honest. 

She was fuming at this point but I just scanned the remaining items and sent her away. After an hour my manager asked to speak with me and turned out she complained and I told her the story and she was just rolling her eyes and told me how much she hates these customers. 

I don’t know redditors you tell me. Would you touch something which is covered in a strangers saliva or I am the only one who just gets disgusted about that?
