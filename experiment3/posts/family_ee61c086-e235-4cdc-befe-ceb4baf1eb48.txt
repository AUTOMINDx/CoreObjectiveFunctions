Dad has a second family and double life
So my mom and us (me and my sisters) found out that my dad has been living a double life for 20 years. He has a girlfriend and 2 other kids that are around 15 years old! He lied about having work trips and that’s why he travelled a lot. When we found out , he acted insane, and started treating us very weird, saying we have no right to be mad, because its a marital issue and has nothing to do with us. I was really heartbroken because my mom was completely in love with him and was devastated when she found out. Right now they just got divorced and he left with the other family. He doesn’t call us for birthdays or any day, just sometimes sends a chunk of cash or something expensive. I don’t know how to act. People say to just forgive him becase “boys will be boys” (i hate this society) and some people say to never talk to him again. I’ve gone to therapy and nothing works for me…he completely destroyed my family and doesn’t take accountability for anything…he just says he’s depressed because this happened to him, and he’s acting like a victim…he is a narcissist losing control. He had everyone’s respect and appreciation and now everyone hates him…doesn’t care at all how we feel…never asked once how we are doing! I don’t know how to act or feel. Right now i don’t want a relationship with him at all. *but i do want his sweet sweet cash 🤷🏽‍♀️ any advice?
