Is there any way to get info about the interior of a black hole or is it physically impossible and unknowable?
Assuming we don't make any discoveries which radically alter our view of physics of course. Is there any way that we can theorize about how to find out what the spacetime structure past the event horizon is like? Or is it as physically impossible as a perpetual motion machine?
