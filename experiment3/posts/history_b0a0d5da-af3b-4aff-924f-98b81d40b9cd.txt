What were European natives like (Their lifestyle, culture, etc.) before they became more civilized and modern? (&amp; another question about Native Americans)
I'm from America and I just realized, how come I've never heard anything about Europeans lifestlye before all the castles and houses and roads and stuff. 

What was their life like before civilization, when they were in predicaments similar to Native Americans or the tribes of Africa?

I tried searching this up but all that comes up is stuff on Native Americans. 

I also have another mini question. Is the United States the country with the fewest amount of natives living there?

Almost everybody in this country is from europe, africa, south america, or asia. 

I have only seen people with clear Native American descent maybe once or twice.

And never actually met a full-blooded Native American who is living within that culture, since most of them are on the west coast and in their tiny designated areas.

But yeah, I just randomly had those 2 questions and figured I'd come on here to ask.
