If you have sex on the first date, is the future of the relationship doomed?
Probably a silly question asked a thousand times, but has ever happened to you that a first date with sex involved turned into a long-term relationship?
I understand that obviously everything depends on the people involved, but I know there's still this conception and I wanted to hear your thoughts.
