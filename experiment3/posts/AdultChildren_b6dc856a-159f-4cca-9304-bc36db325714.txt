relapse
I just needed to vent. I feel so alone and want to talk about it, but at the same time I don't even want to tell anyone about this. The last time my mom relapsed was 5 days ago, and that day didn't go so bad, but today is worse. She's been screaming, hitting doors, calling me a bitch and an asshole, hitting herself, ect. I don't know what to do. I don't think I can even do anything. I can't drive, so I can't leave. I'm also afraid to leave because I'm afraid she'll do something dumb or die. I even had a fleeting thought wishing she would die. I'm in so much pain. I wish she'd just stop.
