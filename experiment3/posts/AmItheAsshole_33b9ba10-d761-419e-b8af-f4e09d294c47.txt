AITA for calling my ex-husband and telling him that his wife force our daughter to babysit?
My(34F) ex-husband (40M) married a woman (36F) with 4 children (1M, 11&amp;11F, 14M) six years ago, we have a mutual daughter (15) who has told me before how she tries to ''impose'' a relationship between her and her step-siblings. 

My daughter is a very introvert, shy girl, she's told me that her time together with the kids is usually watching movies or spending time with her dad and that she doesn't like being left alone with them because she's too easily distracted and they're always running and doesn't listen to her, but that he step-mom is always scolding her because ''that's not the type of relationship she wants them to have''.

Both my ex-husband and I've talked to her and she's always insisting that as ''their older sister'' she should be ''more involved'' with them as in babysitting, diaper change, offering to wake up with the baby and take care of him for an hour of two but my daughter doesn't feel comfortable with that kind of responsibility and I get it. Not everyone is made to take care of babies. 

My daughter was invited to this ''party'' (more like a reunion, 5-10 people all vaxx) during Sunday and was super excited about it, my ex and his wife had a wedding that same day so the plan was that they dropped the kids with her sister around 2pm and my daughter with their friend after that, I thought that was what they did until around 5pm my daughter called me and told me that she left her with all the kids and the baby needed his diaper changed and she didn't know how to do it, she was crying and scared so I drove there and took care of them. 

I called my ex and asked wtf and he told me that my daughter said she didn't wanted to go to the party anymore but my daughter told me that his wife forced her to say it because ''she was done with her laziness'' so she say she didn't deserve to have fun and had to work for it  he obviously got mat and drove back immediately, I left with my daughter when they came. He came back yesterday to apologize to my daughter and apparently he's thinking about divorce because she endangered all 5 kids and she's calling me an AH for ''babying'' my kid.
