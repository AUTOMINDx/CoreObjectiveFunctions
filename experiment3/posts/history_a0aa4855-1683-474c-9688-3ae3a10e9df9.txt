Did Ancient Sculptors Throw Lots of Versions Away?
I was just looking at an image of an ancient Roman sculpture of an Emperor  and wondered how they got such detail right first time - or whether there was ancient land fills full of half finished statues! I Googled it and got some answers around clay modelling first and then using some kind of device that maps it to the marble; but that seemingly was only invented in the 18th C. Others mentioned reworking bits around a mistake, which makes sense in some cases, such as changing the hang of a garment or the like. But you couldn’t do that if, say, you’d got the dimple in someone’s chin too deep, for example, not when it’s a real person  who’s possibly gonna be offended at the massive chin dimple and can also have you crucified….
