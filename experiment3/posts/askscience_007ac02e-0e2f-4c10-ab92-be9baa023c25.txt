Do people respond to acronyms with the same part of their brain as their actual phrases?
ALSO: Provided they understand both the phrase and the acronym, will a person respond to an acronym of a phrase and the actual phrase in the same way?  


I was texting my friend about how it's weird that people find it easier to talk about the treatment of POWs over the treatment of prisoners of war. He responded a bit later that he had "fallen for it" and didn't really have a visceral response when he read "POWs" but did when he read "prisoners of war" in my text, even though afaik he knows what POW stands for.   


I keep trying to find studies on how acronyms affect our thinking in situations like this but I mostly just find the list of abbreviations used in neuroscience with the way I'm searching :P can anyone help me out here? 

The first question is more neuroscience but the second is more psychology so sorry if there's a way to add two flairs and I didn't realize it lol
