What improvements were made to the JWST since 2007?
Obviously NASA hasn't spent the past 14 years just dealing with bureaucracy and waiting for a perfect launch window. They have been improving the JWST this entire time. I'm curious in what ways is the 2021 JWST better than the 2007 version?

I'm more interested in hardware improvements than software improvements, as software changes would have just been pushed to it anyways.
