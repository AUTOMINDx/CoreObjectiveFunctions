Struggling with a higher power
I am struggling with my second step, since I do not logically believe that there is a higher power that knows everything and knows where I’m supposed to go. I understand the need for something else other than yourself to support you, so it’s a healthy delusion that you can make up for yourself but I just can’t accept that there’s a random person watching over me because that freaks me out so much and I don’t know how to proceed.
