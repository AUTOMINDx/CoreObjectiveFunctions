My sister wants my wife and I to come visit more often, but my wife doesn’t like my sister’s personality/values. How do I have that conversation with my sister?
My sister (let’s call her Susan) really wants my wife and I to come visit her more often. But the problem is that my wife isn’t too fond of my sister Susan. Here’s just a few things my wife doesn’t like about her:

* Susan can be homophobic at times (my wife and I are a straight couple, but we feel strongly about LGBTQ acceptance).  
* Susan is emotionally needy - she needs a lot of attention for her to feel satisfied in her relationships.  
* Susan has a cynical, egotistical personality - she thinks everyone is a hater and always out to get her.  

Despite all this, my sister is always nice and cordial with us. She doesn’t treat me and my wife bad or anything, but my wife is just the polar opposite of my sister and she doesn’t like a lot of my sister’s personality traits — which makes her not want to visit as often.

How do I have this conversation with my sister? Obviously, telling her “my wife doesn’t like you” will probably only make things worse. But I’m not sure how to handle this.
