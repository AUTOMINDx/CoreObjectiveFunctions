Any Other Introverts Powering Through the Holidays?
Some of my husbands family is staying at my place for a couple days for Christmas and boy is my social meter wiped 🥵 I feel so rude, I’m kind of avoiding everyone and just letting them all have their fun in the dining room. I haven’t seen my husband look so *at home* in so long so I’m kinda just staying out of the way because I don’t want him to worry about me.

The only time I really have to interact with everyone is during meal times. Which would be fine if everyone would stop looking at me like a colorful fish in a fish tank everytime I sit down because they’re excited to see me try some new Vietnamese food on the table. Then there’s the light teasing for when I fail to do some casual custom (like greeting an older person when they sit at the table) and some more chuckles when I get too shy to say a word they want me to say in Vietnamese. I’ve had to reject several drinks they keep trying to give me because I’m breastfeeding and apparently I’m so out of touch with alcohol culture in general I didn’t know I was kinda breaking drinking etiquette if I (unwillingly) do a “cheers” thing with an empty glass or if I don’t take a sip immediately after. They do this so out of the blue too so I don’t have a water ready to do it.

Anxiety is such a pain in the ass 😩 Everyone is so nice and friendly and I’m like that weird American gremlin who occasionally comes out, grabs a snack, and then shuffles back into my cave.

Pray for me. I’m going to be visiting &amp; meeting the ENTIRE family one day in Vietnam…and I thought MY family was big!
