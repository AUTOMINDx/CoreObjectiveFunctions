I hate when people say "But they're your parents!" when the topic of estrangement comes up
Yes, they are my parents...and I was their child, deserving of care, love, security, and attention. Somehow that part always gets left out. They messed up that obligation big time, and now I'm an adult.

Strength to everyone here; as I keep telling myself, no one is owed a relationship with another person.
