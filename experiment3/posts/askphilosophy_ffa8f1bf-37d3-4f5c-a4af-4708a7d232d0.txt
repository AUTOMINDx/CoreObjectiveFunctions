Introductory books for understanding Kant, Hegel, Marx, Lacan, Zizek, Semiotics, and post-structuralism?
Hi everyone, I have a (very) basic understanding of all of the above, however it is very unstructured and based on bits from here and there. What are your recommendations on books that introduce the above, preferably in an organised sistematic manner? Books that would pave a way for further development by helping to set up a foundation.

Of course recommendations of books, courses, podcasts that link two or more of them are very welcomed.
