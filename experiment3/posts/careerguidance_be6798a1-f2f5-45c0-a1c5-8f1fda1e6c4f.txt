What jobs would allow me to work outdoors at night?
Part time or otherwise. I was thinking about the guy who delivers my parents' paper. He works at midnight for a couple hours 5 days a week and earns and extra 20k or so a year. There aren't any paper delivery positions available, but i think working at night outdoors would be something cool. Any suggestions?
