My ex has a new boyfriend
We broke up for about 4 months now. I checked to see how she's been doing last night, stalked her Instagram account, and guess what I found, she already has a highlight made for her new boyfriend.

It's so devastating to see the love of your life already with another person and whom you wanted to share your life with. I'm crushed. How did you guys deal with this kind of problem? I just want everything to be over  


Edit: I couldn't appreciate every single one of you enough that has responded to me, legit made me feel better :)) thank you Reddit people. To whoever whose also dealing with the same heartbreak as me, you're not alone.
