Why mostly everyone wants to be in leadership/management vs individual contributor/employee?
Hi,

Why mostly everyone wants to get to management/leadership vs individual contributor/employee?

Yes, being in leadership/management, you have more visibility in the internals of the company, decision making, your work is to make others work. 

Is being a individual contributor/employee a dead end?

I heard an opinion that if you are in your 40-50 years old and if you are not in leadership/management you did something wrong. 

Can you also be an individual contributor/employee at age of 40-50? Tech changes to quickly, so it seem logical to climb the ladder to work up to people responsibility roles. 

Talking about IT/tech organizations.

European region. I know is U.S there is a big pay gap between those roles, in Europe, not that much. 

Thanks,
