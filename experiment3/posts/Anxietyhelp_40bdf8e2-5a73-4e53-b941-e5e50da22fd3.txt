Is it gut feeling or Anxiety?
The title kind of explains my struggle at the moment. I haven’t worked in a year and a half (financially I haven’t had to) and decided to apply to a company I’ve always wanted to work for. Was offered the job and I am suppose to start 12/27 and I feel so panicked. I don’t know what to do. I feel stuck between oh it’s just anxiety about something new or maybe it’s a gut feeling that this isn’t the right move to make. Please help!
