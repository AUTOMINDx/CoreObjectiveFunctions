I'm glad someone suggested this group to me.
It's nice reading the post and comments and knowing there are people out there that are similar to me. I grow up sheltered. All I know is chaos, addicts, arguing, mental illness, you name it. I had friends but barely saw them outside of school. I didn't talk about my life and my friends all seemed to have normal-ish families.
