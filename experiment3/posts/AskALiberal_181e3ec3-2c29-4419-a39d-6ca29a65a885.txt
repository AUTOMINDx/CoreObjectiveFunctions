Do you have friends and family that are conservative these days? If so how are your interactions/discussions and overall relationship with them?
My best friend is a liberal and I still keep in touch. We can still have friendly debate and agree to disagree in the end. Today it just seems much more politically divided than it was 10 years ago so Iâ€™m wondering what your experiences are with close friends and family who have different politics?
