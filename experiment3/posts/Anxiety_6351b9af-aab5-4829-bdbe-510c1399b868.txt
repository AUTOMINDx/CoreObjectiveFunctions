anybody have problems with skin picking?
i literally ruin myself by constantly picking at my legs, chest and face. i have scars on my body and red marks all the time. i cant seem to stop. is it a way to cope with anxiety or a self harm thing? i just donâ€™t understand why i cant stop. it makes me so insecure:(
