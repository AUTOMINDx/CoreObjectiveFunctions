I've been unemployed for 5 years after graduating from university but i was accepted for an entry level position on my 2nd interview. Do I deserve this job?
I've been unemployed after graduating in mechanical engineering 5 years ago and I started looking for job last month cause I wanted to experience what full time work feels like. 
 
I got accepted on my 2nd interview for an entry level position in a company I think I don't deserve. My interview went well and I gave all the answers I was asked.

But I'm confused because it makes no sense that why would they prefer me over candidates who have graduated recently from university. Why would they waste money training me for 3 moths when they could just get a fresher graduate with an year of experience who probably knows more about working in a company ? I'm seriously anxious cause I've never worked and I think I don't deserve this kind of opportunity.
