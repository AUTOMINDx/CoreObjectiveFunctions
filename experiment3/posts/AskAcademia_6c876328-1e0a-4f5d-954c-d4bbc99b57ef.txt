Tell me about your file organization system.
I’ve got a new job that will be primarily research, and I’m looking to improve my file organization system, including naming conventions and sub folder structure.  In particular how to tie grants, experiments, and manuscripts together, as well as ideas for keeping the files that could be shared with anyone, anytime, more obviously separate from the personal, e.g. my stream-of-consciousness notes that I take when doing literature review. Don’t assume what you do should obvious!  I need ideas!
