Mapping "Critique of Pure Reason": Some secondary literature suggestions for a humble STEMlord's reading of Kant ?
Dear All,

I come from an Engineering background but I was always passionate in Art/Humanities. Over the past few year due to several episodes of existential crisis and one case burnout I've found myself drawn more and more into philosophy. Now I know what you're going to say, that philosophy won't make my problems go away or give me answers ... and I know all that. I just enjoy reading and learning again, even so that I might change my field so that there's some inter-disciplinary Research or do a PhD or whatever. 

So I've started reading. I did Aristotles' physics and Nicomachean Ethics; which was surprisingly nice. I briefly went through the history of the classics with Copleston's "A History of Philosophy". I went through Descartes' meditations, Summaries on hobbs and Bacon; which were easy. Spinoza's Ethics was .... difficult but I managed somehow and I went through lock and Leibniz's sections in Russel's HoP. Now I've arrived at Kant, specifically the critique of pure reason; which is by far the most difficult text I've ever read.

Let's get to the point, I don't think I can get through Kant by my own and I need help. Some annoying Phil Grad told me the best method is to just go throught the book itself, which might've been helpful for him but not for me, a person that isn't academically trained in philosophy. 

My Question is, what is your recommending for secondary literature to be read alongside CoPR and Kant's further works ? I don't need any simplifications but as mapping the ideas in Kant's writings is very difficult, I would love it if there was some book out there that broke down in detail  everything Kant says in each clause of each chapter of CoPR and how it relates to each other. If that's too much to ask, an in detail analysis would be very helpful. 

Thanx and sorry for the wall of text.
