Do employers generally assume things about job candidates based on their degrees? Or does it just depend on the employer?
For example, I have a B.S. in Computer Science. I kind of feel like most employers assume these things about me:

- I would want to become a Software Developer as a career

- I might not have good social skills. (Which doesn't make sense to me because I have years of customer service on my resume)

- I'm a nerdy kind of person 

I just sense these general assumptions sometimes.
