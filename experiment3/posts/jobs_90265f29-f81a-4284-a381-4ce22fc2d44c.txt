Where the hell are all of these jobs that are “so easy” to get now because of the great resignation?
I have a master’s degree and years of work experience and I still can’t find a thing. I’ve been applying and applying and all I’m getting is rejection after rejection after rejection. Where are these jobs that everyone seems to think are just falling off trees?
