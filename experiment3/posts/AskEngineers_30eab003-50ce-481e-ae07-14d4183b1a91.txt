Which is more attractive to employers: 4.0 GPA without many extracurriculars/internships or mid/low 3 with multiple internships and lots of extracurricular projects etc?
I’m a sophomore BSME with a GPA of 3.6. I apply what I learn in class to personal projects and demonstrate my passion for engineering in general through projects I do for fun. 

I also have been working basically a co-op job since January for a multinational conglomerate.

Should I continue spending time on projects, working and networking with the expectation of getting mostly Bs or focus more on school with the goal of getting mostly As?

My goal after graduation is to enter the workforce, not go to grad school. 

And yes, I realize at this point I wouldn’t be able to raise a 3.66 to a 4.0.
