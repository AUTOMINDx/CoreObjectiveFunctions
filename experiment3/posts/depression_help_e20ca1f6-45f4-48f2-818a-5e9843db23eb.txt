I wish I could wear a sign.
I wish I could just wear a big sign around my neck that says something like I'm very depressed bear with me while I work on it.

And then have people understand and work respect it.

I want to scream about it.

Because I'm tired of feeling like I can't let it show.
Like I Have to be a big strong man.

The truth is I am figuring it out.
I am getting better.
But it's a struggle.  It's hard and it has taken its toll on me physically and mentally over the past 25 years.

I'm done hiding my pain.  I'm tired of feeling sad. I'm ready to be angry for not living my life for wasting my time on this self hatred self loathing.

I'm done being overweight because it hurts to move and because nobody feels pain while eating a fully loaded meatball sub.

I need the freedom to work on myself and let the world know if I'm not doing great today just give me time.
