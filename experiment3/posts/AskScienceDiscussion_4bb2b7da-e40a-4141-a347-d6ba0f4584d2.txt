What are some of the most feasible solutions for all the biomedical waste that has been generated due to COVID-19?
About 33% of the biomedical waste generated in my country (India) in May 2021 is due to the single-use plastic in the form of surgical masks, face shields, gloves, shoe covers, and other personal protective items which are being used on a massive scale in these times. This has been negatively impacting the environment. Dumps of these equipments can be found on roadways, behind hospitals, on beaches, in parking lots, in landfills, etc. What are some scalable solutions that can be implemented (both on a small and large scale) to help fix this issue?
