Little to no prior work experience at age 27
My cousin is 27 years old and hasn't really had a job before. Kind of. He has helped a family photography business here and there when it came to some contract jobs.  He had dropped out of college (computer science). At this point, even if he was to study for something and get a certification, like on HVAC or CompTIA Security+ or Network+, I feel like there would just be a massive resume gap or even worse, a lack of any job history. Maybe he could put a photography position on his resume and just say he was getting out of photography. Though I'm not too sure if that would be enough or look weird still. Currently doesn't seem too interested in anything particular job wise, though I'd still want him to aim for something beyond working a general retail/food industry job just for the sake of a few years of experience in anything.

How does one get out of this and get their first true job at such a late start without the major long term lack of any job history shutting down any job application attempt? How would you make a resume not look like a terrible red flag?
