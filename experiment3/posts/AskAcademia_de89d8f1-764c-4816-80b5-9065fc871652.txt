Anyone else seeing lots of trolls in subdiscipline subreddits?
I don't know if this happens in subdiscipline subs, but both r/genetics and r/evolution have a lot of (I assume outsiders/trolls) baiting people into discussions of either eugenics or "if evolution is true why does X happen". It's so frequent that it makes academic Twitter seem more friendly. Does this happen in other disciplines, for example do social science subs get hit with troll bait around "Cultural Marxism" or CRT?
