I just found the perfect internal job opportunity at my company. The problem is, I’m 18 months pregnant. Should I pursue?
I’d be nervous about making an internal move only to go on maternity leave not long after. (My company gives generous maternity leave.) I wasn’t planning to make career moves until next summer but what are the chances this opportunity will come around again?

Edit: FUCK I meant 18 weeks. I’m not birthing elephants.
