Hunched shoulders + neck tension?
Does anyone else have this very very uncomfortable feeling of having hunched shoulders and the neck being tense? 

That's the main reason i stay in bed because it's such an uncomfortable feeling that occurs whenever i'm not laying down, whether it be sitting or standing up.

Any recommendations, explanations?

Thanks in advance! Xoxo
