[MI] Giving notice in a toxic workplace
I am getting ready to relocate from MI to CA. I am moving for multiple reasons - to be with my partner, to return to my actual job field, and because the job I am currently working is, frankly, terrible. 

I have not told a soul at work that I am in the process of interviewing for other positions or planning to relocate. I am the only female in an office of 20 men, working in IT currently. The office is toxic in every way possible: no COVID precautions, misogynistic, passive aggressive, and just a miserable place to be. I am paid about $5/hr less than the lowest paid man in the office, but I am currently performing 3 different jobs due to other staff having quit or been fired in my time here, and I am treated like crap and verbally abused by management. There is no HR here.

I expect to have a job offer within the next week or so, and as soon as I do, I will be giving notice. How do I address this with my boss, who is sure to blow up at me regardless of what reason I give? Do I even bother addressing the obvious workplace culture issues that are contributing to my leaving, knowing they will neither care nor make the effort to change anything in the future?
