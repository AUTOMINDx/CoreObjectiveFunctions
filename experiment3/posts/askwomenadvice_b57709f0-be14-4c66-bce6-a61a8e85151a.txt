How to bring the news to a girl i'm seeing that I physically cannot have piv sex?
I (28m) am currently flirting mutually with a friend / colleague. We will soon go on a trip together and share a hotel room (which she proposed). I would love for something to grow out of this.

She is pretty liberal sexually and there may be a chance of something happening. I'm the opposite of her as I am still a virgin due to a physical condition. Have a micropenis due to which piv sex is out of the question. Have had a few opportunities but sadly none of the girls wanted to continue after it being revealed and hence i'm still very green.

My question therefore is how and when do I bring the news of my incapability of having piv sex? I don't realy know how to deal with this in the least awkward way. 

There may not be an opportunity at all during this trip but I want to prepare myself for if there is one. Hoping to get some good advice :). Thank you all so much already.
