At what point does national debt become critical?
At the moment, we have a national debt of about 28T USD, of which 21T is held internally, agency to agency.  Coincidently, the US GDP is about 21T USD. Service on foreign-held debt is about 500B USD annually (7% interest). So that means that foreign debt service is about 2.3% of our income.

Conventional advice given to homeowners regarding debt is that the mortgage service should not be more than 25% of your income.    That advice would imply that the US income could carry a much bigger debt load than it has now.

If internally paid interest is budget neutral, at what point does foreign-held debt become a threat?
