Pregnant and mom keeps trying
My mom keeps trying to call and text since finding out that I’m pregnant.  I don’t even want to talk to her honestly.  She still drinks and doesn’t respect boundaries.  But thinks we’re starting fresh without apologies or any ownership for what she’s said and done.  All because she has Grandchild on the way.  
I’m not looking for an apology for the shit I’ve been through my whole life but even just this year alone.  It’s frustrating to hear the voicemails of a concerned mother who is a nasty person to me when she’s drunk.. which is often.  I have to break the cycle and protect my future family.  It’s really sad that I have to even prepare myself to not have her around or be a part of my child’s life.
