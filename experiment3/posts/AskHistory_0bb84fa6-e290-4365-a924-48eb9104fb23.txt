In an episode of Star Trek, Captain Picard says, "To instantly transform a society with technology would be harmful and destructive." Are there any examples of this in history?
To be clear, I'm not looking for an example of a huge leap in technology like the atom bomb or social media, but an example where a more technologically evolved society grants a more primitive society access to their technology. How did that turn out?
