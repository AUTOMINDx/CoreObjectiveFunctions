Is there a time frame for "full protection" after the third (booster) shot for the covid-19 vaccines?
I've been wondering since here in Germany, literally the day you get your booster, you count as having had 3 shots but I remember that for the second one you had to wait 2 weeks until you were "fully immunized". Legalities are one thing, but from a virology point of view, is there such a time frame for the booster shot? I assume that it's shorter because each time your immune system has a shorter response time than before?
