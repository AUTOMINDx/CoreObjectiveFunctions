Your memory WILL come back.
I know one of the most devastating symptoms of DPDR can be memory failure. As someone who has had DPDR for nearly 6 years, I have struggled with memory issues daily. It can be incredibly frustrating and scary to have your memory slip from you, so I understand the feeling of hopelessness that can come from it. Recently, I've been doing a little bit better in life and my brain has started to open up a little bit more. And with it, my memory is coming straight back. I'm able to remember relatively insignificant things from days ago, and it's not hard to keep things in my mind anymore.

If you are struggling with memory issues hardcore, don't worry. You haven't lost it forever. It might take you awhile to get it back (in my case, years) but it will come back to you like you never lost it. Don't worry, your memory loss is **not** permanent. Your brain hasn't forgotten how to remember, it's just not doing it very efficiently at the moment. Everyone's DPDR path is different, so try to be kind to yourself if it takes your symptoms a long time to go away.
