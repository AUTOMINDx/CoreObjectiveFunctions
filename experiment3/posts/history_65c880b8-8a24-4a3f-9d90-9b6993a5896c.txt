Cost of taking a train to move out west vs a wagon
I started watching the show '1883', and the first episode has a group of german immigrants taking a wagon train from texas to oregon because they could not afford the locomotive. Was it really cheaper to travel 2000 miles via wagon instead of a train in 1883? The show mentioned it was $200 per family to take the wagons, but in reality did poor immigrants still migrate via wagon despite all of the risks instead of the train? How much was a train ticket during this time that would make a family even consider going via wagon?
