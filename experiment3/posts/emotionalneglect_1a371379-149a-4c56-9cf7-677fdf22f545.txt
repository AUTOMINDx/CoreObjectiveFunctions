My parents were nice to me but I dont remember being told they loved me, being hugged or kissed to comfort me. I also don't remember expressing my parents my emotions at all, it's like Im unable to open up with them. Is this emotionsl neglect? Also, emotional neglect always implies CPTSD?
Thank you so much ❤️

And sorry, I have just realised so many things in the past few days and I have so many doubts
