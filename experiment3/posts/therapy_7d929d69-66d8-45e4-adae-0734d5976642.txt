Therapists! Do you really care for the person you’re trying to help?
I don’t mean to come of rude or anything. I’m genuinely scared because I am so deep in fear and anxiety atm and from everything I have done therapy seems like the last place. And I’m so scared to go because if it doesn’t work then idk how I’ll react. Then I’m scared to give up and be defeated. 

Because I’m assuming if someone is really wants to help you that will greatly increase chances of success
