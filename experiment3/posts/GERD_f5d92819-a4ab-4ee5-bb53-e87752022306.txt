My positive experience
Hello everyone, I thought I’d share my positive experience hoping it may help 
I (33M) have been diagnosed with GERD back in 2015, and I thought my life was over. I had all the symptoms (regurgitation, lump in throat, nausea, etc..) even with a strict diet.
After seeing a specialist he prescribed Esomeprazole for life. First 6 months were the hardest, and then it gradually started getting better. I eventually would go a full month with no symptoms 
During a regular checkup my Dr suggested I get an upper GI Endoscopy to make sure there are no complications. 
I was very hesitant and honestly anxious before my Endoscopy. I just got back home from the Endoscopy, and it went great and thankfully there was no damage to my stomach nor my esophagus 
If there’s any advice I can give, it’s please try and reduce stress, I know it helped me the most.
Good luck to everyone and merry Christmas :)
