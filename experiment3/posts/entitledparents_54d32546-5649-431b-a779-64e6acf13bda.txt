Mom cries over me needing therapy
I recently asked my parents to get me some therapy as a way to cope with years of depression, bullying and body image problems. 

My parents (who are very traditional and conservative) said I look too happy to be depressed. Late at night my mom had a talk with me about what I was feeling (keep in mind most of my problems are because of them mentally abusing me for years) 

So I told her that I was feeling lonely and alone for a long time since I don’t have any friends. I left out all parts about her being the problem. 

After talking for some time she started crying and saying she wasn’t a good mother. A talk which started with us discussing my mental health ended with me having to comfort and reassure her that she wasn’t a bad parent.

Edit- I also wanted to add that I was a very unwanted child and she didn’t want to abort me due to social pressure. She believes since I took away the good years of her life I should make it up to her. (I was born 4 days before their first marriage anniversary)

Edit 2- for all the people asking why I haven’t run away or I should I am a minor. They provide for me and my education and this is a critical school year. I do not have to choice to run and I am planning on getting away at some point
