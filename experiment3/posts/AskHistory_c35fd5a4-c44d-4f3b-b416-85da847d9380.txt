What did everyday life look like for the average citizen in small villages and towns during the English Civil Wars?
Particularly around the mid-1640s - I'm carrying out a creative project set during the times of Matthew Hopkins, the Witchhunter General and want to know how the war would effect the day to day lives of the average citizens, particularly in small towns and villages of Southern England where Hopkins carried out his actions.
