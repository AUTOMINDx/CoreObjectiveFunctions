Weird “FIZZING” sound from stomach and throat!?
So basically the last few months I’ve been having an extremely weird sensation. I find it very hard to describe in words, but it’s
Driving me insane. It’s as If the feeling of “hunger” or “stomach rumbles” which used to just stay in my stomach, is passing through my stomach and into my throat. It like air or something escaping up through my oesophagus and making an almost high pitched sizzling or fizz sound in my throat. I can’t be the only one with this!?


I am currently on X2 Nexium 40g a day.
