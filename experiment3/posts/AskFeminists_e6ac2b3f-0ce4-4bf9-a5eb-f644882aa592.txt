Is criticising making traditionally Male characters Female valid or misogynistic?
I was thinking about this recently and was curious due to the backlash on movies like Ghostbusters or the Black Widow Movie where Taskmaster a beloved comic book villain who is a Male was revealed to be a Woman. 

So is complaining about gender twists valid or is it like complaining that James Bond shouldn’t be black which I don’t agree with. 

Thanks in advance
