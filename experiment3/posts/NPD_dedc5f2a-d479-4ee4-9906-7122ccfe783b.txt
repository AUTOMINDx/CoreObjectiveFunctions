Do people with NPD suffer from a lack of "emotional empathy" rather than "cognitive empathy" or do they lack both?
My understanding of the two kinds of empathy is that emotional empathy is being able to feel what another person is feeling. Whereas cognitive empathy is being able to understand the emotions of another?  


Does it make sense that people with Cluster B personality disorders in general suffer from a lack of emotional empathy but they definitely can understand how to deal with people's emotions on a day to day basis without actually feeling for them at all?
