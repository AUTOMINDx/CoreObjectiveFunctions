i be head over heels and once i sense that they fell in love, they start appearing ugly and they lose ALL value in my eyes, i am so fucking broken to the core because it keeps happening
i really try to change myself, i want to be a human, it not even love bombing that i do at first because i mean everything i do but once they start loving me, i lose all interest and they seem disgusting, how do we fix that shit.
