I(26F) caught my husband(30M) taking a naked picture of me without my permission. What should I do?
Married 4 years, no kids. He literally has hundreds of nudes from me over the years that he took with permission. If I am looking extra good to him, he will ask to take a picture and I will either say yes or no. I thought that was that.

So today, we were sleeping cuddling. I sleep naked always so this wasn't new. It got hot under the covers so I came out and laid on top. My throat has been dry lately so I have a cup of water on the floor by the bed. I bent over the edge of the bed to pick up the cup and drink in that position so I had my ass hanging up for a bit I guess. Well I turn around and my HUSBAND has a freaking phone out and is taking a picture of me. WTF! I ask him if he was just taking a picture of me and he goes quiet. I keep repeating the question and he starts saying no , takes his phone, turns it to where I cant see and literally starts deleting the picture in front of me while saying no he didn't. He deletes the picture and tries to hand it to me to see that he did not take the picture.

Like he must think I am stupid or something. I kicked him out of  the bedroom and here I am livid. I don't know if am overreacting since he is technically my husband not some random dude.
