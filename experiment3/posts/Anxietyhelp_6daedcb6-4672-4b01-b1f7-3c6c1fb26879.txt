Anxiety
37 black female 5’9 260lbs

It started 11/5 working from home. My eyes was blurry at the computer and i felt dizzy. Next say same symptoms but i was extremely fatigued. I went to ER and diagnosed me with vertigo. Later that evening i began to have migraine. Every day after that until last week. Ive had muscle spasms, shortness of breath, chest tightness, heart palpitations loss of appetite and insomnia Now my digestive system is messing with me . I’ve been to the ER, urgent care and my pcp more than 6 times each. I’ve gotten a Ct and MRI of my head, xray and ct of my chest, blood work all call back normal. Ive had an ekg multiple times a d worn a heart monitor for a week. I’ve woken up out my sleep grabbing my chest and not able to go back. My doctor prescribed me zoloft 25mg and ambien. I want to believe it’s anxiety but i keep google and thinking maybe the doctors are missing something. Oh ! Ive seen a cardiologist, neurologist, pulmonologist . I started the gym and trying to eat . I think im having side effects from the zoloft now.
