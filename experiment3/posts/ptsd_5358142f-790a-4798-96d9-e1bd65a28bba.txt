Anyone else try to get rid of material things that remind them of their trauma?
Lately I have this urge to get rid of anything that I had used or wore during that difficult traumatic period. I canâ€™t bear to look at that coat, backpack, shoes or scrubs that I wore during those sad shifts at the hospital. Those items are perfectly fine and in working condition. I avoid touching or even looking at them and would rather donate or toss them. When I talk to loved ones about this, they are supportive but donâ€™t understand why I have such a strong desire to toss these objects. Anyone else feel a strong desire to get rid of stuff that remind them of their trauma?

Edit.
