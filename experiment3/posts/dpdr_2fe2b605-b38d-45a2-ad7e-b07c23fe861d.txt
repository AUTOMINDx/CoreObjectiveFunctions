Looking for people like me / Dysphoria about having a body
i am not sure if this post is right for this sub. but ive said that verbatim a couple times now and im starting to think nowhere is right, or rather i might never be able to find the right place. ive been told what i am experiencing could be dpdr, but i dont think it is, mainly because i dont think how i feel *has a name.*

to be blunt: i have what i can only describe as 'dysphoria about having a body', or 'dysphoria about being made of meat'. 

that is the most literal and simple definition of how i feel. "like a transgender person feels about their gender, but applied to their whole body". i think about it every day, on a regular basis, desperately wanting to be outside of my body or anything except what i am. i am hit by extraordinary lows where i cannot stop being disgusted by myself. i cannot eat or sleep, let alone things i wont mention, without feeling degraded at best and distraught at worst. i am humiliated by bodily functions period, i feel great shame that i must regularly do disgusting things to live. i cant touch my skin when im sleeping. *it's literally like my body is a flesh prison*, like those fucking memes except completely unironically. im swimming in this sort of self loathing, hating myself for this thing im inside, hating that i might be it. i dont want to be flesh, i dont want to be an ape, i dont want to be an animal. i do not like thinking that i am a disgusting, consuming thing. i feel unfixably, inherently rotten. i have considered very drastic measures as a result. i do not want to be this way for the rest of my life. i do not want to be disgusting

ive been very hesitant to say that or the phrase 'dysphoria' because i didnt want to appropriate a term used by people actively struggling with something medically recognized. i guess im only confidently using it now because my therapist said it was appropriate. i have seen two. neither had an actual diagnosis or word for how i felt. i have had OCD, dysphoria (generally) and DPDR floated around, among others. but there isn't a word for this i think. dpdr seems wide ranging and the experiences i see here fit a million different molds, but i dont even disassociate as much as hate what i am intensely

the only relief i can get, other than someone telling me they can put my brain in a robot or a computer or something, is finding people who feel the same way as me. it makes me feel less alone in it, especially when the [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/jxma3i/i_dont_want_to_be_an_animal_anymore/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/voidpunk/comments/o45b15/i_feel_trapped_in_my_body/) i posted about this had mixed results in that regard. i do not have a community or a support group that i feel i belong in. there isn't a *name* for how i feel - or at least one i could find, and im *desperate* to find one - and that only exacerbates the isolation and helplessness i feel.

i have tried to remedy this every way i can. i google keywords and phrase combinations that mostly align with how i feel. *i hate being an animal, i hate being made of meat, i hate being in a body*, whatever. i discovered both transhumanism and voidpunk this way. the former has solutions that may never come (and i got *very* mixed reactions to how i talked about myself there), the latter is so broad i feel i do not fit in with the vast majority. i have found posts from people passively noticing their 'bodies are disgusting' but completely moved on. *i cannot move on.* and i have searched for and been given a thousand different names for this: biologic dysphoria, transbiologic dysphoria, somatophobia, species dysphoria, full body dysphoria, posthuman dysphoria. i have met people who feel the same way as me, more or less, but i can count the number on one hand. the closest i have ever felt to my voice being repeated was [a clip from a show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOcktbXSfxU) im 70% sure was making fun of people like me.

please get in touch if you feel the same way to any degree. please point me toward a community that shares how i feel, or a discord group chat, or a word. there's a post on my OP saying *if you feel this way please DM!* in case anyone stumbles on it. i have been desperately searching and come up near nix. if anyone can point me in the right direction or share if they feel the same way, please let me know.

**TL;DR**, and i repeat: i have what i can only describe as 'dysphoria about having a body', or 'dysphoria about being made of meat'. *Please* message me if you feel similarly.
