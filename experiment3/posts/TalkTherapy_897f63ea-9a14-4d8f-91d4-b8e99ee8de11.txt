I love it when my therapist says my name
It doesn't happen very often (maybe 5 times in two years), but when they do, it's amazing.  In today's session I had a surprising number of insights about big stuff I've been working on and when they said my name I could feel it in my bones how significant it was to them too.
Just wanted to share.
