Were all ships during WWII a safety nightmare?
I recently came across the story of t[he USS William D. Porter: The Unluckiest Ship in WWII](https://www.usna63.org/tradition/sea_stories/Destroyer.html). It seems like every weapon system was one checklist item away from a deadly mistake (i.e. torpedo primers being the only safety mechanism during a drill). How was the situation on these ships?
