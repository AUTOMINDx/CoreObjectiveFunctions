It’s weird that other people are real and have their own lives
I kinda see people as 2D, like an rpg. It’s hard to think that people are constantly doing things outside of seeing them. I was talking with some peers in class and I had a few seconds where I felt numb, I felt usual depressed self watching my shell interact with people positively and I didn’t let my few bad seconds show externally.
