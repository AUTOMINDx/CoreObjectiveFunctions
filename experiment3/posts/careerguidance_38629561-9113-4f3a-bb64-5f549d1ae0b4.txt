Burnt out hotel worker - Where do I go from here?
Long story short, I’m a GM of a limited service hotel in an airport market and I’ve had my ass handed to me these past 18 months. Covid chewed up the hospitality industry and spit it back out. Name a problem, I’ve had it. Almost 100% turnover at my hotel (only 3 employees have been here for longer than a year), constant staffing issues, supply issues. One day last week, I had to cover 4 different positions because 3 staff members called out. 

I’m burnt out times 10. I’ve talked to my bosses and it doesn’t seem like the work/life balance gets any better the higher I climb, and the only comfort they can give me is that every GM is having the same problems as I am. My stress and anxiety are through the roof, I’ve gained 25 lbs in a year, diagnosed with depression, and I get no satisfaction from my job anymore. 

I’m sure hospitality has some crossover skills, so if I want to get out of hospitality and start over in a new job, where can I go?

Edit: thank you to everyone who has commented advice! I really do appreciate it. I’m currently covering housekeeping after covering breakfast this morning, so I will be looking forward to reading this all when I get off :)
