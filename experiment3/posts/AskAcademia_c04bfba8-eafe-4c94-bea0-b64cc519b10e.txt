Need advice telling a student "no"
(Solved) This is my first semester teaching. My students have a lengthy paper due Tomorrow at 11:59 p.m. I held an office hour on T,R,F last week. I received an email from a student asking me to read his final paper, give him feedback, and tell him what grade he'd receive. 

It's Sunday, I'm not reading anything. But writing feedback at some point on Monday will probably be too late for him to make changes. How do I tell him "No, you had your chance last week." without getting dinged on course evaluations?

Edit: Thank you all for the helpful responses and reassurance! As I mentioned, this is my first semester and have literally never had to tell a student "I'm not helping you right now" before.
