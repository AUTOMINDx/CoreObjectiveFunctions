I caught my girlfriend fucking her manager.
Things have been so good, no flags, no fights, just sweet nights and beautiful days spent together. 

Last night after she got off work she seemed a bit strange with her replies, and then randomly texted me saying she was going out. Due to her working at a baseball stadium, she frequently will grab a drink or two with coworkers after a long day. So I brushed it off. No big deal. 

But as the night went on, I got this feeling. 
Initially I was worried she had gotten a bit too drunk, due to her having an issue once or twice with drinking too much. Around 3:30am, it was radio silence. Nothing for hours. So I decided to drive the ten minutes to the stadium. 

I parked my car, and headed to the parking garage she parks at hoping she wasn’t passed out somewhere. She was not. 
Her car was completely fogged over, and as I got closer I noticed the car shaking from them being on each other. Words can’t describe how absolutely shattered and broken I feel. I woke up early to get her coffee in bed before she went to work yesterday. Today was Christmas shopping for her. And now I lie in my bed completely and utterly in pieces. Why would she do this to me

I am so numb

I am so deeply sad

This was my person

Why?

edit:
I did break up with her after I found them, and then went home afterwards. 
I have since completely blocked her on every channel I can think of, and have removed all of her things from my home.
