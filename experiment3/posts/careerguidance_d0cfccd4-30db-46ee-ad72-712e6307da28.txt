To those who currently have a job/career in coding who do not have a computer science degree or a similar degree in that regard, how did you manage to get your foot in the door in your respective field?
I'm curious to hear how some of you who either do not currently have a degree such as computer science (or did not have one when you first entered your field) managed to get your foot in the door. Did you complete a coding bootcamp online, get certain certifications? Excuse my ignorance if I'm encompassing various jobs under the broad term of *'coding'.*

I intend on working toward a job/career in either coding, software development, web development and those general areas but I currently have no degree that could possibly make my job search easier in that regard. I don't plan on attending college for a degree either considering college is expensive and I don't want to saddle myself with a ton of debt.

I recently started the first course on ***freecodecamp.org*** a few weeks ago and I plan on completing those courses to hopefully help my job prospects down the road. I have little to no background related to coding etc currently, but I recently completed the ***data analytics*** certification/program offered by Google on coursera and that course consisted of the fundamentals of things like data manipulation/aggregation, data visualization, SQL, programming with R, working with spreadsheets and databases, queries etc. I understand data analytics is a somewhat different field than coding, but it did help me understand and improve upon things like general syntax of programming, data analysis etc; there are certainly several if not many parallels between data analytics and coding IMO.

**TL;DR:** apologies for the long winded post, but once more curious to hear how those of you who had no background prior to your current coding job managed to get in your respective field and what advice, suggestions etc you might have for a newcomer seeking to transition into that general field. Thank you.
