My GF is super mad because I asked another girl...
My GF and I went to the mall yesterday to go christams shopping. Everything was perfect until we decided to stop at a smoke shop Kiosk and bought some incense for the house. After I bought the incense and asked the female employee if they accept tips to leave a dollor for her. My girlfriend blew uuuuppp!!!! She was soo mad like if I cheated on her and felt extremely disrespected. She hasnt talked to me at all since yesterday.. 

Mind you, I also purchased a T-Shirt from a small local brand as well and tipped the cashier $1 because I support small bussinesses and their emplyees since I worked in small start up service businesses my self for many years. 

What should I do.. I hate feeling bad about small things like this
