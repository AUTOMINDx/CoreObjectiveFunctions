My (29M) Boyfriend Stopped Going Down On Me (24F): How Do I Bring It Up?
I 24F have been with my 29M boyfriend for 3 years. Very healthy relationship and very good sex life. Up until the last few months, that is. We typically have sex I would say once per week. Nothing crazy. But when we started dating, it was naturally more frequent and way more exciting. I know that’s normal. He has always been good at giving head, and I would like to think based off of results I am also good. We don’t always have time during the week to even hang out, let alone have sex, so if we do manage to have sex it is very to the point. If we have sex on the weekends, we spend way more time fooling around first and really teasing each other. Usually I start with a blow job, and he will either pull me over his face to 69, or flip me onto my back and eat me out in missionary. Very detailed, I’m sorry. My dilemma is that the last 3-4 times I’ve given him a beej, he has not ate me out. Sometimes it disappoints me so bad I lose my groove and don’t finish at all. I know I need to ask him why he stopped, and I know it’s most likely something I need to fix, but I’m so afraid of us both getting our feelings hurt somehow. How do I ask him in a way that’s not too forward?

Update: I ask him straight up why he doesn’t want to go down on me anymore. I reassured him that I am not upset with him, it’s just been weighing on my mind and I would never know if I did not ask. He said that he didn’t realize that he hadn’t returned the favor in so long. It’s not that he doesn’t want to, and he said there’s absolutely nothing wrong with my lady bits. Thank you all for the words of advice and encouragement! I’ve only been on Reddit for about a week and I feel so seen here.
