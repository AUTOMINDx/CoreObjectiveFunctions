I just saw a post full of anti-vax people and, I hate to say the word, but I’m actually triggered and upset and disappointed.
It had roughly 90+ comments and every single first comment I saw was, “I’m young and healthy. I have no reason to get it,” and when people called them selfish they’d defend themselves saying the government this and the government that. That people should be responsible for their own health and not blame other people...

I have no words for that... I’m just so upset and disheartened and disgusted. Who talks like that and doesn’t realize how self centered they’re being...
