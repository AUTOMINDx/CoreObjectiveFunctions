I miss cuddling...
I miss sitting on the couch with someone, watching a movie together. I miss the closeness of being wrapped in a blanket together. I miss the comfort and soundness of another person's arms. I miss the euphoria of holding another hand in mine. I miss the pure bliss of resting my head on someone's chest and closing my eyes. I miss the love of looking into someone's eyes, and leaning in for a tender kiss...

I just miss it all so much.
