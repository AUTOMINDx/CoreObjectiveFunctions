Anyone else just feel totally inadequate reading this and all the ask subs here?
I spend so much time reading these subs and a lot of the time the answers just make me realise how far behind at 36 I am. I check here and all the ask men and women subs and it's like seeing flaws in my life. 

Gonna try to stop looking.
