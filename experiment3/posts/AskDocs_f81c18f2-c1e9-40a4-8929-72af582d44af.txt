Is this a sign of sex abuse toddler?
I am babysitting a 2 year old girl. Changed diaper and under the vaginal opening, on the perineum, there is a depression, a “sunken in” area. Like there was a hole at one time and skin grew over it. Its not deep but noticeable and enough to get feces stuck in. There was nothing else notable, no redness bruising etc. I have tried google and can’t find anything about this particular finding. I have babysat this child months ago and this wasn’t there that I noticed nor when she was a baby.
