Is there a school of thought discussing the anxiety of being seen?
Relative newbie to anything philosophy. 

I’ve been wondering about the fear of being seen by others ever since I learned a bit about the fear of envy. I think a facet of it would encompass the fear of envy and measures people take to avoid it, but I wonder if there’s some broader discussions of forms of malicious gaze that also address being seen as something that may not be based on envy. 

I’m curious how a “fear of being seen” impacts self perception and perception of others individually and broadly. 

Are there philosophers who examine this?
