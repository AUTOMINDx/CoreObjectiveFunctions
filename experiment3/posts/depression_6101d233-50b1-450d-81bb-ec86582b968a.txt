My therapist let me in on THE REAL REASON why they care if you end your life
Its because they get in trouble and can lose their license over it. Thanks for guilting me, therapist. Shes been frantically calling and making me have to double check with phone calls and 2 appointments a week because my dogs dying possibly and I cant even be depressed over it because how i have to worry about her locking me up over fear of HER life being affected &lt;3333 wow so supportive! I feel so safe with my therapist its like they REALLY care /s lmao what a joke. I think I'm gonna quit therapy over it, if you are so worried about your job then shit, dont let me inconvenience you with the possibility of ending my life, I gotta be considerate y'know.

EDIT: thank you for the awards and anyone doing that Redditcaresources, please don't. It was a nice gesture but I've seen it weaponized by rude people and have it disabled. But thank you
