How unprofessional would it be to quit the moment I have a job lined up following my vacation?
I hate my coworkers, i face sexual innuendos and grossness at work, if they give me the opportunity to get a signed offer letter, i have enough savings to just screw off in the interim period (a month or even three months or more max) but after 3 months iâ€™d get bored 

Is it unprofessional to burn that bridge? I hate the company deeply
