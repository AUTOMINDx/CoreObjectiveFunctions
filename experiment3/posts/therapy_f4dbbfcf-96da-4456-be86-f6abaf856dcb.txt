Gotta talk about my experience of “group therapy”. This shit is the WORST. [TW: Suicide]
So yeah, when I was 14, my psychiatrist told me to try group therapy. I agreed (now feeling like that dude from interstellar that was screaming “NO! NO! NO!”) 


My first day was pretty ok, but next days were the worst. 


Once we were talking about suicide. Most people started to cry. Most people, who get triggered by someone crying started to also cry or try to help those who are already crying. What a mess.


Besides that, I was wearing a necklace with a fake blade. Psychiatrist asked me “If you wanted to kill yourself, why didn’t you try with a blade?” I was REALLY shocked and had no words to say, I was staring at him creepily. What the fuck.


I remember that there was a dude who had problems with speaking and talking. A psychiatrist asked him a question that offended him (I don’t remember what was it, but it was an offensive question) and that dude was like “Are you fucking with me?”. At first we were all shocked, but then I realized that he was right.


And the last moment that literally broke me down was a fucking aqua park. That groupie therapy decided to go to an aqua park and NO ONE TOLD ME AT ALL, NOR THAT PSYCHIATRIST WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO TELL ME ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE WAS IN CHARGE OF IT. I came to the center, and I see that no one is there. I was like wtf. A psychologist came up to me and asked me “Hey, how can I help you?” I told her about the group and she was like “Oh, they are at aqua park!” I was so shocked. I told her that no one told me about it. 


That was my last day as far as I remember. I am 16 right now, and looking back, I realized that the place was a mess. Thank god at least I have a better psychologist now who actually helps me.
