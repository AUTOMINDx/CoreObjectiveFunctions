Can sperm really live for 5 days in the uterus at ANY time during a woman's cycle?
I have read a lot of posts from women (both trying to conceive and afraid of conception) asking whether or not it's possible to get pregnant at various times of their cycles.

E.g., "I had sex on Day 4 while still bleeding. Can I get pregnant?"

The answer I always see is that "yes you can because sperm can survive for upwards of 5 days in the female reproductive system."

However, I had thought that 5 days was only under optimal conditions (namely fertile window leading into ovulation). Is it true that sperm can easily survive for 5 days during menstruation?

Is there a good study on this? I haven't had luck finding it.
