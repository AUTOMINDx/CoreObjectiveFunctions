Does it look bad to leave a position after 6mo because I got licensed in my field and want a more senior position?
I work in Trade Compliance and got my US Customs Broker License this year after I started at a company in June. It’s the equivalent of an Accountant getting their CPA in my field. 

I see that I’m meeting the requirements for more senior positions on job posts and this should be about a 30% raise. Plus I keep hearing “now is the best time to get more money” from all posts.

Does it look bad to say something like “I’m just ready for a more senior role and my job doesn’t have the opportunities?”
