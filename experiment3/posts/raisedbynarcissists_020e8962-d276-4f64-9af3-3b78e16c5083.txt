Yes, If you abuse your kid then they most likely will fail school.
No...kids cant just pull themselves up by their bootstraps...they are just kids.

A while ago I read a thread about a dude who is unemployed and can't find work because he failed high school when he was younger due to the abuse he was receiving from his family.


The people in the comments genuinely didn't give a fuck. They said that he must have been lazy and/or stupid to fail high school and the abuse didnt matter.


Are these people insane? Beating your kid is gonna have consequences on him. Especially academically since studying requires you to be in a decent mental state....which you cant be in if you're getting the shit beaten out of you.

These comments make me so sad. People have no fucking idea.
