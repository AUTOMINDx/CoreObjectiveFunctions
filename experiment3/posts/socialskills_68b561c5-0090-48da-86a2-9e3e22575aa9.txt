15 and friends think I’m ugly and will die a virgin.
I dress well, I have great hygiene. I wear nice cologne, but my friend group all call my ugly, not necessarily directly, but indirectly, and they think I will die a virgin.
We recently did a smash or pass thing, and everyone had at least 2 people say smash, but out of everyone, mine was the only one where literally everyone in the group said pass.

I don’t know how to go like this. I feel embarrassed and sad. And they never give me honesty about things, they just do random shit and I find out what they think of me.

First, I think I am good looking, not just saying that.
I’m 5”6.
Even the 2 (and I don’t say this to be mean) fat guys in our group have hooked up with people, and they got half smash half pass.
I know I might seem like I’m overreacting, but please don’t give me that, I just want real advice on what to do, I’ve never gotten with a girl and the way everyone thinks of me, I don’t think I ever will.
