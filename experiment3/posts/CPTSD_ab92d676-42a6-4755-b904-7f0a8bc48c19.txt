DAE have a fantasy word they spend more of their time in, as a coping mechanism for their reality?
I have this imaginary world that I’ve visualized for myself for 10-15 years from now, complete with an imaginary wife and children. They have names, and even distinct faces.

I spend time talking to them, playing with my kids. It’s pathetic, I know. Call me an incel or whatever. But I’ve only recently realized how much time I actually spend in this world, to the point where it has almost become my reality.

Does anyone else do this?
