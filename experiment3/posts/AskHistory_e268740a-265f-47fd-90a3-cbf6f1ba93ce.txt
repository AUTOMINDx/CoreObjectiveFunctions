Who had a better chance of winning, the Central Powers in WWI or the Axis in WWII?
I know that the odds were stacked against both. But if you had to place bets on either, which do you think had a better chance for victory?

Disclaimer: for purposes of this question, victory does not have to mean total world domination, it could mean a negotiated peace in their favor.
