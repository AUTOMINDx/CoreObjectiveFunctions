I Want To Change
Right now, I'm not really all that happy with my life. Therefore, I'm looking forward to change my life in the next year, but I don't know where to begin with and what I should (or shouldn't) do. Should I get a new haircut? Get a new job? Move to a new place? I'm honestly pretty lost and I'm looking for some direction. Could anyone give me an advice, please?
