Where do common cold and flu infections come from?
My question is about the human virome and wether you get get sick with a cold or flu without any human to human interaction (aka in isolation).

I know that, for example, staph bacteria is normally found on the skin of healthy individuals and then occasionally become pathogenic if they get into skin pores, or skin cuts or the personâ€™s immunity drops.

Does the same thing happen with viruses that cause the common cold or flu? 

Are rhinoviruses for example normally found in healthy humans like staph bacteria is found on healthy skin?
Do these viruses then become pathogenic due to drops in immune function? Or do all cases of common cold and flu infections come from viruses that a healthy human is exposed to from outside their body?

Thank you so much
