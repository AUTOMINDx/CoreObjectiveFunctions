[CA] Terminated employee is claiming I broke confidentiality?
I work as an HR rep for a retail store. 2 days ago an employee was fired. Today he send me a text pretty much saying I need to stay out of his business and I broke confidentiality. I showed my manager and she said that shes going to call him because I could get in trouble if he reports me to corporate.

I'm really confused how I can be in trouble for this? I didn't process his termination, and the reason was never told to me. Tbh I dont even care about this person enough to even ask to talk about him. On top of that, not a single person even asked about him.

Sorry if this is a dumb question im new to HR but could I seriously get in trouble for this?
