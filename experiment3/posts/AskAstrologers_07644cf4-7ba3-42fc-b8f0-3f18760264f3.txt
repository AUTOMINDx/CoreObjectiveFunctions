2022 should be a better year than this year at least it seems to look like it
I’ve been looking at some of the major stuff and there’s really not much that Saturn-Uranus Square won’t be the big theme of next year (THANK GOD LOL) I remember reading about it in 2020 and was like well that sounds scary and it definitely was and has been an ongoing thing we can thank the gods we don’t have that next year 


Overall 2022 is definitely looking a lot different than this year no Jupiter and Saturn together in the same sign the nodes shifting into a position more akin to 2012-2013 also Mercury Retrograde takes some pressure off of Air signs because In each of them it’ll Retrograde back into the previous signs you got the Jupiter-Neptune conjunction in April and some other stuff but Jupiter will be stronger this year especially when it goes into Aries And putting Mars there it looks like a year of more forward momentum and less emphasis on restriction unlike the past couple years been definitely looking forward to this stuff
