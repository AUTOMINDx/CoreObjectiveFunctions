How should I come out to my (possibly transphobic) wife?
I’m the past few months, and with the help of my therapist, I have determined that I am most likely trans MtF. My wife and I grew up in churches, which are extremely hateful and unaccepting of the LGBTQ community. Which is why my feelings and thoughts have been repressed for so long and why I have such massive depression and why I hate my body. I don’t know how to come out to her or my family because I am afraid I will lose everything. I’m wondering how I can break this down as tactfully and politely as possible while also being firm in my position. I’m just looking for advice or insight from the others in this wonderful community. Thank you in advance for your help and encouragement. I have never felt more accepted by anyone than I have in the last couple of months talking to people in this community.

Edit: idk if people will actually see this edit, but is there any one here in the Memphis area that is comfortable PMing me? I’m trying to build IRL support as well as online. Just testing the waters here
