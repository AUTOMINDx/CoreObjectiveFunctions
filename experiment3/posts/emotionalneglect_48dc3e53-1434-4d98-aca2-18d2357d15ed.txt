Whats under the anger - everyone keeps saying this
I am starting to work through anger, and its really difficult.  Heads an utter mess with the vengeance vs. wanting my FOO to see what they did as wrong vs. wanting to break away vs. my loneliness and the hurt and abandonment of me time and time again.....

Everyone tells me that underneath the anger is sadness, and i get that, and i can see that but it also scares me.  

I want them to suffer at times, i want my family to recognise what they did.  

Its all utter nonsense, as this wont happen.  its the hope of that inner child.

So then, how do i get him to face and feel that pain, and through the anger?  

i am doing bits, and its working i think, but just looking for ideas, and sharing
