My therapist told me I'm too undecided for therapy
So. I went to therapy for the first time, twice, i thought he could help me. He suspected a combined depressive borderline disorder and adhd (mostly because i told him that). In the 2nd session I told him I was unsure about whether I could get along with him and that I don't quite know what my goals of therapy are. 

I have some emotional dysregulation problems, mood swings that I struggle with a lot, and in general a lot of self identity struggles (also social). Can anyone help me figure out what my next steps are? How I can learn to work on this on my own?
