My sister is throwing shade
Okay so about a year ago, I (16F)ended up getting pregnant and having an abortion. I didn’t tell my dad so I couldn’t have it at home. My sister(27F) was there to support me at all my appointments and I even stayed there when I took the pills. Well today, she sent a very political post to our sisters group chat (there’s 3 of us) and it said “sorry I don’t accept “follow the science” from people who say babies aren’t alive until they are born”.
She knows that this topic is very sensitive to me. Do I confront her about it?
