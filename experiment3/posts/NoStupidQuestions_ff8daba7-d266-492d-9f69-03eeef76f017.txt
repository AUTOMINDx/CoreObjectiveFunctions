Is it true that if you get in an accident and a paramedic sees on your license you are an organ donor, they won't try as hard to save you?
Or is this a myth?

Edit: thank you everyone for your responses! A little more information on why I asked--I heard this many times growing up, especially in high school (c. early 2000's). I haven't thought of it since, and I just randomly remembered it yesterday before posting here. So, it's not like I believed it all these years, I just didn't give it anymore thought. I know it is an absolutely absurd notion, but as an American I know the U.S. can be a strange place and some whack ass shit goes down here sometimes. So honestly, I would not have been all that surprised if it were true to some extent.
