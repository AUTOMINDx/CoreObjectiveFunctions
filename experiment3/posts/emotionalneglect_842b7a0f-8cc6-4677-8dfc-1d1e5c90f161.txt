After going no contact with his deeply dysfunctional and neglectful family, my husband is struggling. How can I help him?
I’ll try and keep this as tight as I can. My husband of five years (partner of 13 years) has, after trying again to heal a major rift in his family, finally gone no contact. I’ll admit I’m relieved. Seeing the man you love slowly and regularly emotionally tormented by his parents and siblings is so painful. 

But for him, the relief is not instant. He’s suddenly grappling with the demons of emotional and literal neglect, verbal abuse, an alcoholic father, a prescription pill addicted mother and now addicted sisters, physical abuse, suicides, being abandoned for 3 years when he came out at 18, extreme childhood poverty (no running water, days without meals, no medical or dental care until adulthood). It’s honestly a miracle he wasn’t sexually abused. These people took one of the kindest souls to ever be put on earth, threw him in the mud, and left him there to rot. They want him as rotten as they are. 

I hold him every night while he cries. He cries because he feels like an orphan. He cries because no one who knew him as a boy speaks to him. He cries because he feels like he was never loved. He cries because he can’t be “good enough.”  I’m trying so hard to help but I don’t know how. All I know to do is love him even harder, listen, and make life at home as pleasant as humanly possible. He’s SO STRONG and I know he’ll make it through this.  

He’s in therapy but that’s very recent. It's a long road. 

I want to do some practical things to help.  I’ve looked up some commonly reviewed books here that perhaps I can buy? I’d like to buy him a nice journal as well so perhaps he can pour out some of his feelings to paper and soften the hurt. I’d also like to buy him some proper stationery to write to his late grandparents whom he loved very much. They were the only familial love he ever felt. 

Are these good ideas? I’m wholly open to suggestions. Please, anything I can do. I’m desperate to help him heal.



*EDIT*: **WOW thank you all so much for your comments. I'm sorry there is so much pain in this world but I'm glad so many folks are on a path to healing. Based on comments and DMs, these are the books I plan to buy my husband.**

* The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma

* Running on Empty: Overcome Your Childhood Emotional Neglect

* Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents

Also, to the folks who told me to look out for myself, thank you! I assure you I am well. I think fate/the universe/ dumb luck was looking out for us by making us a couple. I am blessed with intense emotional resiliency and grit, so while I am not superhuman I am able to be strong for him now and be a rock to hold onto in this storm. But storms pass and so will this and then there will be space for me to recharge and renew. :)
