Introductory texts to computational philosophy and or the philosophy of computers/automated reasoning?
Sorry if this isn’t the kind of question allowed here. I’ve been getting into philosophy as a whole and have heard of texts regarding the aforementioned topics and I was wondering if there were any good reads or resources for learning more about them. Thx
