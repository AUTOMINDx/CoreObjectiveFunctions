Why did Romanis leave India and why did they mostly immigrate to Europe?
Were they expelled or did they voluntarily leave? Also, the whole of the distance between India and Europe is Asia yet there are little to no Romani people who have immigrated to Asian countries. Why did they all flock to Europe instead of nearby communities in Asia? thanks in advance.
