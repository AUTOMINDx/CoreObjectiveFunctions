People who love your jobs.. what do you do?
I'm currently working as a real estate agent. I'm doing well, but it's a lot of stress and long hours (commission is tied to whether people take your advice or not, working weekends, having to cancel family plans last second to show a house/write an offer, etc). I'm thinking about a career change and looking for ideas.
