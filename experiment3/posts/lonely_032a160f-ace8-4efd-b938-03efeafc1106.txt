21M BOO! I'm male ignore this post
Well hi! lmao I hope I got your attention from my title . It's kinda true isn't it every girl gets lots of attention here it's kinda funny . 
Anyway half way through this year wasn't so bad everything was going alright but then things turned on me i had a amazing Online friend for more then a year in the end she just started ignoring me and stopped texting me basically then abandoned me . 
Now it's been few months I took some time alone to myself to figure out if i wanna have a online friend again because it's kinda sad getting abandoned again and again without knowing what I did even when I cared for someone . 
Well today i decided to break out of my shell and try to just put myself here and see if i can get a good friend again and not be lonely at the end of the year.

If you're someone who have been abandoned and betrayed i know how you feel . I'm the kind of person who wants a friend for a long long time and make memories with them , Talk to them everyday , tell them about my life , recommend a movie or a show , ask them how they're doing , make them feel better about themselves , watch movies and stuff together, I wish we could game but I don't have a pc lol , 
Anyway hit me up i got lots to talk about . Also I don't care if you're gay , straight , blue , black or a pineapple i just want a friend lol so come we'll have some talk
