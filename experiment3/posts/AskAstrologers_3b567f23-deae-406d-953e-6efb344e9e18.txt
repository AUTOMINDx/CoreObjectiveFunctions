Ascendants make all the difference?
Hi! My friend just sent me a chart of an individual with same planet/sign placements as my chart, and some similar aspects (appears the individual was born in the same month and year as me)... I am astonished at how our charts can look so similar, yet we've lived pretty different lives. I have had questions about twins and astrological charts, what are your thoughts on the role of the ascendant in a chart?
