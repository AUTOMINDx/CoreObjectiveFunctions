Where's my lonely Christmas crew
I got one present this year from a nice old lady - a jar of honey.
It gets easier every Christmas, to have no family and few friends, so not complaining. Just offering an arm out to my fellow lonely Christmas crew. It'll be over with tomorrow and back to normal soon after. So that's something to look forward to :)
