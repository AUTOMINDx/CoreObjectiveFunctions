Was Nancy Reagan really renown for performing oral sex in her days as a film actress?
I understand that this question is rather uncouth, but in light of current events I have become curious as to the validity of rumors of Nancy Reagan's past sexual exploits that have been recently floating around Twitter and beyond. To my knowledge most of these rumors have their roots in Kitty Kelly's 1991 book *Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography*, but how much verifiable truth is there to the claims made in this book?
