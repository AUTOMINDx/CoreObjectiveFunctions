Everyone thinks I’m stupid and It’s making my self esteem go to shit
I’m going to college for fine arts and everyone treats me as if I was stupid. I’m very open to the fact that I have ADHD and I’m very much an extrovert. The thing is, I switched universities and person after person treats me as less then and stupid. In fact, I told a girl in my group assignment that she was treating me as if I was incapable or unintelligent, she responded with telling me that she actually thought I was dumb….
I was bullied as a child and now all this trauma is resurfacing and I’m feeling really depressed like I don’t belong. I don’t understand why I’m having such a hard time making friends and starting my life in this new city…. This is my second year here. What can I do?? I need to feel like someone is willing to be my friend without judging me…..  I don’t know where to start…
