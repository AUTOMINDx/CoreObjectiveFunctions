Being nice vs Flirting
I can never tell when someone is trying to flirt with me. I just always assume a girl is being nice and making casual conversation.
How can I tell the difference?
Like what are some ways people hint at it?

For background, I’m a college student with 0 romantic experience and I’ve only recently started putting myself out there.
