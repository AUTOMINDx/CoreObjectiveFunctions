[The Matrix] How can Agents miss so many shots? Even considering that the resistance has super human abilities, why can't they just turn an 'aim bot' on? The same can be asked about why does their guns run out of ammo?
And I don't think that the "let's not show humans we have super powers" is valid, because they jump between buildings and dodge bullets not having a care in the world.
