Met my all time favorite musician and I can't stop feeling anxiety over it
Last night was amazing. I saw my favorite musician of all time perform and that would've been enough for me. It was an amazing live show and I had been looking forward to it for a long timee. After the show, the musician was in the audience watching the other acts who were performing and I got an opportunity to talk to them. They were super nice to me and we bonded over being from the same place and then we were guessing each other's ages. I was teasing them about being 10 years older than me and I'm worried I took it too far because then they said to me that they had to go. I understand that they were busy, but I'm so worried that I offended them and now I'm really worried I ruined it. Is there anyway to get over this anxiety? It's ruining me and I can't stop overthinking it. I wish I never said anything at all now because I don't wanna offend my favorite musician ever.
