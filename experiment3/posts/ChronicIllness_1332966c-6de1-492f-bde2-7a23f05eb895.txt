Why does sharing make people think you’re faking it?
Irl and online it seems like people think that CI is just a way to get attention. I post about my illnesses because this life can be really isolating and having a community online makes me feel less alone. Is it too much to have an ig where I post medical updates? Like I don’t even post once a month, just when something happens. I didn’t want it on my normal ig, because it’s a lot. And I blog too, but that’s again for sharing updates with people in my life who aren’t on Instagram. These updates are few and far between and usually just get shared on Facebook where relatives and family friends can see, because it’s easier than calling and texting everyone who wants to know what going on. I also do it because it makes me feel better about having a feeding tube at school. Just raising awareness. But “friends” I’ve known for years just don’t believe it. People don’t get chronic illness. They don’t understand why it doesn’t get better and then it just equates to faking in their minds. I know it shouldn’t bother me because it doesn’t really matter, but it just hurts sometimes. Sorry for the rant, i needed to get this off my chest and I know a lot of y’all feel the same way. Stay strong warriors! It’s real and we’re badass fighters.
