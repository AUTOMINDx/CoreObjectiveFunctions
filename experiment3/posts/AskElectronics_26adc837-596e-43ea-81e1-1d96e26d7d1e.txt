10k volt transformer that my step father stole from me decades ago
So my father gifted me a "10k volt transformer" supposedly from a neon (or some other noble gas) sign, I used to use it to create a 3-4 inch arc for various mad science experiments.

My mom got remarried and my step father tossed it and never admitted it, but it was clearly him.

I have since spoke to my dad about this and asked how I could go about replacing it, it was quite heavy and my dad said it was vintage, so I was wondering how I would find something functionally equivalent on ebay or wherever would be cheapest.

any ideas?

edit: I should mention it had an input voltage of 110 vac mains house current / us&amp;a.
