Ts how do you handle all the bad stories you hear without burning out?
Y'all have some many clients with horrible pasts. What's your trick to not let it effect your views? Is it just compartmentalizing?

I know y'all usually have your own T but still that T then hears your issues and has to deal with it.

How do you stay caring but distant enough not to go out and give up?
