Endoscopy fears
So I just wanted to share my experience regarding the procedure. I was referred to a GE to have an endoscopy months ago, and I really never thought much of it until the time drew near.

The endoscopy itself didn't scare me much, but the sedation was what horrified me. I'm overweight and experience sleep paralysis, sleep apnea, asthma, and terrible allergies - so breathing to me is a chore 24/7. The thought of being put under made me think I might stop breathing, and it became almost a phobia of being put to sleep. I did not conquer this fear unfortunately, and I opted to do my endoscopy while awake.

This actually shocked the doctors and my family for some reason. I still think that being sedated is far more terrifying than having an endoscopy done. Anyways, the endoscopy itself went great (considering that its generally not a fun procedure). They brought me back into a pretty open room where they would draw a curtain to give you personal space, they have you lie on the bed and take your blood pressure and ask you general medical questions and what prescriptions you take. This is where they would also prepare the IV but I opted out, so they just gave me supplemental oxygen through the nose and wheeled my bed back into the imaging room - all while being friendly and assuring that I was comfortable. Then they took a small nozzle and sprayed the back of my throat (they ask you to hold it for a moment before swallowing) to numb it and weaken the gag reflex and asked me to lie on my left shoulder. They then strap a small plastic opening in your mouth to make sure you don't bite the camera, and cover your eyes gently with a loose blanket so the light doesn't blind you. Then they take the camera and swiftly move it down your throat. Yes, it is a little uncomfortable and there's a slight choking sensation occasionally but it's very short lived and you have time to relax before they continue generally speaking. During the biopsy I only heard a slight sound but experienced no additional discomfort. Removing the camera was quick and easy. The first thing I said after I was finished was "That was fun", but I'm a sarcastic asshole. But really, nothing to worry about people! Whichever route you go, your doctors will generally try their best to make you comfortable. I get my results in two weeks, but I'm very happy its done with.

I wish you all the best
