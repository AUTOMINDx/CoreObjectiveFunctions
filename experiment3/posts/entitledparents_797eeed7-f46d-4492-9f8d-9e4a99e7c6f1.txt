Entitled Aunt Demanded Money From My Mom
Hey Everyone! You probably read my past entitled aunt story. Now here’s another one!

This happened in 2017. After the death of my sister. My mom sued the city since the city put the pedestrian crosswalk in a blind spot where cars and large trucks couldn’t see them. To make the long story short she won and the city gave a huge amount of money. My entitled aunt heard it and went to seek my mom. 

First My entitled aunt contacted my mom through Facebook. My mom didn’t answer. Then she asked one of my aunts for my mom’s address since she is living with her boyfriend. My entitled aunt went there and knocked on the door.

Her boyfriend answered the door and asked her who is she. My entitled aunt barged in and saw my mom. She was doing the normal hello and how are you crap. Then she went to the point of her visit. She demanded my mom over 20k dollars so she can create her own church. My mom said no since she doesn’t forgiven her for her insensitivity in 2014.

My mom said that she doesn’t deserve any help from her and she is not welcome at her home. My entitled aunt lost it. She yelled at my mom. She called her a sinner and she is going to hell and all the usual religious crap. My mom told her to fuck off and told her she can’t judge her since she was a terrible and bitter woman. My entitled aunt screamed at her once more and openly disowned my mom, brother and all of the family. 

My mom’s boyfriend recorded it and sent the voice message to everyone in the family.  Everyone was hurt but at the same time relieved since they only tolerated her for my grandma but since she passed away they were only keeping contact out of my grandma wishes but now they don’t have to. Since then we have no contact from her or her children.
