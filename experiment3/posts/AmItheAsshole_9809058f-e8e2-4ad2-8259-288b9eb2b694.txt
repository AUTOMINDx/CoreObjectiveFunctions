AITA for not letting my husband fly to another country to help during a family “emergency”?
My FIL is old and unwell, so now whenever there is an issue my in-laws look towards my husband (oldest son) to solve them. It’s not just his immediate family either, his entire extended family also expect the same thing. It would be fine if we lived in the same country but we don’t so my husband often has to fly away just to solve an issue someone else could’ve fixed or to play family judge, jury and executioner.

The latest issues are the consequences of a series of bad decisions made by my BIL finally catching up to him. He got someone that isn’t his wife pregnant and she’s threatening to blow his life up and he got involved in a bad crowd and is now struggling to get out. My MIL called my husband to ask him to come and fix things. He told me and was planning to leave immediately but I asked him not to go. I don’t want to be left alone right now and my BIL is a big boy who knew what he was doing and can do just as much as my husband can to fix things. I started crying when I asked him not to go and he ended up staying.

A few days later, my BIL called me to beg me to let my husband come because he desperately needed his help and that it was time-sensitive emergency. I told him no and he said I was being selfish and that as family we should help each other during a crisis. Now, he’s angry at me. My MIL also asked me to reconsider because the situation was causing stress for my FIL and having my husband there would help ease his worry.  

Although he hasn’t said anything, my husband also clearly wants to go. He’s on the phone constantly with his family and is trying to solve things from here but is very clearly frustrated that he can’t do more/that he isn’t there.

AITA?
