I'm curious to compare degrees levels to salary
I'm wanting to acquire my degree in mechanical engineering, I've always had a good interest in it. But which is better to strive for a bachelor's degree or a master's degree? What are differences presented in the education for both? Thanks in advance for any advice and knowledge shared. I'm from North Carolina.
