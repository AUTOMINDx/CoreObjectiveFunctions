Is it weird that I feel more comfortable wearing a mask rather than showing my actual face?
Ever since the pandemic started, I feel more comfortable wearing a face mask than showing my actual face. I feel like I'm too grotesque and ugly to look at and wearing a face mask kind of hides that. It's gotten to the point where I think me wearing a face mask is my "actual face". Kind of like how Rorschach thinks his mask is his "actual face". I'm sorry if the post itself is kind of cringey. I'm in desperate need of an answer.
