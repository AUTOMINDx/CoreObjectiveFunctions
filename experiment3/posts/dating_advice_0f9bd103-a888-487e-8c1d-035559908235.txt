He wants anal but I dont
I've been speaking to a guy for a few weeks and he mentioned he is into anal, which I am not. I said that to him and he said its fine but considering how much he mentioned anal to me prior (not him asking me to do it but bringing it up) and even his friends have joked about how much he is obsessed with it, I dunno whether he will be fully happy with me considering we are both looking for long term and he may want it again at some point. I asked him straight up "will you be fine without it?" and he said yeah and I believe he believes his words but considering I've dealt with this in the past and even witnessed a friend in this situation where the guy has said they aint into something and everythings fine for a few months or even years but then they get asked or hinted again and again. Anyone been in this position of either side and can give me advice?
