Can anxiety cause horrible memory?
I can read a paragraph 5 times and then 1 second after I forget everything I just read and don’t know what the topic was about but then there is times I read the most random useless facts and remember it for years does this happen to anyone else with anxiety? No where will test me for add/adhd even tho I had it when I was younger they just say anxiety but I don’t know anyone with this symtom?
