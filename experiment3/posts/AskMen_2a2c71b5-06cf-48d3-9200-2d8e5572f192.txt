Where do you feel 🍆 size insecurities stem from?
My boyfriend (27m) and I (27f) have been dating for about a year and a half. He’s super insecure about his eggplant since he’s a grower and not a show-er. He’s amazing (it’s perfect) but for whatever reason he’s super insecure and doesn’t feel adequate. 

What is the big deal behind size? I obviously hype him up and make him feel great but I’ve noticed this is a trend with almost every guy. Do the insecurities ever stop? Also, is there anything that your partner can do to help?

Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up and I’m reading through all the comments. For those saying women, do you feel it’s most women or just the loudest? I’m trying not to gaslight experiences and want to just hear from everyone else.
