How to be competitive this late in the game
I’m in the second to last year of my PhD (year six). My department (Ivy League, comparative literature) offered no resources, guidance, advice on landing a job or even postdoc. They discouraged publishing too early or presenting at conferences because they claimed it diverted attention/energy from the most important thing: writing a stellar dissertation. Now I’m year 6, no publications, some conference presentations, and terrified I’ve wasted six years of my life. Advice for moving forward/being as competitive as possible on market for TT jobs or postdocs?
