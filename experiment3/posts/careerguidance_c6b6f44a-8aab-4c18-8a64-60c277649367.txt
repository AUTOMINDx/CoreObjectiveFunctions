30, no direction, no core skills, worked various jobs, lost – advise please?
Have a useless bachelor degree in marketing.

Worked a marketing and proposal writing role after UNI and was pretty much just shoving through word documents for years and making a few powerpoints. Learned nothing. In fact, got dumber.

After getting sick of this, went into saas sales. Been in this for a year and my performance is average. Heart isn’t in it. The money and commission doesn’t motivate me either. Stress is pretty high.

Aside from this I don’t have any skills. I can’t think of any. My speaking and writing ability has gotten abysmal since finishing UNI. Honestly find it hard to string or put words together to get what I’m thinking across – NOT good for marketing or sales. I'm also absolutely terrible with numbers, math, analytics. Put a graph in front of me and I run. 

Passions and interests? Can’t think of any. The only thing I have passion for is travelling. Looked into nomad like jobs but I suck at copywriting now, and IT and programming never been my thing. I've worked as a guide before in pubs and clubs, but they dont provide any money. I did however enjoy this - but thats because I was partying all the time.

I'm now in Australia. Am thinking of packing up and moving back to europe. But then don't want to make things more difficult when the wages are a lot lower there. If I can't find something here, why would I find something there?

The only thing I can think of is trying something until you like it. Try another job, try something new. But how long does one seriously do this? I'll be 40 and still trying something? Everything just seems the same. I wouldn’t mind going back to UNI I suppose, but only if I was certain on a degree. Not something useless again and taking on more debt.

Where does one go from here?

Thanks
