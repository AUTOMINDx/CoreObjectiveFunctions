[IL] Not a good story teller, how do I survive behavioral interviews?
Recently been looking for work.  Feels like every job I apply for uses a behavioral interview process.  Iâ€™m a rather introverted person and exceptionally bad at story telling, which I feel these type of interviews test for quite dramatically (perhaps even more than ability to do the job?)

Just looking for some tips, thanks
