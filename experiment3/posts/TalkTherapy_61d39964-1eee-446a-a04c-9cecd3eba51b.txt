How many years of psychotherapy is normal for people with C-PTSD?
I'm sure this will vary wildly depending on the client's experiences... 

I'm seeing someone and have noticed a big change/improvement in my way of thinking about things, my confident, but I also feel I have so much I need to work through... it's been now about 6 months since I've started. Just wondered if it takes years.
