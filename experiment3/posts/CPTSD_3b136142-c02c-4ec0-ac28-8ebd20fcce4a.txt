Did anyone else think they that they might have Autism?
I would say something, my mom would get mad at me and say that I was being rude or snappish and I genuinely didn’t understand why. It wasn’t my intention to sound snappish. I just talk in a very monotone voice sometimes and tend to not smile that often. This happened many times, feeling like I was always offending someone because apparently it was rude. This led to me thinking I might have autistic traits. I don’t think I am autistic though.

Edit: (Title correction) Did anyone else think that they might be autistic?
