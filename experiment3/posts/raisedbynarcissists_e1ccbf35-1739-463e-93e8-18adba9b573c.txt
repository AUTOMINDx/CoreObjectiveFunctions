NMom exclaims how disgusting it is that a guy wants to marry me.
One of my friends (26M) told me that if he wanted to settle down with someone, he’d want it to be me. That he would like to marry someone like me. It was such a nice thing for someone to say about me. So of course I was very happy about it. We’ve been very good friends for a while, he’s probably one of the most genuine guys I’ve ever met. So it meant a lot to me, since he seemed very genuine about it. 

I was talking to my younger sister about this story, I was so happy about it. My mom over heard us talking and jumped in. “Ewwww that’s so fucking gross.” I’m confused and ask what is. “It’s disgusting someone wants to spend their life with you.” I’m completely baffled by her words, speechless. Why the fuck would she say something like that? My mom laughs and repeats eww eww before leaving. 

Kinda ruined the moment for me, but whatever I guess.
