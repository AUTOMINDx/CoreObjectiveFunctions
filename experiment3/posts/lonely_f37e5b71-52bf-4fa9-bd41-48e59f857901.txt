just a word of warning, be careful who messages you after a post here :/
had a man nearly double my age in my dms, took him a whole 12 hours to start asking sexual questions. iâ€™m not a minor(21) but the thought of anyone doing that to someone who is disgusts me

taking advantage of those who are lonely and vulnerable is deplorable, stand up to them, you deserve *SO MUCH* better
