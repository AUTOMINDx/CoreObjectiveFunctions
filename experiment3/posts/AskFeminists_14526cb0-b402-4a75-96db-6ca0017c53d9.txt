The "white knight" stereotype and how it is a defense mechanism for misogynists
So, I am a male feminist who posts responses to relationship advice on Reddit. I've called out disrespect from both men and women, and have defended against bias and misogyny. The issue is, that when I call out misogyny, sometimes I'm hit with the "white knight" stereotype, or am called "self-righteous." I don't know why this seems to be a common defense mechanism for misogynists, but it seems to condemn being the bare minimum of a decent human being.

What I'm doing, calling out disrespect, isn't anything special. But, that doesn't mean that I don't call it when I see it. What these misogynists don't understand is that if it was a woman being equally disrespectful to a man, my response would be the same. However, they don't see it because they take my criticism of some other man as an attack on all men.

With that being said, I don't like generalizations. These misogynists generalize men and women on a consistent basis. Some women make generalizations about men as well. Neither case is acceptable. But defending women makes me a "white knight" in the misogynists' eyes.

I always advocate for equality. I don't expect any recognition for it. What I do hope to find is other people who believe the same things that I do. That's how a movement is started, and how discrimination can be seen as unacceptable. We aren't there yet. But, I believe we can get there if we come together. That's why I point out disrespect. To put those ideas out there.

So, has anyone else encountered the "white knight" stereotype, or any other common defense mechanism from discriminatory people?
