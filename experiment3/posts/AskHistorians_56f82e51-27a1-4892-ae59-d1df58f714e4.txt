Was cunnilingus a common practice in the mid-1700s?
I’m sure you’re reading that question and thinking “why would you ask that?” I have been watching the Hulu original show The Great. It is wildly historically inaccurate in almost every way (but still hilarious), so I feel like I already know the answer, but I figured I would ask anyways. In this show, cunnilingus (eating pussy, going down on a girl, whatever you want to call it) is a sexual act that is brought up surprisingly often, and even talked about and treated like a treat for both men and women. My question is: how common was it for a man to perform this act on a woman? Was it viewed as outrageous? Normal? Did people just pretend that women had no pleasure in sex? And if it did happen, how was it treated? Was it a source of pride, like in the show? Or was it treated as something sinful or shameful, like in the Sopranos (a completely unrelated show, but the only other one I can think of where they talk about this). Thank you in advance for your answer!
