Why do girls keep asking if I'm gay?
So I'm a straight man...

I'm  6'2, I have a deep voice, and my personality I would define as stoic.  The most effeminate thing I've ever done in my entire life was get  scouted to be a model (and I don't tell anyone that).

But  most of us are smart enough to know that anyone can be gay and so  therefore being gay doesn't have a particular 'look' to it. There are  manly gay men, and there are overly camp and flamboyant gay men. There  are all kinds of gay men.

But  typically, when society asks if someone is gay, they are alluding to the  very specific flamboyant stereotype. In other words: Nobody ever asks  if Hugh Jackman is gay because of his portrayal as Wolverine in X-Men.  But they might wonder if he is gay after seeing him on Broadway (that's  just how stereotypes seem to work).

So  it's not that women might assume that I'm gay that bothers me. It's the  stereotype of what people are really poking at when they assume you're  gay â€” femininity, flamboyance, being camp, having a girly voice. And  that's not to say that these qualities are bad, but they all tend to be  deterrents for most women looking for a relationship with a straight  man. And so they're undesirable traits for a straight man to want to  have. More to the point: It's straight-up counterintuitive for het men  to have het women assume we're uninterested in them. So you can see why  this might be problematic in the dating world.

So  I'm genuinely curious to know where this obsession comes from in women  in wanting to know a guy's sexuality. It's not something's that's  happened to me a lot, but it has happened enough for me to find it  peculiar.

Typically, a girl will  appear interested in me romantically. And at some point, ask me if I'm  gay, or spread rumors that I'm gay (if rejected). As someone who is pretty manly I am genuinely curious as to how they even have this wander their minds.

Is it a shit test that some women do?...
