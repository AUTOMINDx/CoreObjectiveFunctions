Can Banks Literally Create Money and Profit Off of it?
So, I recently learned that banks don't need to have the money on hand to lend it. This seemed reasonable to me given that they had reasonable confidence in future payments being able to cover the cost of the new loans, but then I learned that banks will literally create money in this process. Specifically I'm talking about Australia and USA here.

So, when a banks lends let's say 300k out and receives 360k back, does this mean that the bank profited not 60k (the difference) but rather 360k because the 300k never existed in the first place?

As an additional side note, what are the consequences of this 'new money' if this is true. This seems like it would be a driver of inflation to me.

Thanks for the responses.
