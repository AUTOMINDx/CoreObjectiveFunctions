How can I eat a banana without having guys stare at me all the time?
Hey guys I'm an 18 year old woman  doing a programm for my job. It's rather long so I have to eat a few  snacks in between and one of my favorites is bananas because they are  simply delicious. Anyway I've noticed that whenever I pull out my banana  a lot of guys start to look at me while I eat it. I know the obvious  choice would be to break it off but I can't really do that because we  have to stay in the room during the break and we don't have a sink where  I can wash my hands afterwards.

Is there any way I can make them stop looking at me or maybe eat the banana a bit different?
