Attachment
Attachment is the most bizarre thing. I am extremely independent. I like to not need anyone and never want anything sentimental or gooey. 

But my therapist sent me a text clarifying an appointment time and I keep looking at it and getting a warm fuzzy feeling. I I mean… seriously… it’s literally “would you be able to make it half an hour earlier on Tuesday?” but somehow it feels good? (I don’t know what feelings are, is this supposed to be love or something because I also defffffinitely don’t want to love my therapist. That’s embarrassing.)
