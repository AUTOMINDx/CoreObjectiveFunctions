Anyone else have a debilitating fear of discovering a mistake in your data/analysis years later and having a paper or someone else’s paper retracted?
I obsessively check over data again and again from years ago and can’t stop or ever convince myself it’s correct. Sometimes I can’t eat or sleep because I fear as an undergrad I might have made a dumb little mistake and someone’s else’s work will be void and retracted. I know it’s good to be careful and diligent but any advice for this consuming your every thought everyday? I feel like I’m going crazy. Therapy? Find a different line of work? Any thoughts would be helpful
