wooooo 28217373th shitty parents rant
father just told me I'm a fucking idiot and stupid, and a bunch other bullshit, honestly ima admit I let a tear out but it was like my body was sad but my mind couldn't give less of a shit, and my mom told me she wasnt gonna live her life taking care of her children anymore and she was just gonna live for herself (I'm 13 btw) how very responsible, I don't give a shit bout my parents anymore and was wondering if I should just straight up end my life or try to get better, honestly I don't have any ambitions or goals so even more reason to kms, I might do it tonight anyways, funny how I'm grinning rn at the thought of finally being free of living a shitty life and living on a third world country.
