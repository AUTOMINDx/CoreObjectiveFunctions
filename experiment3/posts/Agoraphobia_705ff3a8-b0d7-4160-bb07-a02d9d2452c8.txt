i got the job!
I went for my second ever interview today (was super anxious, didn’t sleep, vision was blurry and felt faint) but i still pushed myself to go and i walked there alone which was hard enough and i was offered the job on the spot! 

I’m so proud of myself and surprised that i have done this!! i’m also so nervous for working and being committed to something when i don’t know if my anxiety will be okay when i’m schedules to work. 

But i’m excited and hopeful that this is the start of getting better and that my anxiety and confidence will get better!
