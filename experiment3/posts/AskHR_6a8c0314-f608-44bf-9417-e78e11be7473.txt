[CA] Previous job did not pay out 200+ hours of accrued PTO when I quit.
I worked for a [MD] based non-profit for 5 or 6 years and took very little time off because I was an exempt regional director. My Operating site was in California, so it's not like I was working remotely. Do I have the right to tell them they owe me the accrued PTO? When I was quitting and training my replacement I tried to use PTO in order to lessen the weight of my final paycheck, but they denied my request for PTO and never paid me out. Part of me feels bad, but my salary was meager, I always had to take calls and work even if I was on PTO. I also want to protect the other CA employees and make sure the organization doesn't get slammed with a lawsuit. I'd prefer to maintain a healthy relationship with the organization. What should I do?
