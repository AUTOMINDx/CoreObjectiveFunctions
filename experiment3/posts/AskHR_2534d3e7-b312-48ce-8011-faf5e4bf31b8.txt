[CAN] How can I explain my grief to my supervisor?
I'm an independent contractor. I work from home.

I lost my husband at the end of Oct 2021 and it's been extremely difficult for me. Bouts of depression and crying. I have a hard time concentration as well.

My husband died very suddenly. We talked like normal during his night shift. Next thing I know the cops were at my door to tell me had died. It was traumatic.

Onto the work issue: I explained this situation to many of my coworkers and superiors. All expressed empathy and understanding except one person.

On a project I was working on, I explained to this person that it was more difficult for me to answer messages as I was busy with notary appointments and family meetings. I apologized and explained that I would be slower in responding, as I was prioritizing my mental health.

This person did not respond.

3 days later, another message. "Please respond to my request. Do not ignore me"

I understand my responses are important and I do respond, but if I'm in bed crying, I feel frozen in time and can't do anything.

How can I explain to this person my situation while sounding professional?

Thank you.
