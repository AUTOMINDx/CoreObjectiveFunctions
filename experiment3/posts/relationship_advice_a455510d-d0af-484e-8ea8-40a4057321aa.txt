I (21F) moved in with older male colleague, dad is acting jealous and it’s extremely creepy.
I had a really strict upbringing and was never allowed to talk to or befriend males as my father would get livid over it, but recently I got a job a receptionist at this law firm and I’ve befriended a colleague. 

He heard about my upbringing and apparently it reminded him of a kid he use to foster, so he offered that I could share his apartment if I pay a third of the bills (his wife use to pay a third of bills and rent but she lives away for work) so I agreed because getting some adult experience of like having a roommate would probably be a good experience. 

I didn’t tell my dad he was a man because I knew he’d be angry, but when he found out he started calling me a wh*re and a sl*t and saying that I was a typical woman and that I have no loyalty to him or to our “relationship” and that I was a cheating bi*ch before he knew he was already demanding a key and the security code and calling me every hour and a half. 

He tried to show up to the apartment and called my roommate a sl*t stealing pig and I’m freaked out, he seems jealous in a romantic way and it’s really weird and uncomfortable, I feel like I need some advice but I don’t know who to talk to, it’s extremely uncomfortable and I’m really worried.
