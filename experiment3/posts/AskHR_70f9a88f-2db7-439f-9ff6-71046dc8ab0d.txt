Took PTO from me?? [AZ]
Hello. I work at a vegan manufacturing place for subscription based meals. I have been planning a trip around my accrued paid time off. I became part time in august and went to my pto tab yesterday and while it had previously showed 48 hours, it was completely gone. My job uses gusto, and even if we had zero hours the tab would still be there. I went to my manager who said that she will call the company and let me know what was up by the end up the day. She informed me that she was still able to see my accrued PTO and it was 30 hours. The reasoning she gave me was that when I switched to part time, I was accidentally still accruing the PTO of 2.15 hrs. My paystub today didnâ€™t even show the section for my unused paid time off, but my paystub from December 13th shows that i had 48 hours, and the paystubs previously were adding up to that. Are they obligated to give me those hours? Do I suck it up? Please let me know if you have advice.
