FWB dirty talk during sex
First time posting but really want some insight and advice on this issue. 

I met a guy about 6 months ago and we quickly became friends with benefits. We are both not ready for relationship but have admitted our feelings for one another (him more than me). I do like him but I know he has a lot going on, and honestly he can not give me the affection and attention I need in a serious relationship. 

We have intercourse a couple times a month and usually hang out as well and talk about anything and everything. It’s really nice and I’d like to continue this but when we have sex he says somethings that are a bit odd. It wasn’t so bad at first just like asking if he “is the best I’ve had” sexually and stuff but now he talks about getting married to him, getting pregnant, me moving into his place etc, mind you this all during sex and it’s very aggressive. 

Is this just a fetish or should I be concerned? He never use to say this stuff before but in the past 2 months it’s gotten progressively more intense. Otherwise our friendship is fine and he shows no signs of pushing for a relationship. 

Some side note: He has shown some jealousy in the past but nothing to extreme. We don’t go out on dates, his money is tight right now so that’s not really even an option.  I know I’m not his only fwb because I’m friends with his other fwb(there’s also a long story behind this too but not sure if it’s  relevant to all this. 

Ask for any information that I might not have mentioned..
