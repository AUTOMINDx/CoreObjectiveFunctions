Why do I revolve my life around one person if I get close with them
Idk if this is normal or not but when I would get close to someone emotionally I would make my entire life around them like I would isolate myself from everyone I know and idk why but for some reason I expect them to do the same I would get angry if they talked to other people idk why I feel this way it makes me feel like a horrible person is this normal ðŸ˜¥
