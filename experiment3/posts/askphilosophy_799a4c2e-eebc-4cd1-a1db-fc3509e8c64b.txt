Tips for a beginner who wants to read on the philosophy of mathematics?
Hello. I'm a student of mathematics. I've never read any philosophy other than wikipedia pages, so I basically know nothing, but I'm curious to learn more. I'm wondering if I could get some resources behind the philosophy of mathematics, maybe its history and currently accepted philosophies.
