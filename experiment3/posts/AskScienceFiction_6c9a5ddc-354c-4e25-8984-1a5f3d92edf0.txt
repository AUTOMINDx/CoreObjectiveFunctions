[Marvel] Given the number of super-geniuses in the Marvel Universe and the vast resources that many of them have, how is it that none of them have been able to successfully recreate the Super Soldier Serum?
* As many people know, the only person that is considered to have created a successful version of the [Super-Soldier Serum](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Super-Soldier_Serum) was it's original creator, [Abraham Erskine](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Abraham_Erskine_(Earth-616)). After his death, many people have tried to recreate the serum with varying degrees of success, but none of them have managed to create a version of the serum that is considered equal to the original.
* Abraham Erskine was rated has having a [level 5, or genius level of intelligence](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Abraham_Erskine_(Earth-616)#Powers_and_Abilities) as determined by the [official marvel power grid](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Grid)
* While this is indeed an impressive level of intelligence, it is by no means rare in the Marvel Universe, with numerous people being rated with the [same intelligence level](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Power_Grid/Intelligence/Genius), or [even](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Power_Grid/Intelligence/Super-Genius) [higher](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Power_Grid/Intelligence/Omniscient).
* Given that there are numerous people that are as smart or even smarter than Dr. Erskine, and given that many of them have access to far more sophisticated technology and vaster resources than he did, how is it that none of them have been able to successfully reproduce the Super Soldier serum?
