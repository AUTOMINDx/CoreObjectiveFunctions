Lets say a boy grows up knowing nothing about sex, groeing up no one told him about it at all, and he hasnt even accidentally come across it in a book or the internet. When he grows up, will he still instinctually know what to do when he sees a naked girl?
Will he just know he has to put his penis in her vagina?
