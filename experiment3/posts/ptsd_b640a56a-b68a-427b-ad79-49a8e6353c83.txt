My Abuser Won't Leave Me Alone and I'm About to Explode
All through my childhood, my sociopath of a father has terrorized me.  It's behind most of my PTSD, but guilt keeps in in a relationship with him, which I imagine is on "my terms" but he's a sociopath, so let's be real here.  


He is currently in town, and his best friend lives down the street from me, I know this was a reality I would just have to deal with.  It's not like this is unexpected.  


For the last 3 days I've had a migraine and could not leave bed. Today I came to work because he's still in town and I didn't want to be home alone as long as he's here.  When I was trying to explain to him, that NO, I could not and would not be seeing him, because I had a debilitating migraine, he was doing things like driving around my condo, honking his horn obnoxiously, and circling the block for at least 15 minutes (my partner was watching him).  This has left me on edge today.  


Already he's called me 3 times, I've only texted him "I'm at work." I will call him later, and while he says he "understands about my migraines" I'm really about to lose all the patience I have with him.  I wish he could at least respect my boundaries, but he won't.  And even if I do just go no contact, the harrassment will continue.  


All I have to say is that if he comes to the door, I'm calling the cops.  I don't know what I'll tell them? "My dad's at my door and I have a migraine, please remove him" but I'm over this.
