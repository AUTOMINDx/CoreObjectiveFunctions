Advice on how to deal with gf’s vaginal odour without upsetting her.
Sorry if this is inappropriate, but I’m just legitimately looking for help/advice. I’ve (M40) been with g/f (40) for almost two years now and she’s absolutely amazing. Loving, kind, supportive, everything you want really. But there’s one thing that is a problem (rightly or wrongly) and that’s when we have sex, her vagina often does not smell good at all. To the point where it turns me off so much I can’t continue and just have to ‘bring things to a close’. I’ve tried to drop subtle hints (suggested a feminine shower gel for example) but it’s so hard as I don’t want to upset her. I’ve never had to deal with this issue in previous relationships and I’m just worried that eventually it will start have a really bad affect on our relationship. Again, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for help, but if not then any advice would be much appreciated.
