Social anthropology compared to anthropology
I'm strongly considering going to study anthropology (I live in Sweden) but I'm a bit confused on the exact differences between social anthropology and anthropology. Are these distinctions that are broadly recognised as two different academic studies or is it a distinction specific to the university/to Sweden?
