At the time, how aware were people of Auschwitz and the atrocities that happened?
Was it well known amongst the German population of what occurred at these camps, or was it all successfully covered up?

I’ve started reading Man’s search for meaning, and on approach to the camp the passengers panic upon realising it’s Auschwitz. I previously thought the crimes of these camps weren’t widely known until after, but is that not the case?
