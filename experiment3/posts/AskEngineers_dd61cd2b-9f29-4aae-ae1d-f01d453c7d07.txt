Is it really beneficial to be exceptionally good at engineering?
Let me explain: Being very good at engineering will be helpful to land a job in this field and even get promotions. But I see that in Big companies, product managers and other Management positions get the highest salaries. So, it seems to me that skill level in engineering hits a point of diminishing return and at some point being very good at engineering doesn't translate to higher pay. At the end of the day, doing leadership stuff and directing projects and products (which don't involve much maths and physics) get the highest rewards even in technical companies.

I just completed high school and want to join electrical engineering, so it would be really helpful if you kind people tell me the answer to the title. (I might be wrong about some things I wrote. Please correct me if necessary.
