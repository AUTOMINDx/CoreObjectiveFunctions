My mum is hurting me...
I(17F) live with my dad, mum and younger sister. My mum is very controling person, she always needs to know where anyone is all the time (if you're just a little bit late it's a problem) but refuses to say where she goes. 

She demands very strange rules...I'm prohibited to eat at certain places and times, I can wash myself after certain hour etc. Sometimes she is angry at me for very strange reasons (I've got kicked from my house because I didn't take out the trash for her when she was at her friends house... I didn't know I was suppose to do that which I got replied to: "you should have figured it out")
Since I was a child she has been telling me that I look like I'm from holocaust, that I'm reason for my parents arguing and that she never should have had children. 

But that's not all... I'm very mentally ill I do have tics and OCD in level where I'm sometimes unable to hold a conversation, leave the house or touch objects. Since it gotten worse she started telling me I quote: "stop doing the weird thing with your hands because it reminds me that you're not normal." Or "People won't respect your problems you should get use to it"
I don't know what to do because I started blacking out for a moment and then find myself at strange places around my house. That is making my mum very angry. I don't know if I said something...
I can't control my behaviour and it's getting worse every day. She refuses to acknowledge that. It's hurting me deeply but I don't want to leave my sister wit her all alone.

Sorry if it was a bit messy it was hard for me to put my thoughts together. Also English is not my birth language.
