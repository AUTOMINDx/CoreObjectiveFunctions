Is the African Multi-Regional Hypothesis valid?
I read this interesting article at [*New Scientist*](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831750-200-origin-of-our-species-why-humans-were-once-so-much-more-diverse/) where it claimed that not only did homo sapiens experience two genetic bottlenecks upon leaving the continent and then when a meteor hit Siberia (or a mega volcano), but there was a mass loss in genetic diversity within Africa as well before humans left the continent.  The article called it the **African multi-regional hypothesis**.  The evidence the article uses says that there are wildly divergent homo sapiens skull shapes and sizes found all throughout the continent, but several thousand years before humans leave Africa, there's a homogenization of skull shapes and sizes and it's unknown what caused it.  This is considered yet another loss of genetic diversity for the human species.

Is this theory true or misguided and is there any more information on it?
