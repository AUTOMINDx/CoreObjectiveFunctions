Does it make sense to take a pay cut for a more appealing job
Am currently a systems engineer at a large defense company and have opportunity to go to a smaller company that likely has more interesting work with more responsibility as a design engineer but I would be making a little less money (\~90k to \~85k). I also may end up working a little more but not crazy hours either (like 40-&gt;45 but those extra 5 would be paid). 

My systems position was my first job out of college and it pays well, is low stress but I am bored and don't want to be doing this same work in 5-10 years. I basically only every write requirement and next up for me will be collecting verification artifacts as we go into testing. Does it make sense to take a short term pay cut in order to grow career in a way I think I want to? Or should I just continue to cash out on the easy money 

Anyone make a career switch like this and come to regret it?
