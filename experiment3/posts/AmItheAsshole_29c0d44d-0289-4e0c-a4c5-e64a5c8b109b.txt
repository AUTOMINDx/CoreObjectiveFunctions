AITA for giving the PS5 my Husband bought to my Nephew?
I am a 35 year old woman and my husband is 37, I discovered the other day he had bought a PS5 as a gift for himself, but the thing is he used *my* money to do so without my permission using a portion of my emergency savings that he had access to in case of you know, an emergency. Which I do not believe being able to get your hands on a new video game console classes as.

This led to a huge argument and I took the console away and reboxed it up, I debated on returning it to the shop for the money but I know my  sister has been struggling to find one for my 13 year old Nephew for over a year, so instead I wrapped it up and took it round to hers and put it under the tree and quietly explained what it was and what had happened, my sister then gave me the money for it. 

My husband went *ballistic* shouting and demanding I go get it back which I of course refused to do, telling him as it had been bought with my money it was my choice what happened to it. He is now sulking and refusing to talk to me and acting like a huge child.

Edit: For anyone curious about our money situation and why i'm so angry, we each put half our salary into a communal family fund for the house, bills, groceries etc. The other half is ours to play with as we want, my husband always blows through his and never saves a penny, half of my expendable money goes into savings for emergencies as i'm more realistic.

Second Edit: Stating here because of comments, He refused to pay me back as it was an "emergency"

Third Edit: I have emptied the emergency account that he has access to and put it all in my personal account that he does not have access to, including the money I got from my sister for the ps5.
