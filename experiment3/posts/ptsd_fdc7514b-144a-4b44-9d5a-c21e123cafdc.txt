TW/SA! I’m so stupid to let myself get sexually abused again.
I think my boyfriend is hurting me. I tell him I don’t want to do sexual things but he pushes me. One time, he wanted to eat me out, I told him “I’m uncomfortable with this, I don’t want to.” he then proceeded to spend the next couple of minutes with, “aw cmon. i’ll make you feel really good. you’ll like it. you know you want it.” and kissed my leg, then my thigh. My legs were closed because I didn’t want to be eaten out. WARNING TIMI. Then he spread my legs and ate me out! I looked away and tried to ignore it until he stopped. He has done this before, but he is nice. I’m not sure if it’s wrong. Maybe I’m trying to make him seem like a bad person cause I want drama or something. Am I making it up? Help me please
