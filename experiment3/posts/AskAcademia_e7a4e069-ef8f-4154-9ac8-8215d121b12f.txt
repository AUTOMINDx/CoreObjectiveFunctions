I got a rejection from a PhD application (again!). What am I doing wrong?
Hello, 
I do not think my background and experience are awful or something. I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Is there anyone here who made many applications and got rejected and knows why? Then maybe got accepted.

I am just extremely sad and started to lose my hope about getting a PhD.

Edit: I am in the field of Neuroscience and Psychology. I also apply for PhDs in BCI field.

What changed from the last year: I am just doing an internship now. It is unpaid and remote. I also graduated from masterâ€™s in 2019 and there is a 2 year gap in my CV.
