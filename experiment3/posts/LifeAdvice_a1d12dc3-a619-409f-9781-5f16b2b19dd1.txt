I think I’m losing it.
So English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry if there’s any mistake in the following text.
I think I’m on the verge of a breakdown and I really don’t know what to do. I never had an easy life but the past few months have been the most stable I’ve ever been.
I’m in college, I can actually pay my expenses, I’m doing something I love but for some reason i feel like there’s a hole in my chest. I cry myself to sleep every day, I have no friends who i can talk to and i feel so lonely it hurts. I wish i knew how to be ok with being with just me. 
Do you have any advice on how to overcome this feeling of desperation and loneliness that’s driving me insane?
