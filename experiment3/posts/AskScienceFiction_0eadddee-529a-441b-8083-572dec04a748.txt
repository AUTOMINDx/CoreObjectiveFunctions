[Star wars] Did Palpatine believe that Anakin was truly the chosen one? Or did he simply not care either way, as long as he got Anakin (a clearly powerful force user) to join him?
To clarify further than the title allows; Did Palpatine even believe or care about the chosen one prophecy, and believe Anakin was indeed the chosen one? 

Or was it a much simpler explanation of:

'I want Anakin to join me solely because he is clearly very powerful, and I can use him as I used Dooku' ? 

Was it a bit of column A and column B? 

TIA!(:
