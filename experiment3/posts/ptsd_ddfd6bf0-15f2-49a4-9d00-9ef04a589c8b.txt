Is it normal to have memory problems years after the trauma?
I was talking with my friend yesterday and he was naming all these things we did. They ranged from two years ago to five years ago. I don't remember these entire events. Of course chunks of my memory are missing from the time of the trauma, and some of my memories do come back after some years, but I don't know. Maybe it could be something else; just wondering if anyone else has experienced this.
