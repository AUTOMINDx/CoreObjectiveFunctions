Why is the assumption WFH requires no skill?
I have seen countless posts "I have no experience and would like a WFH remote job"

Don't get me wrong there are definitely some customer support jobs that are available but a lot of those have been turned over to other countries for 24-7 availability. 

Most if not all remote employees I work with are either very skilled employees or veteran employees who have earned respect and trust to work from home.

The idea that you can get a WFH job and just be paid to be lazy is insulting to people who actually want or do work hard WFH.

The remote listings are now being flooded with scams because and people will fall for fake jobs and then the narrative will be "WFH are scams".

I truly believe a lot if not most jobs can be done with Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Sending an email to someone 5 feet from you or 30 miles gets there in the same amount of time. Not to mention the benefits of having less cars on the road.
