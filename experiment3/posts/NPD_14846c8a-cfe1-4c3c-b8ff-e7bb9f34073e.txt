Change is such a slow process
I can try to somewhat change my behavior in a next interaction with somebody. The problem is that, no matter what I do, in the end I still feel that I’m doing it wrong. If it’s a choice I picked, it’s going to be bad. That’s so self defeating and I’m so tired. 

I’m tired of going on a date and playing this character of somebody who’s seductive and really on top of their game to make the person fall for me. Then I eventually lose interest because of something superficial and break it off. Then I eventually regain interest and they dump me. Good on them. But I myself hate this character I first played and just do it involuntarily. What a week it’s been.
