Perhaps controversial: this sub is a bit toxic
I'm not making this post against any of the moderators or the members here nor am I making this to discourage anyone from posting here

However, I think it must be said that many people just come here to vent about their deep longing and how they feel like no one will understand them or 'want' them. and I sympathize, I know that feeling too well.But the problem is when you get onto a sub where everyone is basically repeating the same toxic ideas "I'm unloved", "I will never be loved", "I hate people", "I'm unlikeable", "No one wants me" you're more likely to embed that in your mind even more. And it's not just the posts, when you go in the comments it's long comment threads all about how everyone thinks they're lonely or unloveable. This enforces the idea that owo certain people are just \*cursed\* to being lonely for whatever reason and they'll never outgrow it

obviously, this isn't all posts, maybe not even most. but it's prominent for sure.

So here's my reminder to you that no you're not impossible to love, no you shouldn't hate people, no not everyone will hate you. even IF you are a terrible person  (which most of you aren't at all) you can change!!

please take what you see on Reddit with a grain of salt and learn it's far far far far from a replacement for therapy
