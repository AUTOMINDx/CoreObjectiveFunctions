Is there a way to block something from being photographed?
Hi. I’m an art student from Brazil and I’m working on a project for college. I’m not sure if this is even the right subreddit for it (and if you can think of one more appropriate, please, let me know in the comments) but here it goes:

I wanted to create a painting that could not be photographed. Part of me wish I could use some special ink that bends light with nanotech or something (yeah, too much Sci-Fi movie-watching), but I was thinking of something more feasible, such as a panel that goes in front of the painting with some material that would distort a photo or something. Is there any real way of achieving it?

Thanks :)
