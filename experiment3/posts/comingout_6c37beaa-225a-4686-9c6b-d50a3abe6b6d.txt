I feel like nothing changed
Hi, so like a month or so ago I came out to my mom about being agender, aroace and my pronouns being they/them. She didn’t respond in any way and as the days went by, she still called me by she/her pronouns and even though I tried to reinforce my pronouns, she told me that itd take a long time for her to grasp them. It’s been a long time now and she still calls me a girl and by she/her pronouns. It makes me so upset. I feel like nothing ever changed and I was nervous for no reason what so ever as it seems like she doesn’t care at all. I understand it’s hard but can’t she just try her best to use my correct pronouns? I don’t get it. I don’t know what to do now.
