[TX] Received an offer but terminated prior to final interview
I applied for a position while still employed and went through two interviews. Prior to the final interview I was let go by my employer. I did not bring this up in the final interview because it was a meet and great with two other members of the team, not the hiring manager or supervisor. 

I received an offer and am excited about it but am worried about this issue, The HR lady that sent the offer asked  *"Once you have cleared background, when are you available to start?Â  Would it be a 2 week notice, 3 week notice, etc.? "* and I'm not sure how to answer. I'm available to start whenever they want but should I let her know about the termination prior to initiating the background check? Please advise as I don't want to blow this opportunity. Thank you.

Edit: Thank you all for the feedback/responses!
