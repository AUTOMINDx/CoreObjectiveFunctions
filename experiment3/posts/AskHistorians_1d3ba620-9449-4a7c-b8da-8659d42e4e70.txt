In Chinese Feng Shui buildings must be built with doors facing south for bedrooms, west for kitchens, and other very specific rules for how buildings can be designed. Is there a historical reason for this?
These rules seem very specific and part of me wonders if there is a practical and historical reasoning for these rules that had spiritual meaning layered on top of it over time.

Are there any Chinese historians that can shed light on the reasoning?
