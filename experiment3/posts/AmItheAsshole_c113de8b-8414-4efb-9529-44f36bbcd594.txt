AITA for not letting someone move into my bedroom which I don't use after they were outed and disowned?
Context: My mother came out as bi when she was younger and was disowned by her parents when she started dating a women. My grandmother came back into her life once my mother had my older sister and me. My sister caught on quicker and chose to disassociate her. I was younger and didn't know. Due to this I was named the sole inheritor to everything my grandmother owned, including her house. My grandmothers final spiteful move against my mother it seems.

I (f18) recently started college and got a scholarship which included living on campus. I thought it would be a good idea for me to get out of my comfort zone and have a level of independence.

My sisters best friend 'Jen' (21f) was recently disowned by her family after being outed so she spent thanksgiving with us/staying with us. Obviously my mother has taken Jen in. The day after thanksgiving my mum told me that Jen will be permanently moving in. Both her and my sister go to school about 30 minutes away so it's more convenient. My mum told me that she is going to give Jen my room as its not convenient for her and my sister to share a room.

Up until this point I was on board and felt bad but I had a problem with this. We have a 3/4 bedroom house, the fourth one is currently being used as a storage room. I don't think its fair for me to be displaced when there is a room she can move into. The stuff inside of it can easily be moved into closets around the house and is a big room. My mother argued that I go to school 6 hours away and will only be home a couple of weeks out of the year and its selfish to keep my room. Jen also likes the fact that my room has a balcony and stated she liked being on the same level as everyone else/felt isolated sleeping on the ground floor. I said that she was prioritising someone else over her own child and she said I didn't have a say because I'd never be discriminated against based on my sexuality and didn't know what its like to be disowned because of it. I told her I felt like she was disowning me right now and there was a bedroom for Jen to move into but she couldn't have my room.

Next day rolls around and Jen starts thanking me for letting her move into my room and starts talking about redecorating, painting etc. I'm confused and tell her that's not happening and that there was a bedroom downstairs if she wanted to move in. My mum and sister both got angry and I was getting overwhelmed and shouted 'I won't let you kick me out of my own home. That is my bedroom and will continue to be my bedroom. If you want to choose Jen over me, go live in another house and have your family there.' Apparently now I've made Jen feel unwelcome and she thinks I hate her because of her sexuality. My mum and sister keep making comments about being 'inhospitable' and 'can't believe she pulled the 'I own this house' even though she doesn't pay any bills'.

I have paid the tax on the house through inheritance money and we live in my grandmothers house.
