Contacting an (attempted) savior 19 years after Nmom cut her out of our lives.
In 2003 I was 12 and my Nmother and I went to visit a friend of hers from high school for a couple weeks. You all know that nparents act differently outside the family home and in front of others. But when you're both staying overnight with someone else, they can't hide it as well and eventually it comes out. My mother's friend witnessed her behavior towards me and took me aside and asked me if I was being abused. No one had ever asked me anything like that before and I was scared and I had no idea what to say. And to be honest, nearly 19 years later, I don't remember what I said to her. 

When we got back home, my mother and her friend had a huge falling out. From what I remember of what my mother told me, the friend had accused my mother of abusing me and my mother cut her out. I remember being scared, like a secret had been found out. As far as I know, they never spoke again, but I had found a hand written letter from friend to my mother apologizing. Looking back, it looks like my mother gaslit the hell out of her. 

For the past few years I've been digging through my memory trying to remember anything about her so I could find her and thank her for being one of two people to ever say anything to my mother. (The other was my ballet teacher when I was 7 or 8). Well, I think ive finally found her. I sent her a Facebook message asking if she knew me or my mother and now I'm just waiting. 

I'm scared because what if I'm making it up? What if she doesn't remember? What if she still believes my mother? I'm glad I messaged her, but it's making me anxious. I'm just trying to keep my fingers crossed. 

Wish me luck &lt;3
