Worked 70 hours a week running heavy equipment. What's something thats not construction that makes something similar with no degree?
No college degree. So as the title says I'm coming from running heavy equipment 70 hours a week, about $70-80K a year 6 days a week was most of my life in my early 20's. Really dangerous, toxic co-workers/environment and super stressful.  Tried quitting to pursue the idea of starting my own business but it ended up not panning out.  I am pretty tech savvy but have a really hard time taking in learning from just staring at a screen. I have tried some of the google courses but it really didn't stick with me as I tried it for a couple months to progress in them.

I am really just feeling pretty small in this big world and don't really have anything that sticks to me to pursue. Something that I think I would like to do would to be someone's personal assistant  trying to do all the things someone can't do while working, But I have no idea where to look for a job like that.

I live in a pretty high cost of living area so finding a decent job would be ideal but most of what I've seen on indeed hasn't been promising as most of its construction related and I know that I cannot go back to working in that industry again.

I guess looking for some suggestions from some people that don't have any degree that like their job and not hate it everyday.

Happy Holidays to everyone struggling right now. I am right there with y,all!
