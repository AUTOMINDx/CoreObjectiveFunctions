How long do you give a new job before determining if you like it?
I started my first job post grad about 5 months ago, and i'm pretty miserable. There's nothing really wrong with the company, and my co-workers/managers are nice for the most part, but i'm not really enjoying the work I'm doing and don't find it particularly satisfying or interesting. I'm also thinking that the company isn't a good fit for me as it can be pretty fast-paced and is client facing which I don't like too much.

I know 5 months isn’t that long to be at job, especially a first job from college but I’m just wondering if I need to give it more time with the hopes that it’ll grow on me? I am thinking about looking for another job, but I'm not even really sure what kind career I'm interested in pursuing or if I would even find any job satisfying. Is this just what working is like and I should stick it or should I be looking elsewhere? Would appreciate any advice anyone has.
