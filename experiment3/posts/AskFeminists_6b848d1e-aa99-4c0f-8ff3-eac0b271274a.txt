Should I as a guy be fighting incels over feminist topics even if I barely know any feminism? How do I effectively fight their "loneliness kills" argument?
The first question is basically just title. I feel like I'm hugely underequipped to be doing this but I regularly find myself sounding like a stereotypical (in the mind of a guy) feminist when I challenge guys with poor perspective and priorities around gender. Is it a "take any help we can get" sort of situation? The second question is something I've run into at a ridiculous frequency, like half of my exchanges with people who I unfairly call incels because of my negative attitude toward their response to women's issues being brought up... 

The conversation always goes like this; women's issues discussed, man comes in and says that men are suffering too, I explain that (for example) that there is a terror/threat of physical harm component to women's struggles (such as not knowing if rejecting a catcaller can lead to violence), their response is, as if by copy paste, always "loneliness kills too you know". This response is so common and yet so horribly unbalanced and pathetic that I straight up don't know how to respond beside berating them (which causes them to think they won the argument because I got mad). And the exact reason I'm posting this question here is that someone probably thinks this shit is stupid in the same way as me but has more insight.

I would love some advice on how to respond to this. It's so bad that I can't even begin to address everything wrong with saying "men suffer too, physical violence at any time? nah we have it just as bad we can't get laid". There has to be some way to tell them this in a way that they'll be receptive.
