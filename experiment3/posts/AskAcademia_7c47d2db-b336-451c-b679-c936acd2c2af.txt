What should I say if my supervisor asked me if I'm willing to work over the winter break?
So our winter break is from Dec 18 to Jan 2. However, my supervisor just asked me if I want to push for a paper deadline on Jan 15. They realize that there is a lot of work to be done if we were to meet that deadline. I don't know how to respond because I was shocked that they were trying to take away my break.
