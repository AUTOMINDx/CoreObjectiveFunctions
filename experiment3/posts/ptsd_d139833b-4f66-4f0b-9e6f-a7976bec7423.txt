"Dating someone who has been loved by their parents, in a complete and unconditional way is very challenging for me.... It's not challenging for me to love them, it's challenging for me to explain why I am how I am."
Saw this post on twitter and it feels fitting to post it on this sub. I feel like i misunderstood most of my relationships with friends and others because of trauma, and because i understand love in a different way, it's hard to relate to others.
