Psychiatrist told me that only girls cut themselves
I was sent by the ER to a mental health hospital self willing because I just had enough.. I was extremely stressed out and depressed on the verge of psychosis.. So I was sent to the head psychiatrist of the hospital for an evaluation and he basically said that nothing is wrong with me.. Then he saw cuts on my arms, looked me straight in my eyes and said "do you know that only girls do that?" and there was also some belittling.. I just laughed it off and was basically sent home.. I'm doing better now if you wonder.. That was years ago and I just wanted to get this of my chest.. What are your thoughts?
