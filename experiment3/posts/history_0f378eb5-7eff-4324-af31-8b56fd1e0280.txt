Did any of the Soviet troops on the German border at the time of Operation Barbarossa later participate in the battles of Moscow, Leningrad, or Kiev, or were they all destroyed/rendered combat ineffective in the first weeks?
It is well known that the Soviet Red Army suffered colossal losses in the first months of the war in massive encirclements such as the one in Kiev, with hundreds of thousands of soviet troops being taken prisoner. The Soviet Union famously managed to raise hundreds of fresh divisions to help stem the German advance. What is little discussed however, are the Soviet formations that maintained a fighting retreat all across the western Soviet Union. Presumably these existed, as otherwise the Soviets would have had country-sized gaps in their front lines. Does anyone know anything on the subject?
