[Hawkeye]Did Rogers The Musical need to get permission to use the Avengers likenesses?
Thor probably not as he is most likely not a legal entity in the US.  Tony and Nat being dead means their estates would control the Likeness Rights.  Bruce controls his but Hulk might be a grey area.  Scott controls his but most likely would have been thrilled to be included despite not even being in NY at the time.

Clint most likely wouldn't have agreed but may have signed away certain rights as an agent of Shield.

How would Likeness Rights work with the Avengers?
