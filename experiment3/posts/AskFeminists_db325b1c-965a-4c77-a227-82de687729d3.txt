What resources can I use to introduce intersectional feminism terminology, topics and issues to a less-informed audience?
I volunteered to moderate the first of a series of discussions about intersectional feminism and LGBTQ+ topics in the leftist community* I frequent. This community has a long history of extra-institutional, anti-capitalist political activity, but many (especially older) members are not as familiar with feminism, or, rather, with transfeminism and intersectionality in general. Hence the need of a political and educated discussion of such themes. 

It's been asked that the first assembly be an introductory one, so that everyone can be part of more complex and nuanced discussions later, with books or articles as starting points. I was thinking of first explaining the terminology used in handling themes such as feminism, intersectionality, gender identity, sexual orientation, types of relationships, asexuality vs allosexuality and so on. While I do have a good degree of general knowledge about this, I would like to find some already prepared resources to save some time and be sure to cover as much as I can. I'm sure some articles or books or websites cover these topics with a similar approach, do you happen to know where I can find them? 

* Such a community is a "centro sociale" in Northern Italy. For those unfamiliar with the term, social centres are physical spaces, either occupied or granted by agreements with local institutions, where a community aggregates and builds a free, autonomous and self-organised fragment of society.
