what should i do with my girl who jealous for no reason and its making my life hard
am a 22yo male dating this really beautiful girl she is 3 years older than me and she is done with school all together,  we are still online dating and never met she doesn't live that far but come up with excuses when i tell her to meer , recently she has been having really bad jealousy episodes to the point where am no longer friends with 90% of my female friends anymore , i lost really good friends for her just to make her feel better but she is still having them making my life hard ,i do not show interest in other girls even tho i get alot of attention from girls specially when i post so i stopped posting , but every time she talks cold and act weird even tho i always express my feeling thing i never did in my last relationship,  what should i do and is it gonna get better ?
