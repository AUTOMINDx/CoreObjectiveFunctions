AMA with Dr. Matthew Gabriele and Dr. David Perry, authors of the new book "The Bright Ages: A New History of Medieval Europe"
Howdy! We’re 2 medieval historians and authors of the brand new (just out December 7) [*The Bright Ages: A New History of Medieval Europe*](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-bright-ages-matthew-gabrieledavid-m-perry?variant=39299550773282) with Harper Books. [Matthew Gabriele](https://profgabriele.com/) is a professor of medieval studies and chair of the Department of Religion and Culture at Virginia Tech. [David M. Perry](https://www.davidmperry.com/) was formerly a professor of history at Dominican University, but now is a journalist, medieval historian, and senior academic advisor in the history department at the University of Minnesota. 

We’ve both been interested for a long time not just in what happened in medieval Europe, but in how the Middle Ages are remembered and used in the modern world. Before this book, we’d published stuff in [*The Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/01/07/donald-trump-jrs-rifle-shows-how-obsessed-right-still-is-with-crusades/), [*Smithsonian Magazine*](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/did-the-vikings-actually-torture-victims-with-the-brutal-blood-eagle-180979148/), [*The Daily Beast*](https://www.thedailybeast.com/history-will-judge-trump-but-weve-got-to-do-it-first?ref=home), and on [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/09/opinions/ted-lasso-season-2-perry-gabriele/index.html), but we wanted with this book to step back, take a broader view, and return to the Middle Ages themselves. And what *The Bright Ages* does is to shine light on the period, to counter the zombie myth of the “Dark Ages” by showing medieval Europe in all its color, all its humanity. 

&gt;The word “medieval” conjures images of the “Dark Ages”—centuries of ignorance, superstition, stasis, savagery, and poor hygiene. But the myth of darkness obscures the truth; this was a remarkable period in human history. The Bright Ages recasts the European Middle Ages for what it was, capturing this 1,000-year era in all its complexity and fundamental humanity, bringing to light both its beauty and its horrors.   
&gt;  
&gt;*The Bright Ages* takes us through ten centuries and crisscrosses Europe and the Mediterranean, Asia and Africa, revisiting familiar people and events with new light cast upon them. We look with fresh eyes on the Fall of Rome, Charlemagne, the Vikings, the Crusades, and the Black Death, but also to the multi-religious experience of Iberia, the rise of Byzantium, and the genius of Hildegard and the power of queens. We begin under a blanket of golden stars constructed by an empress with Germanic, Roman, Spanish, Byzantine, and Christian bloodlines and end nearly 1,000 years later with the poet Dante—inspired by that same twinkling celestial canopy—writing an epic saga of heaven and hell that endures as a masterpiece of literature today.    
&gt;  
&gt;*The Bright Ages* reminds us just how permeable our manmade borders have always been and of what possible worlds the past has always made available to us. The Middle Ages may have been a world “lit only by fire” but it was one whose torches illuminated the magnificent rose windows of cathedrals, even as they stoked the pyres of accused heretics.  

And that last bit, we think, is really important. The European Middle Ages are not a period that needs universal condemnation, but neither does it need rescuing and praise. The period was filled with people who made decisions, who created beauty and art, but also committed atrocities. The fullness of the past is what we’re after, told in a fun, accessible way that has something for those who know something about the period as well as those who know nothing (yet). 

&gt;A review in [*Slate*](https://slate.com/culture/2021/12/medieval-history-revised-review-of-the-book-the-bright-ages.html) said “While all of this is the sort of stuff that professional medievalists love to see, the thing I like most about Perry and Gabriele’s effort is that it is fun. The Bright Ages is written in such an engaging and light manner that it is easy to race through. I found myself at the end of chapters faster than I wanted to be, completely drawn in by the narrative. You can tell how much the authors love the subject matter, and that they had a great time choosing stories to share and evidence to consider.”  
&gt;  
&gt;And podcaster [Mike Duncan](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/) said “*The Bright Ages* shines a light on an age too often obscured by myth, legend, and fairy tales. Traveling easily through a thousand years of history, *The Bright Ages* reminds us society never collapsed when the Roman Empire fell, nor did the modern world wake civilization from a thousand-year hibernation. Gabriele and Perry show the medieval world was neither a romantic wonderland nor a deplorable dungeon, but instead a real world full of real people with hopes, dreams, and fears making the most of their time on earth.”
