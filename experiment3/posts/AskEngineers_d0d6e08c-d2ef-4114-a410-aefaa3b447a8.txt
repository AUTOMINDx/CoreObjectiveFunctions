WFH Engineers- How much time do you actually spend working per week?
I'm looking at fully remote positions. Currently I spend a good amount of time in the office just wasting time to "make my 40". I'd love to just get my work done and be done. As fully WFH engineers, do you ever feel obligated to work longer hours?
