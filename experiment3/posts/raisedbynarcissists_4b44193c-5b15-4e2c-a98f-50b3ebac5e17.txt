Nmom taking me to court
My nmom tries to act like she is my daughter’s mother instead of me and is taking me to court for partial custody of my daughter. I got a lawyer to represent me and I’m going into debt to protect my daughter from my nmom, but no matter what I’m told that with grandparents rights in my state I can’t keep her away from my daughter completely. I’m worried the court is going to grant her visitation even if they don’t grant her partial custody. I don’t want my nmom to have any influence on my daughter and I am afraid the court will say I have to let her have visitation with my daughter without me present. I’m really freaking out, and I haven’t been able to sleep without having nightmares. There’s nothing else I can do to prep for court, so I’ve just been falling into a pit of anxiety.
