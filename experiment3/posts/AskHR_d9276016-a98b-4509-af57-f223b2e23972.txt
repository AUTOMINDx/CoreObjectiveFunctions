[PA] Ordered to do something dangerous by supervisor, supervisor refused to listen to reasoning, repeatedly hung up phone then wrote me up for insubordination.
Hello, 

I work for a local trucking company in PA as a driver. Two months ago, I was Ordered by my supervisor to unload my truck in the middle of a dangerous street with a blind curve and a high speed limit where numerous accidents have occurred. I was told by another supervisor to never ever unload at that location and to instead go around to the back of the facility, but this supervisor is telling me to unload it here. When I tried to explain the situation, the supervisor repeatedly hung up the phone and would not let me finish and when I asked to speak to the safety manager he refused.

When I came back to the office later that day, the supervisor was incredibly taunting, saying that if I give you an order you need to do it and I'm writing you up for insubordination. Yes I hung up on you because I don't have time to deal with your nonsense and I'd do it again.

A week after, I had a hearing with the same supervisor and his superior, and the supervisor continued to act taunting and would not let me get a word in to the superior. The superior sided with the supervisor, saying if they tell you to do something you need to do it. If you feel it's Unsafe or wrong, you wait until you come back to the office to bring it up. The supervisor on duty supercedes anything a supervisor in the past has told you to do.

So I basically have to put myself in a dangerous and potentially liable situation?? I only ever have a problem with this one supervisor out of the 12 other ones and it's always him trying to find something to create a scene out of it and consistently screams and degrades me everyday. Is this not workplace harassment? What are my options?

And I cant resign as I'm locked into a contract.
