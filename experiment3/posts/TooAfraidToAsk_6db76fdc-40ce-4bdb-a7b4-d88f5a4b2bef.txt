New Adult Here: How Am I Supposed To Pay All These Bills??
I live very frugally, and was doing okay, but my employer just handed out open enrollment for health insurance and... It's so expensive. Almost $500/month just for me. That's an insane amount of money, almost 25% of my income. And when you factor in rent, utilities, car costs, and saving for retirement... How do you afford all this?
