Trying to figure out what I wanna be "when I grow up"
I'm 28F, so grown but I still don't know what I want to do with my life. Some background info on me.

Have HS diploma. Went to college back in 2014, stopped going due to depression. GPA is like 2.8 because I just let the classes fail instead of withdrawing. Can't afford to go back without grants because I can't get grants due to low GPA. And don't really want a whole bunch of student loans. 

I like my current job to an extent but simply put, it does not pay enough and it never will. And it's only part-time (it's a cafe type job but I do behind the scene stuff as well)

I'm looking for a decent balance of "hey I actually don't dread getting up every morning" and making decent money (like $20 an hour) 

I'm looking for a career I can do with either just my HS diploma or a certification. 

My passion is animals but unfortunately, no animal job I know pays well unless you have a degree of some sort unless I got super lucky. 

Things I'm currently considering are pharmacy tech, registered behavior tech (I like the idea of working with kids with autism), and some healthcare type jobs I can get with a certificate. And I'm still keeping an eye out on Indeed for animal related jobs.

I don't want a traditional office job, I had one for 3 years and became very miserable. 

If y'all wonderful people have any insight or maybe a job/career that I'm not thinking of, I would love any help. I feel very lost right now and I'm hoping I can find a solution eventually.
