Does alcohol tolerance actually decrease when you go sober?
Title pretty much says it all. I was a pretty heavy drinker for the past few years, but I've been mostly sober for almost 3 months now and I was wondering if the tolerance I've built up is actually going to go down over time or if it'll just be a psychosomatic thing since I'm no longer getting hammered regularly.
