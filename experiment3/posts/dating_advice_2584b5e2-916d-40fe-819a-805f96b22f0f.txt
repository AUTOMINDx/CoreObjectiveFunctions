Straight women not interested? I'm a bisexual man. The only people who want to date me are fellas, queer women, and nonbinary people. I mean I'm not complaining. It's just wierd. Whats going on?
Well I am kind of complaining. Mostly because the majority of the time queer women unsure of whether they are interested in men usually end up dating me. This would be fine, except it means they don't want anything too intimate, or at least the relationship never lasts long enough for them to warm up to the idea of actually being intimate with a man. Idk. It is all very wierd and keeps happening over and over. How do I start dating a straight woman so I can break the cycle?
