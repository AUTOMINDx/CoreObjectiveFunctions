What would be the effect on the development of life on earth if a human body was sent millions of years into the past?
Let's say I'm building a time machine, and there's an accident. I'm blasted millions of years into the past, and I'm stuck there. I haven't got anything with me: no clothes, technology, or anything. Just my body and nothing else.

What kind of effect would this have on the development of life on earth? I'm not talking about the butterfly effect, as in what effect would my actions have on later history: my question is more about biology and the ecosystem. 

Would the introduction of the DNA, microbiome, etc. of a modern human into the distant past have an impact on the development of life on earth? Or would nothing much change at all?

I suppose if my body was sent back within the last 500 million years there might not be much impact, but what if it was sent back 2000 million, or 3000 million years?
