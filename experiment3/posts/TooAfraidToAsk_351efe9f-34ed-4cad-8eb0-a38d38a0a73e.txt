Is what this girl does creepy?
OP here, extra info

Theres this girl and shes a junior in college (16) and im a freshman in college (18) and shes liked me for a long time. And shes super obsessive over everything and controlling even though we aren't dating. I talked to her about her actions and I told her they were creepy which she said they weren't. Some of these actions include screenshotting my parents instagram stories (whenever I am in one of the stories), she somehow has a picture of my closet with my clothes (she has never been to my house), etc. I feel as if because she is younger than me and a female and I am a male, most people will view this as fine. But if the roles were reversed and I was doing this I think I would likely be classified as a pedophile/perv. Do you guys think her behavior is creepy/obsessive.
