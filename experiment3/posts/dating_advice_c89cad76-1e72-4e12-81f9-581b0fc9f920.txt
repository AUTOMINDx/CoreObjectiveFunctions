Is it weird to give someone your # on a piece of paper and then walk away?
Context:

I (26F) was in a store talking to a male staff member. We were having a pleasant chat and I thought he was cute.

I think hitting on people who are working can be unpleasant as the recipient is trapped.

After he cashed me out I handed him my number, said “have a good day” and then I left. I felt that would put the least pressure on him.
