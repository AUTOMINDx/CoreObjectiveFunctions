Does anyone here suffer from physical symptoms daily such as fatigue, malaise, and headaches? Depression possibly is the cause for this? Does anyone else relate?
Hello and thanks for taking time to read this. For many years I have suffered from anxiety since childhood. In my teen years I became depressed. In my 20s the depression sunk it's teeth deeper to the point that I couldn't enjoy much anymore. Now in my very early 30s I am experiencing physical symptoms daily. Fatigue, malaise, headaches, loss of interest in everything. I experience no windows of joy or contentment.

What is wrong with me? Cancer, diabetes, tumors!? It can't just be depression...Does anyone relate?

I have some blood labs from the previous years if anyone cares to look at them. 2 doctors say I am fine and just depressed...
