How crazy of an idea were nuclear weapons before they were invented?
For example, today the spaceship warfare seems like a pretty crazy idea, and mainly exists in the sci-fi era. However things like nuclear fusion seems like a very real possibility today.

So how do these ideas compare to things like the nuclear weapons before it was invented?

Any answers besides nuclear weapons, like weaponized aeroplanes are also welcomed.
