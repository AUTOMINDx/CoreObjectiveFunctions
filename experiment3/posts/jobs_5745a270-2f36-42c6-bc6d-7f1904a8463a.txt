I gave them a week notice I was quitting. Tomorrow is my last day and no one has responded to me. Fuck em.
This is my first professional job. I work in the engineering field. I’m a tech. I told them September 4th I am moving to a different state and requested a transfer. I told them specifically December 29th I’m moving and would like an answer by December 4th. They have been stringing me along this whole time telling me I “should” get a call from the office I want to work in “sometime this week.”

I’m the only woman here of a team of 30 in the electrical field and I feel like they don’t listen to me or care about me at all. It’s so annoying. I’ve had so much anxiety about whether or not I’d get a transfer, but it seems to me they keep stringing me along so I can just quit. 


I found a new job with a $8 raise and a $2,000 sign on and a work from home position. Emailed my boss a week ago my last day will be in a week. No response. Good enough for me. Peace out. Don’t really care about their reference anyways.
