SD CARD READ ERROR
This morning I was using my GoPro, took some cool shit &amp; now when I plug it into my computer nothing shows.

When I insert the SD card into my GoPro - it now says SD Card error please reformat 

I have used some software which has shown the content but ideally donâ€™t want to pay $200 - is there any hacks to get it back please?

Thanks
