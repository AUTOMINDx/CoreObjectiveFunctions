What is the actual purpose of the Jupiter Return?
What is it supposed to 'teach'?

I know it brings expansion to the house it returns in but what is the actual purpose of it?

If the Saturn Return is associated with 'growing up' and major life changes what would be the Jupiter equivalent?

Can the Jupiter Return be linked to the lessons of the Saturn Return?

Is it possible for Jupiter Return to not be tied to a major event/life transition?
