What did kings actually do?
Whenever we think of a king, we think of an individual dressed in opulent clothes and pimped-out cape, sitting on a fancy chair. However, in reality, I'd reckon that kings were a lot more active other than just sitting and dishing out sentences. Did they oversee some projects? Did they have a private study? What percentage of time did they actually spend sitting on the throne?
