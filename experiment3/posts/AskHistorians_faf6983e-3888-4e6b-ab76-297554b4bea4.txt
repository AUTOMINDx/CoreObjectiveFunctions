It is widely known here that the mediaeval aversion to bathing is a myth. But what was mediaeval bathhouse culture like? How common were baths? How affordable were they? Were they merely places to wash, or were they also places for socialising (like the Roman baths of olden days)?
How similar (or how different) were medieval European bathhouses to their Roman counterparts? I am aware that the Middle Ages were long, and spanned a vast area, which makes it difficult to generalise things. But I'm just looking for an overview.
