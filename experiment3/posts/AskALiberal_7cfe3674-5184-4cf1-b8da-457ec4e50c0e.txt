What is the best way to combat wage theft?
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_theft):

&gt;Wage theft is the denial of wages or employee benefits rightfully owed to an employee. It can be conducted by employers in various ways, among them failing to pay overtime; violating minimum-wage laws; the misclassification of employees as independent contractors, illegal deductions in pay; forcing employees to work "off the clock", not paying annual leave or holiday entitlements, or simply not paying an employee at all.

Wage theft is a huge issue, far outstripping property theft. In [2012](https://www.epi.org/publication/wage-theft-bigger-problem-forms-theft-workers/), $341 million was stolen in property, while wage theft was reported at $933 million, and was likely far higher.

Given that theft is a crime and this a huge amount of stolen money, what is the best way to combat wage theft? Current laws and enforcement are obviously not working.
