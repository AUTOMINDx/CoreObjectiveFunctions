Is the story of the French Balloon Duel in 1808 true?
I've found many [articles](https://www.geriwalton.com/a-french-balloon-due/) on the internet describing the story of a duel between two Frenchmen, Monsieur de Grandpré and Monsieur le Pique, who decided to settle a dispute over a lover by having a balloon duel. The story goes that the men constructed identical balloons and went up in the air at 9 o'clock in the morning with their seconds and armed with blunderbusses. The balloons ascended from the gardens of Tuileries surrounded by a crowd of curious onlookers who thought they were observing a balloon race. After a signal was given, le Pique fired the first shot and missed. Grandpré then fired, who's shot hit its mark and le Pique’s balloon collapsed and descended with “fearful rapidity” who then hit a house top and were "dashed to pieces."

This story sounds insane, but I could believe it actually happened in this wacky world of ours. It seems that the source for this story is a newspaper article: “A Balloon Duel,” in *Buckingham Advertiser and Free Press*, 25 April 1863, p. 2. Notably, this article was published 55 years after the fact, so I'm curious how accurate this story is?

Another source I found was The Book Of Days, by Robert Chalmers, published 1863, [page 809 of volume 1](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=2LIMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA809&amp;dq=book+of+days+pique+grandpre&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hv-RT-H3HInsmAXUzITVAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).
