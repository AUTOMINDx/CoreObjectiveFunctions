[Men in Black] why would aliens want to come to Earth?
It's a less advanced planet where aliens have to live in hiding. It seems only good for fugitives and anyone else that needs to stay low.

And if so... Why would the men in black allow aliens at all? 

It seems like they are bringing a lot of heat to Earth for no good reason.
