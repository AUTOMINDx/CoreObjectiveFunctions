Is it a red flag when your employer says they'll only give you a raise if and when you show them an offer letter from another company?
It's a job their comfortable at, and has the nice benefit of being remote. But for the last 4 years they've had to fight and beg for the couple paltry raises they've seen so far. They were hired starting below average because of "lack of experience" and they now manage people and projects but the pay hasn't scaled to reflect how essential and experienced they are now. Told the employer they would be moving out of state in a few months and quitting, because pay is so much better out there. Company said to show them an offer letter. The move was delayed a couple months, and it was made clear they would not reconsider his compensation until they see an offer letter. Is this scummy or just normal business?
