(UPDATE) My (32f) husband (36m) lied to me this whole time and I don't know what to do
So it's been almost a month since I posted that first post, after reading the comments I really thought about it, and decided I wanted a divorce. Yall were right, I cannot trust this man even if he magically says he wants a kid, already contacted my family lawyer. When I tried to get him to sign the papers, he flat out refused and started begging, and suprise suprise he says he wanted a kid. I gave him an ultimatum that even he wanted children, or even if I decided I didn't want children anymore, I could not trust him ever because chose to betray me. After 2 whole weeks of his bs he finally signed the darn papers. 
Now its still processing, we signed a prenup before marriage so hopefully it won't be too rocky, we are currently separated, I'm living with my twin brother (I don't have anywhere to go rn and I also need emotional support) and looking for houses to rent/buy.
After the divorce I'm planning on just becoming a single mother (even if it's 1 parent it's still a family), I'm tired of men honestly, unless I end up finding someone which I know I won't. I have 2 options rn; artificial insemination or adoption, I'm leaning more towards artificial insemination as adoption is really costly, but that all depends on what will happen after the divorce is finalised and my health as well.
I'll give you guys another edit/update soon!
