Need urgent advice: should I leave my new job of 2 months to go back to old job where offer is till on the table?
So I’ve been finding myself in a bit of a predicament. A few months ago, a recruiter reached out to me for a position that I was under-qualified for at a corporate job. 

When I was approached by the recruiter, I was working at a nonprofit job that I really liked, but was underpaid. Curious about the better paid corporate opportunity, I ended up moving forward with a few interviews and landed the job. When I put in my resignation at the nonprofit organization, they almost matched my corporate salary offer, (only 10k less), but I decided to move forward with the new job opportunity. 

Now, two months into my new job, I am absolutely miserable. I hate the job itself, my onboarding process was terrible, and the organization itself is a disorganized mess. I have approximately 8-9 hours of meetings straight every day, and I’m getting thrown new, confusing projects left and right even though I barely understand the company yet. I told my supervisor that I was feeling quite lost and overwhelmed, and she was not very receptive. She simply apologized but proceeded to invite me to more last minute meetings and throw more projects my way. Now my window of opportunity is closing to go back to my previous employer, and I’m not sure if I should just go back. (The offer is still open for my taking.) I’m looking for advice. Part of me is not sure if I should stay and stick it out, (although the amount of meetings will never change), for the sake of resume building, not disappointing my new team, and avoiding shame &amp; guilt. However, I know I’d be happier at my old job, even if the benefits are not as good. 


Tl;Dr: looking for advice: should I leave my new job of 2 months where I’m miserable to go back to my old job, which paid a little less but made me happier? Or should I stick it out at my new job?
