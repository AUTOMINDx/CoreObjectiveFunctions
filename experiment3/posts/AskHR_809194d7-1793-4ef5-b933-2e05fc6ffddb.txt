[MA] Unpaid, Scheduled On-Call. Do I have a right to refuse or demand pay?
I work at a utility company (in the US) as an engineer and provide approval for field work, particularly in emergencies. For the last few years, me and my team have had a defined “on-call” schedule where we are expected to provide 24/7 coverage in case of emergencies rotating by week. Originally we were told we would be paid a daily stipend for our on-call coverage, which is the practice for all other on-call compensation for the Operations group. I have an email saved with “approval” and a date we would start being paid. The company then pretended there was some HR issue saying we couldn’t be paid because our position was not “Supervisor” but eventually I found out that our VP just had second thoughts and changed his mind about paying us. We still have a defined schedule and are on-call, but just aren’t paid. Does my team have a leg to stand on, legal or otherwise, to basically say “we’re not working on-call anymore if you don’t pay us”? We are non-union if that makes a difference. There is no one else at the company that could provide the support we do and field work is not allowed without an approval form from us.
