The Not-so-obvious Facets of Grandiosity and Entitlement
I made a comment about it yesterday, but I think it deserves its own thread. Dear everybody, I invite you to a discussion about grandiosity and entitlement!

Such psychodynamics do not have to be actions, observable behaviors. They can be observed in covert ways, such as body language. They can manifest in passive aggression as well.

The contempt on your face, when someone is utterly stupid. It goes unsaid that you are utterly smart.

The victorious smirk on your face, when you sadistically win against somebody. It goes unsaid that no lesser being will ever defeat you.

And I believe that grandiosity and entitlement can play out internally, even without any "observable behaviors". And the most curious of psychodynamics and narratives happen in the Narcissist's head when he's doing something that's in his nature: comparing himself to others.

# Grandiosity

When we speak of grandiosity, most people think of somebody being grandiose about their superiority. Money and fame. Intellectual supremacy, moral, hierarchical, sexual, physical and what not. Those are all good grounds on which grandiosity might flourish.

Please stop thinking about grandiosity in terms of Donald Trump. Yeah, he is grandiose, but many narcissists are grandiose elsewhere.

It's not like we don't realize that boasting about our titles or money is generally shallow, vain and socially not so accepted. But fear not, there are many ways to be better than somebody.

For example, I could be boasting about being a victim, being flawed and damaged, to somebody who's my "equal". The hidden message is that "*I had it harder than you, but we ended up in the same place. Therefore, I'm made of better material than you. Even if we both die in misery, my children will be genetically better than yours. In short: I'm better than you*".

Grandiosity can be masked as victimhood. I'm the biggest loser ever, my childhood was a horror, etc. I am sure you have seen contests of who suffers more. I've got it harder than you.

No one could ever relate to my experience. I perceive the world like nobody else does.

It can be masked as uniqueness. I am on this reddit therefore I am among 1% of the population diagnosed with NPD. And we're weird. And Donald Trump is one of us. We're grandiose just by co-association with Trump.

Grandiosity can be masked as being normal. We're the most healthy family, normal, religious etc. The rest of humanity are degenerates. Our neighbors' children do bad things, unlike ours.

Please note that normal means perfect. I am a perfectly balanced person, top 1% most balanced on the planet. And finally, I have a better personality than you, in general.

My narcissistic abuser was more narcissistic than your narcissistic abuser! He wreaked havoc on my psyche! I have trauma, it was the most dangerous monster in the whole bestiary, and I ended up in a relationship with him! You could not possibly imagine the magnitude of pain that I feel. I've even heard that victims of narcissistic abuse become narcissistic themselves! The thought that I almost became a narcissist frightens me! \[Or you were narcissistic in the first place, you idiot\]

# Entitlement

Dictionary definition of entitlement: *the fact of having a right to something.* But I assume most of us are not lawyers, so let's forget "rights" for a moment.

And the popular examples of "why do I have to wait in line?" or how you treat the waiter, imo those are horrible examples. They do not conceptualize the whole of entitlement in the context of pathological narcissism.

Entitlement, imo and in the context of NPD, is basically any "reasoning" that upon closer inspection is ridiculous and unreasonable.

I am severely addicted to weed, but I can't stop because I am suffering from NPD. I am having intense emotions, I need to calm myself down.

I have more reasons to smoke weed than normal people.

But wait, I used to be fine without weed in the past. Maybe I don't need it? But wait... I am going through recovery now! I am a recovering Narcissist, recovery is painful, therefore it is perfectly justifiable for me to smoke weed. It's temporary, for the sake of the greater good, for recovery.

In short, I am addicted to weed because it's perfectly justifiable. It makes sense that I can smoke weed erryday without feeling guilty. Yeah.

I am not religious, but I can imagine: my sins are about as many as yours. But I suffered harder than you. I was a bigger victim. You had one fucked up parent, I had two fucked up parents. It was harder to cope for me. Harder... Oh yeah, I had to work hard. I was tested harder. I worked harder, so I deserve a better place in heaven than you. You might delude yourself or call me mental, but God knows: I am more of a saint than you.

A significant other of mine is aware that I'm narcissistic. And they just told me that I ruin our time together by talking about myself all the time. But they know that I have a personality disorder! I have a special STATUS!

Saying that narcissists talk about themselves too much is like saying that water is wet. They know that I am prone to doing what I just did! How can they point it out, as if they didn't know I'm supersensitive to criticism! How can they do it to me?! How can they be so inconsiderate?

Can't they see that I have a bad day today?

How dare you say that you need some "intimacy", when I am the breadwinner of the family and I have to work hard? You should appreciate and reward me for just doing what I do, I already fill my role in this family!

# They go together perfectly

And by the way, I am the most humble person in this town. I believe that I deserve nothing, because a man should earn everything by himself. Because I'm so ascetic, I am morally superior, and thus you must accept my point of view. You ought to acknowledge me as such. Preferably, you should express admiration as well.

I am always right, because I am entitled to be right. I am right most of the time. I am led to believe that I am more likely to be right than you, therefore I don't even have to process your arguments without instant dismissal. In short, I don't have to take you seriously. That is fortified by the fact that I am much more educated than you. Why would an intelligent person listen to a stupid one?

Look: I was right 4 out of the 4 times we've had a fight. Can't you see, that when dealing with you, I am never wrong? Look at the statistics: 100% win rate. How can you argue with 100% win rate? Are you crazy?

\----------------------

Those are, my dear, the other sides of grandiosity and entitlement. I did my best to illustrate them, I demand your compliments. Less grandiosely, I am expecting your praise. More pro-socially, I wish to hear your opinion about this. More humbly, I hope that you find this insightful, I hope that I can be of any help to you.

More cerebrally, I wish I could discuss this with somebody, with other intellectuals, because I always want to learn. There's no satiation for my hunger for knowledge. I didn't fuck in 7 years btw.
