How common is it to encounter bad therapists?
What are some characteristics of a "bad" therapist and how common are they?

The first 3 therapists I saw were terrible. Only after finding a good one did I know what to avoid and what to look for in a therapist.

Things I've experienced with bad therapists : Half listens, projects their own experiences, double downs on dubious hypotheses, ridicules me for crying, judgmental of my relationships, inappropriate reaction (like laughter when I'm speaking about something serious)

Things I've experienced with good therapists : listens, presents ideas to try, directs the conversation to emotional understanding, doesn't criticize me, points out my own blind spots, detects emotional/facial shifts
