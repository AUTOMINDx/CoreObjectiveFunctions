What in your opinion, do you see as modern day forms of child abuse?
Meaning, modern ways to traumatize and abuse children. Things like putting them on tiktok or YouTube or Facebook for likes. 

New possible forms of munchausen by proxy that are masked in progressive or conservative tolerance? 

Having access to violent porn and torture videos. Just the vast array of examples of humans abusing others in the most extreme ways. 

Training to survive school shootings. 

Less super modern but modern in a human history sense. Is the shrinking of the tribe. Humans need a village to raise a child. That tribe for me growing up was just a mom and her ever changing alcoholic raging men. 

Both parents working and being raised by strangers. 

Etc etc. stuff like that. I could never in good conscience bring a child into this world. For me it’s based on being an atheist. It seems cruel to bring a new consciousness into existence when it will very quickly cease to exist, and there’s nothing they can do about it. 

I suppose our scientific awareness of the non magical non religious reality of the universe is a kind of trauma unto itself. 

Sometimes I wake up in a weird mood and I’m too honest online. So if this post gets to many people attacking me, I might delete it.
