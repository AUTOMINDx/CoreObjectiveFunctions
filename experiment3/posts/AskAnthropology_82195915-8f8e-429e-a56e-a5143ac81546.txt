How did the diversity of ancient Mediterranean/European paganism compare to the diversity of modern Hinduism?
Hi, I asked this question in another subreddit but thought it might be good to ask the question here as well.

I often hear that Hinduism is a very diverse religion and that really it’s a name for a collection of many different but similar religions. Would it be fair to say that is a good way of describing the pagan religions of the pre-Christian era in Europe and the Mediterranean? Like I know that the Romans were good at incorporating other types of paganism into their empire but could that have been explained easily if you view all the different pagan religions as being all the same group like how Hinduism is a collection of many similar religions? I’ve read that some people think that many of the European pagan religions (Roman, Norse, Greek, Slavic, Celtic, Hittite) were all descended from the same proto-indo European religion just as their languages are descended from the same proto-indo European language. Is that true? If it is would it be best to understand them like we do modern Hinduism? Or am I just reading way to much into the idea that there are similarities? I partly ask because I remember reading that early Hinduism was influenced indo Europeans who came in and so that made me think maybe some of the ways we think about modern Hinduism could be applicable to ancient paganism.
