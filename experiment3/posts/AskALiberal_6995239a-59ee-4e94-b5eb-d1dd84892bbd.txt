How do you feel about political dating profiles?
Imagine you're browsing a dating app (even if that's not something you'd do), and you come across a profile, and the profile says:

"She/they. #blacklivesmatter #stopasianhate. Intersectional feminist. Dismantling the patriarchy one day at a time. Trump supporters and unvaxxed swipe left."

Are you more inclined to think "This person shares my values and I want to meet them?"

Or do you consider this behavior off-putting for one reason or another?
