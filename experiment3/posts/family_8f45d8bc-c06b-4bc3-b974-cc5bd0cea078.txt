End of my tether with stepson
My( m40) stepson (23) has turned out a lazy sod,lying in bed all day out all night,no qualifications,no job,and no plans to change this anytime soon.ive had many a debate with his mother about him,she has the wrong mindset and will defend him to the hilt.

Today i was up at 5,had to leave work early because my 5 year old daughter was vomiting and take her to hospital,and ive just climbed into bed now to try and go to work tommorow, daughter still in hospital with her mother taking over,before i left i went into his room and hes lying in bed,12ish in the afternoon,i ask him to take the rubbish out of the kitchen,and do the dishes,i explained to him that lying in bed all day every day isnt good enough,and doing an odd chore should be the least he could do,he agrees with me,i head for the hospital.

I come home at 1130,tired,emotionally drained after the hospital,the fucking kitchen is the same or worse since i left,and hes playing xbox in the room,so i lost my shit at him,but ultimately it seems to serve no purpose.

What am i supposed to do with this guy?
