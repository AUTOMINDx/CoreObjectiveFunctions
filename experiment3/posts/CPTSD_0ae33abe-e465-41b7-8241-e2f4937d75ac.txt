I love you all
I am going through my journey and am often a silent reader here.

I feel seen, i feel myself in your words, i feel like i am finally seen.

I have much love for you all and the journey and the working through whatever shit hand you were dealt

The world doesnt see our struggle or our strengths, glad to be here seeing and being seen

Love
