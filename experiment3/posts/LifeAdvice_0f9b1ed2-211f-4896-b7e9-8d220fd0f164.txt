Confused about my career choice. I'd like some advice.
Basically i've done my college all wrong, too late to go back and fix it, i still have time to make something out of my life though.

I studied IT but learned so little from it that the best i can do is to become someone that can understand how the code works and make a documentation about it.

Now to the real problem. I ended up in telecommunication and i'm not seeing myself being able to cope with the kind of work im being given, its too social, so i'd thought about a career change. Is it a good idea to be a security guard and work my way up the ladder? Or is it better to be a machine operator in a manufacturing company? Should i be part of an animal caretaking facility?

If anything im just looking for a purpose in life where i can actually make a difference.
