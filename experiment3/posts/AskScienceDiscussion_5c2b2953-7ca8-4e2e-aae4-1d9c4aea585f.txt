Why didn't Neanderthals domesticate dogs?
Pat Shipman's *The Invaders* argues that the reason why H. sapiens outcompeted Neanderthals is because the former domesticated dogs, which gave them an edge in hunting. Neanderthals' range overlapped with that of wolves. Are there any reasons we know about as to why they didn't achieve domestication?
