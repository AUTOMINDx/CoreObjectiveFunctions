Did the Goths have a written language that they used?
I'm not very well-versed in the history and spread of writing but this came up in a conversation about the fall of Rome.

I understand that a Gothic alphabet was created, but it seems it was only made in order to translate the Bible and I get the impression that there's not many Gothic documents that aren't either in dispute or just later transcriptions of the spoken language. Would either a Visigoth or an Ostrogoth have had a written language that they could read or write, and if so, what would it have been?
