Just found out my wife is pregnant, what do I do now?
27 years old, married for 8 months. My wife ran out of birth control and we decided not to get more about 40 days ago! Today we found out she’s already pregnant. After seeing 7 pregnancy tests (took seeing that many to believe it was real) I am in shock! I don’t know what to do with my hands. I’m NERVOUS! What am I supposed to do now?

I thought seeing a positive pregnancy test would be one of the best moments of my life, but instead it has me essentially freaking out.
