My kids broke a cup today
They’re 3 and 1 yo. They broke a cup. They were playing while I was cleaning up, and at some point a glass I forgot I left out fell and broke. The three year old wasn’t scared to tell me. I didn’t yell. I just cleaned it up and made sure the kids stayed away from the spot while I used the shop vacuum to clean up all the shards. And while I was cleaning it up I couldn’t help but compare it to my childhood. My kids have no reason to fear me. They don’t even think about hiding an accident like that. I feel so emotional thinking about it. All kids should feel safe and I never did. And I’m so glad my kids have a safer space than I ever did. Just now while sitting typing this I got a hug, “I love you”, and cuddles from the three year old for no reason other than they wanted it.

Edit: I see so many people saying I’m an amazing parent and I think the important thing to acknowledge here is that every single child deserves this kind of home. This isn’t special it’s the basics of good parenting. And we all deserved to feel safe growing up. All’s we can do now is to make sure we do our best to not repeat those abuses we had on the younger generations whether our own kids or not.
