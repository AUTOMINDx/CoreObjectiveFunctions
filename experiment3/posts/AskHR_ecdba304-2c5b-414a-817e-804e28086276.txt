[CA] Sleeping with coworker
I started in an entry level position at my company about 10 years ago and became friends with another employee who was hired at the same time (and same position).  We were plutonic friends for about 8 years, but about a year ago, we started sleeping together. It’s a great arrangement and we’re both happy with it. 

Since we were hired, we have both worked our way up, and we both manage separate branches in our company.  BUT I have recently been offered a position that will make me his boss… basically managing several branches, including his. (We will not work together in the same physical location)

I’m in a panic. NOBODY knows that we have a physical relationship, as we are both VERY private introverts and we’ve always wanted to keep our private lives private. 

I haven’t signed the offer letter yet, and I don’t know what to do. Is this is the sort of thing I *need* to disclose? Do I need to get his consent if I disclose it?? Are there any legal implications if I do/don’t disclose it?
