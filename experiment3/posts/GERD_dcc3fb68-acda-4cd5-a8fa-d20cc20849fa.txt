PPI failed. Terrified that surgery is next step
[36F] I have LPR (symptoms are shortness of breath and globus) and have not improved with medication (40mg pantoprazole twice a day for 8 weeks). Iâ€™m so scared that on my next appointment my GI will say only thing left is surgery. Has anyone been in a similar situation and improved without having to go the surgery route? I was planning to get pregnant next year and am in despair over the thought of having to get reflux surgery instead.
