Any thoughts on “The Dawn of Everything”
[I saw this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/arts/dawn-of-everything-graeber-wengrow.html?mc=aud_dev&amp;campaign_id=23849700074580063&amp;ad-keywords=auddevgate&amp;subid1=TAFI&amp;adset_id=23849708886830063&amp;ad_id=23849708887250063&amp;fbclid=IwAR1pD6jgLQ296EbXgK-6sqmXxhABu-Di7d0aCSMqw5--c0OzjCpN9E9qO5E&amp;ad_name=INTER_20_XXXX_XXX_1P_CD_XX_XX_SITEVISITXREM_X_XXXX_COALL_P_X_X_EN_FBIG_OA_XXXX_00_EN_JP_NFLINKS&amp;adset_name=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2021%2F10%2F31%2Farts%2Fdawn-of-everything-graeber-wengrow.html). In general I tend to be very wary of any anthropological headlines in mainstream journalism, particularly anything claiming to upend consensus.  
  
But the article does seem to suggest it's evidence-based, well-sourced and at least pointed in the right direction. I was wondering if anybody here had read it and had some thoughts, or heard feedback from somebody in the field?  
  
Thanks in advance for any helpful replies!
