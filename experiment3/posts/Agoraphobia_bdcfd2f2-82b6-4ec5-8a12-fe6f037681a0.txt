Agoraphobia
I'm 25 female.. no idea how to kickstart my finances .. I been without a job for 2 years. Because of this giving me ptsd I am going to have to start a small part time job first..... I'm panicking that I dont have money saved.. and no idea when I will b able to apply for a job. I worry because at some point I have to move out and I dont have a boyfriend to b able to do that
