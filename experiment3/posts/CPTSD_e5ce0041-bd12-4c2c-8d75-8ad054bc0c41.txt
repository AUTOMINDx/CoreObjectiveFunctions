DAE get violently critical of themselves after sharing something?
Sharing hobbies, stories, and even jokes literally drives me insane. I nitpick everything I could have possibly said or done better. It’s unbearable and I love sharing but the emotions afterwards get so intense it feels like I’ll die. I always wish I could go back in time to stop it.
