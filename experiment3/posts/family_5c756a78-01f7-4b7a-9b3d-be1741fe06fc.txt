Step-dad who's younger than me??
My mother (50) F, has married a man (23) M, and I don't know how to feel about it. I am happy that she's moved on from the divorce (with my dad) they had a very toxic relationship. I don't know how to feel about her bringing her new husband into our home. We've been working hard all our lives and we're forced to grow up, pay the rent, and contribute financially. At this very moment, my elder sibling (27) F and I (24) F have been running the business while our parents have been away.
We've been left to raise our younger sister and pay all the bills including personal debts of our parents. My mother now wants to bring her new husband into our lives. To live in our home, the home we (sibling) and I struggling to pay for. Feels like a slap in the face, since this new husband doesn't even have a job. We will essentially be looking after him. I'm trying to be supportive and happy for her but I don't know how much more I can take. Am I being unreasonable?
