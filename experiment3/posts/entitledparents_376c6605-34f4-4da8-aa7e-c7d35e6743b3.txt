Entitled Dad Angry at my underwear
Well damn, two days since my last post in this sub and I already have another thing to post, this time about my stepfather.

As a background, I'm a transman, someone who was assigned female at birth but identifies on the masculine end of the societal gender binary. My siblings and mom are pretty ok with it, even if it took some time for them to adjust. My stepdad, however, is not as cool. He still calls me by my deadname and uses feminine pronouns, tells my siblings to stop calling me "brother" and go back to using "sister", etc. 

Yesterday was Christmas and in my stocking was four pairs of boxers (the underwear). They were Star Wars themed and are so comfortable. And it's pretty validating that "Santa" (my mom) got me dudewear.

My stepdad didn't say anything when I opened the gifts, so I hoped it was at least him going with something, even if he didn't/doesn't think I'm valid. Oh, how naive of me.

While my mom had us doing laundry again (family of 13, we have a lot of laundry), I overheard my parents arguing about the underwear. Overheard is kind of inaccurate, though, because they are both loud motherfuckers. He was going on about "appropriate for a girl, HE'S A GIRL!" Yes, he did say "he's a girl", lol. My mom said that since he didn't pay for gifts thus year, it wasn't up to him. I wasn't about to interrupt, that guy scares the shit out of me. Towards the end, he said that it would've been more "decent" to get me lingerie. My mom seemed quiet for a bit, then said "Son or daughter, do you really think it's appropriate to get our kid lingerie?"

I think my dad was mumbling something at that point because I couldn't hear him, but he doesn't usually give up arguments that easily.
