Feel depressed getting a bachelors in psychology
I went into uni with a clear path of becoming a counselling psychologist, well now I’m going to graduate in April and I feel like grad school is just not feasible for me anymore. It’s going to cost 27 grand and I already am in like 18k debt from my undergrad. I’m 25F and I want to be able to have a house, get married and have a family and all of those things cost money. I feel really depressed about the job prospects I have with a BA in psychology and now I’m thinking I should have picked something else but nothing else interests me. It’s hard to see other people in my life like becoming lawyers, buying houses and starting families. The way that I feel is not healthy and I don’t know what to do.
