Anyone have experience on rejecting an offer after you’ve already accepted?
So I’ve been offered a role in a great company, however I’m not too sure if the role is a right fit for me.They gave me the weekend to sit on it and I’m still undecided. If I accept I may continue applying for roles before my start date (mid Jan) but wondering how common is it to accept another offer when you’ve already signed to another company?
