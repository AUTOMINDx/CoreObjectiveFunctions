Do you think equal rights based on gender should be guaranteed by the US constitution?
The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is an unratified amendment to the US Constitution. It was proposed on March 22, 1972, but has never managed to gain enough support to be ratified by the three-quarters of states required for the amendment to make it into the constitution. The text of the ERA is rather simple.

&gt;Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.  
&gt;  
&gt;Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.  
&gt;  
&gt;Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.

Do you think this should be added to the constitution? Do you think it's redundant given the Civil Rights Act and Equal Pay Act? What are your reasons?

Apologies in advance for the US centric question
