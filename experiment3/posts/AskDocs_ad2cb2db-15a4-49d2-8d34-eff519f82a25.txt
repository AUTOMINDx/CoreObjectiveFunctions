I have nearly all COVID symptoms but 3 negative tests. Normally wouldn't worry about it but complete and total lack of smell and taste in conjunction with other symptoms. Can you continue to test negative even if positive?
43 y/o male - vaccinated against covid and totally healthy otherwise.

Symptoms started 8 days ago (11/27) and included

* Sore throat
* Cough
* Sneezing
* Tons of congestion
* Headache (but no fever)
* Body aches

The 4th day after those symptoms,  I 100% lost all sense of taste and smell and they are still gone.  

I tested three times in the last week (PCR on 11/28, Rapid antigen on 12/1, and PCR yesterday) - all negative.

I wouldn't worry about it except the loss of taste/smell is profound.  Way worse than anything I've ever had from a cold or flu before.   Is it possible to have COVID yet not have it pop on any of these tests?
