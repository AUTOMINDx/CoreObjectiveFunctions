Is anyone’s mental health worse at this time of year?
I like Christmas, but I think the expectation of ‘having’ to enjoy myself puts unnecessary pressure on me, if that makes sense?

Edit: Wow, this sure blew up! It’s reassuring to know so many people feel like me. Whatever you’re doing this year, I hope you have a Merry Christmas :)
