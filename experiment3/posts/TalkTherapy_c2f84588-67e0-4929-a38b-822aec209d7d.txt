The moment you feel ready to start cutting down sessions ðŸ¤©
Today was the day T and  I decided to go from 2x/ week to 1x/week. Honestly when we started twice a week I couldnâ€™t even begin to imagine this day. Pretty happy and excited with the amount of progress made this year! :) T couldnâ€™t stop cheesin while we were going over all my successes and achievements.
