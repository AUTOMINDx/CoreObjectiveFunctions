Best of 2021 contest - call for nominations
Hi!

For many of us, this community and our community project mean a lot. Many of us spend hours upon hours here, making sure to turn [r/askphilosophy](https://new.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/) into an amazing resource for people having questions about academic philosophy. Our standards make us unique, and our welcoming new members give us a soul. Your participation makes [r/askphilosophy](https://new.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/) what it is and it is time to recognize your hard work. \*Especially\* in a weird year like 2021.

Reddit is [kindly gifting us enough coins for 20 coveted "Owl of Minverva" awards.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2021/comments/rip7qa/its_time_to_kick_off_the_best_of_awards_for_2021/) The recipients will get a neat award and one month free Reddit premium plus 700 coins. 

Now it is time to nominate. nominations will stay open for about 10 days, at which point you will be kindly invited to vote on the nominations. Categories are:

* Best answer
* Best question
* Outstanding user

The five or so top-voted nominations in each category will gain the award. Additionally, the mods will choose five or so overlooked comments, posts and users at our discretion. 

**How to nominate**

Below, you'll find three comments for the three categories. To nominate, reply to them with a link to the nominated content and please tag the username (by writing [/u/xyz](https://new.reddit.com/u/xyz/)).

If there is an exceptional case where you request to stay anonymous, please shoot me a chat message. I will not accept nominations by normal personal message because I cannot guarantee I will not lose those.

**Who can be nominated**

Any user in good standing except me. I am running this contest on behalf of the mod team, so I will stay out of competition. Anyone else is fair game, except users who are banned at any time while this contest is running. But chances are if you wish to nominate someone for outstanding work on this sub, they aren't banned.

**Thank you for your nominations**

[Last year's awards](https://new.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l6zd6n/best_of_2020_final_results_and_celebration_thread/) were lots of fun and highly appreciated, and we are sure this year's edition will be, too :)
