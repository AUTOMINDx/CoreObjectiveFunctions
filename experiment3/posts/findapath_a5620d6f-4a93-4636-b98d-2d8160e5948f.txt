I don’t enjoy anything - 29m
I feel like I’ve been faking everything my whole life.

I have no real friends, thanks to the pandemic I’ve been stuck in a country for 2 years without being able to leave.

My family is toxic and part of the reason I moved away.

I hate my job and am so unsatisfied by it, and feel like I wasted 4 years at university and 6 years working. 

I’m so lonely and have spent most of the past 6 months alone in my apartment.

I don’t know what to do or what I even want to do. I feel like I’m wasting my life and am so unhappy. 

How do I fix myself?
