Am I morally responsible if someone commits suicide because of my action or inaction?
If someone tells me they're gonna commit suicide if I do something that's inconsequential to their decision and I still do it, does that make me morally responsible for their death? I didn't have a hand in their decision but they did warn me that there will be a consequence to my action.

This is all hypothetical.
