How long does it take on average to recover from post-COVID19?
Hello everybody!

I’m writing from my hubby’s account. Hopefully, you don’t mind that. The thing is that my hubby got tested positive for COVID19 despite all our preventative measures. It took him a while to recover completely, and I was terrified that someone else would get sick too.

But there are two questions I would like to ask in this group. My husband is 42 y.o. Before he got COVID19, he used to go jogging every morning. Also, he took our dog for a walk every evening. Besides, we both used to go to the gym. He was always full of energy and motivated me to work out, even when I came exhausted from work. Now, he always complains about his pain in joints, muscles and he says that sometimes that it’s even painful for him to lie down on the couch. So, the first question is how long it will take him to recover? I know that everything is pretty much individual. Still, some stats should be based on the recovery process for each age group and different subgroups. Surprisingly, our doctor doesn’t say much about it. It’s so heartbreaking to watch him suffer from pain, and even painkillers and some home remedies don’t help much.

Secondly, I would like to ask about protective accessories. The first this that, weirdly, my husband got covid. We are both vaccinated. Besides, we always wear our face masks and use hand sanitizers. Even when we are outdoors. When we come back home, the first thing we do is wash our hands, and only then do we remove our masks and through them away. I bought the whole pack of protective face masks and replaced them every hour. Besides, the used ones we just throw away. But recently, I came across that those masks are not really efficient. Also, I found a website with different medical [protective accessories](https://harmonycr.com/). Still, is there any difference between the store that sold face masks and the site I found online?

I hope someone here can clarify everything for me. Perhaps, there is something I don’t know.
