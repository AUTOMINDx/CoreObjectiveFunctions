Is it unethical to post pictures on social media that show a stylised version of your life? Where is the line? What does the answer depend on?
I find myself going back and forth between believing in the freedom of self expression and wanting to accommodate society’s problem with people losing confidence, comparing themselves to influencers, anxiety and depression from social media etc. 

I’m somewhat landed on an internal conclusion that as long as your posts are not deceiving (using photoshop, posting travel pics from one short trip all year around, lying about how you achieved your body/money/other features) you are okay to post what you post and you are not required to post also all the realistic perhaps not as good sides in your life (when bad things happen, you get sick or your body is not good) - although that would get some authencity points. 
There are still some grey areas for me about what is deceiving and what is not though.

I think people who deal with issues when using social media also have to take some responsibility for their own mental health. Meaning, I don’t think influencers have to limit how much they post their lives to help people with their insecurities. After all, people don’t have to follow them. 

I don’t think the answer to the insecurity is to shield people from these “perfect” lives, but to educate people about what the difference between reality and social media is. This doesn’t mean concluding that all influencers are unhappy, narcissists or layers though. 

This is just my view that I’m still quite uncertain about. 

I’m curious to hear your views to help me reflect on my navigation in social media.
