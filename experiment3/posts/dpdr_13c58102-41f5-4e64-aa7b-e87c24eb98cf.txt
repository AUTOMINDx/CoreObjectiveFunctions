“Did that wake you up? Are you back now?”
I depersonalised so badly the other day from an argument he and I had, I’ve been trying to come back this whole time, only just now being able to start signing again (I started figuring out how to gain back mobility in my fingers enough to communicate when I’m really bad, since  verbal words are nowhere near possible). 

A TV show was on today, though I wasn’t paying much attention. He cracked a joke about it, which made me sort of laugh. He then condescendingly reacted with the above quote, and I fell even deeper into the nothingness than I already was. 

Why is it people think it’s funny to crack jokes about this? Why do people get to “act tired” of me being like this like it’s a choice, when it’s literally their fault that I’m in it so deeply and can’t get out? 

Sorry, just needed somewhere safe to say this.
