Anyone else just miserable during Venus' retrograde??
I'm finally in a relationship where I'm actually wanted, but I keep getting extremely depressed over the last relationship I was in previously, despite my happiness now??? I don't really quite get it. I've been past it for a while, but it's been eating me alive since the retrograde started. A lot of negative feelings have been popping up, which is odd, considering we ended on good terms. Maybe this is bringing about old wounds that maybe I haven't quite closed yet?

EDIT: I decided to, in a peaceful way, cut ties with the old flame. We were trying to stay friends, but it wasn't working. I feel like there's nothing more for me by trying to keep a friendship that's just awkward and painful. I think this retrograde was trying to tell me to let go of old trauma, so I did. We'll see what they say.
