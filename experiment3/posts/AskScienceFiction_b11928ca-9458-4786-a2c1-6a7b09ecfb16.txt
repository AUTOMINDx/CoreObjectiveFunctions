[The Witcher] Why do Geralt and other Witchers bother carrying two swords: one steel sword (for humans and beasts) and one silver sword (for monsters), when one silver sword would surely be okay?
If the aim of slaying humans and beasts with a sword is to maim them, why would using the same silver sword not suffice? It's still damaging physically, and you can still apply oils and poisons as you wish. I see no point if the steel sword existing if you already have a sword that's able to kill monsters more effectively

TLDR: Silver swords would still fuck up humans, so why bother lugging around a steel sword?

Edit: it's been answered, thanks!
