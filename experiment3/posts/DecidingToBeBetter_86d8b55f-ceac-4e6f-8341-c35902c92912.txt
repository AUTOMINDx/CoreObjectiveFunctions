Day 7 no contact/ post break up
Getting up for work I’m still checking my phone more than I need to but ya know. I don’t have any socials so haven’t been checking his page or anything. Realizing I’m gonna be fine without him. I just have to feel my feelings and then set them free.
I’m so proud for staying strong.
