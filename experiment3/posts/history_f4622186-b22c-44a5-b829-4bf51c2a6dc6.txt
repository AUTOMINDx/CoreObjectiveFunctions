When did all of Russia learn about the deaths of ALL the Romanovs? (Aka Russia’s last monarchy)
When Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered in 1918, how long did it take for the rest of Russia to find out about their deaths? I understand the Tsar’s death was widely reported (I’m not sure how long after that was) and they didn’t report the deaths of the children. The big question is when did they found out about the children's fates. How long did the Russian government try to keep it a secret that they didn’t kill the children and what was the public reaction?
