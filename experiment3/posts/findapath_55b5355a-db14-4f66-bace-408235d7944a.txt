Almost 24 and I haven't a clue how to get a grip on my life. Someone, please help me.
ADHD &amp; Anxiety, and Depression have ruined me. I have no plans for myself because I'm too anxious to go outside; and on top of that, my ADHD makes everything seem so boring (unless I'm really into whatever I am doing).

I've tried a TON to go out and get work before the virus, but I'm so incredibly burnt out from the process of finding a job. That, now, I just sit at home, sometimes doing online freelance work and making some money to support the things I want. Other than that, I don't have any real idea on what the fuck I want to do. Or, have any desire to try finding a job anymore due to either being rejected so many times, or just feeling burnt out to the whole "job hunting" bullshit.

I have zero patience for college, I know my ADHD will make it nearly impossible to concentrate in college. I have thought about doing a trade, but I know how time demanding those types of jobs can be, and I really value work/life balance.

I want to go to therapy really badly, but I don't want to burn through my savings since I don't have any health insurance. Please, someone here must understand how I feel. I don't know what to do with myself anymore...
