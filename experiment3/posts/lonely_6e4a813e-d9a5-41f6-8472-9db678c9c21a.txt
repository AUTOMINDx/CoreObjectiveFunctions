My dog is going to get euthanized tonight
He's been the best boy for 14 years.
This year I've lost many loved souls and it's been a shitshow generally.
I'll be okay I guess but i'm  feeling so devastated right now, so sad and lonely, I'm just crying and can barely move. Took me half an hour to write this lol.
Just needed to get this out, thanks to anyone who read it
