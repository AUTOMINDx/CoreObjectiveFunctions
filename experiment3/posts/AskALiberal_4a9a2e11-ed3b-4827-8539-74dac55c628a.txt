Why is Democratic messaging so poor in comparison to the GOP?
The GOP, while I vehemently disagree with their platform, are incredible at messaging and controlling the narrative. Obamacare, Fake News, Let’s Go Brandon, etc. are all simple but powerful enough messages that get through to even the dumbest voter.

Democrats on the other hand seem to fall over themselves and need hour long video essays to explain their positions on things. If you’re explaining, you’re losing. I hate to draw this comparison, but it’s very similar to what we’re seeing out of the CDC right now where they truly mean well but their public speaking skills leave a lot to be desired. 

I fully recognize Dems are at a disadvantage being a big tent party, but given that it’s causing direct harm to their campaigns, I have to ask the question - why not just start poaching GOP operatives to help your side since it’s clear they don’t know how to connect with low information voters?

I am sure a lot of you will say we shouldn’t stoop to slogans and zingers to win politically but I strongly feel it’s necessary in today’s ADHD partisan climate.
