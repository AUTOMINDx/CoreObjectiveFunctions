Just my curiosity, do generals throughout history feel guilty when their bad decision make many soldiers got killed in battle?
I once read an article, it says the mindset of some generals are approximate to those of the serial killers.

Just like serial killers, generals lack the ability to feel guilty on their wrong behavior and cannot  sympathize with others.

Like Napoleon in Russia, did he feel guilty that his bad decision made his Grande Armee decimated?

Did Montgomery feel guilty when Operation Market Garden was a failure and got many Allied soldiers killed?

Or do the generals think casualty is the nature of war, so people can't blame me for such thing.

Is there any written material that shows the guilt of a general after a lost battle?
