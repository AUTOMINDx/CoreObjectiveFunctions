People who left a relaxed low-stress job to pursue a career, did you regret it?
Right now I'm in a situation where I'm working from home. The hours I do work including meetings are typically around 2-3 hours per day. But the work isn't that challenging and I'm not growing too much from it. I have an 83k per year salary in a HCOL city, but there's not really upward mobility.

Lately I've just been filling the time just going to the gym 6 days a week. I've been researching critically acclaimed albums, films and books and just listen, watch, read them to try to become a more well-rounded person. I've been spending more time with friends, family and learning how to cook.

&amp;#x200B;

However despite doing all this, I still feel like I'm missing something, or that I'm not achieving what I could achieve. Which has made me contemplate leaving my job for a career that has potential to earn 2-3x more than what I'm making and that I can continually improve in.

I actually have landed offers for mid size tech company for software engineering. (My current role is IT related but not software development).

Which is why I'm asking if anyone else was in a similar situation, where they left a relaxing low-stress job with decent pay in pursuit of a career / more meaningful work. And if so, did you end up regretting it or did it add to your life?
