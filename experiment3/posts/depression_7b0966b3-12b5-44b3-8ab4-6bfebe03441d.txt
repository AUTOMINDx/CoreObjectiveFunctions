Life is just so fucking sad
Literally everything. The way people interact when they don’t understand each other, which is most people. The way relationships are destined to fail long term, I genuinely don’t believe it’s possible to not get cheated on, even if it takes 40 years from that person, they’ll always get bored. Or people just fall out of love. All that matters to the world seems to be sex and looking your best. I genuinely can’t think of something more heart breaking than being alive. I hate the way peoples brains work, including my own. I hate how selfish everyone is, and how unwilling people are to realize how their actions, even if seemingly small, can harm others. I hate that I have to work, I hate that I have things expected of me, I hate that I have people that care about me because I just want to be left alone yet I hate being alone. I hate that people are so fucking scary, even if they’re not murderers. You really cannot trust anyone, because if the opportunity arises they’ll hurt you for their own benefit. I hate that emotional abuse and things like that aren’t taken seriously. I hate how I feel EVERYTHING yet so fucking empty all the time. I hate how one little thing can change the way you think forever. I hate that so much of my self worth relies on others. I hate that it looks like I’m just a lazy piece of shit. I hate that I’m supposed to adapt to how shitty and unfair life is, I don’t fucking want to. I hate that I want nothing more than to be dead but I can’t kill myself. Life is a sick joke. Just let me die  
TLTR: I hate, and the instinctual will to live is a fuckin bitch
