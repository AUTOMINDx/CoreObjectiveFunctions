If q-tips arenâ€™t supposed to go into your ear, how are you expected to clean your ear wax?
My ear is extremely clogged, Iâ€™ve tried water, but that clogged my ear even more. Well?

Edit: Thanks for the upvotes and awards, I didnâ€™t really need them nor expect them however. The only award I really liked on here was the ðŸ”’ award. Good stuff

Edit 2: People, please. Can you stop upvoting and giving rewards? I donâ€™t need them. I have almost 50k karma and Iâ€™m not looking for any more, and especially not because of a post on ear wax. I asked the mods to lock it, and I didnâ€™t delete the post so that others can benefit from it when they might need it. Also, please stop messaging me. Youâ€™re basically circumventing the reason why I asked the mods to lock the post.
