In the recent 2020 PhilPapers Survey, most responders said they accept or lean towards omnivorism (48%) rather than vegetarianism (26%) or veganism (18%) when asked whether is it permissible to eat animals and/or animal products in ordinary circumstances. Why is this so?

I'm not well informed about the current discussions on the ethics of eating animal and/or animal products. But I have seen a lot of posts and comments in this subreddit talking about the fact that most philosophers support veganism, so I'm confused. Did it change over time or am I interpreting this survey in a wrong way?
