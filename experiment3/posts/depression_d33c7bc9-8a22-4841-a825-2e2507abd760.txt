My friend killed herself today
I really hope heaven is all its cracked up to be. She had an abusive father, bulimia, and I was one of the few people that actually gave a fuck about her. Now she's gone and im alone. One day you can deal with pain and then you wake up and you just can't do it anymore. She's been through hell she deserves heaven. Im an atheist but I just need to believe in a God right now.
