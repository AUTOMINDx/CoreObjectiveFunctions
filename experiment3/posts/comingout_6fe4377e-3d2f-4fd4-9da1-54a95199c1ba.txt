I came out to my best friend of 13 years (UPDATE)
So, I had made a post on this sub about how I have been thinking of coming out to my BFF who I have known for 13 years which is basically my whole life.

I was really nervous and scared, yesterday morning I told her that there was something I wanted to tell her and thought I would do it over text but then I thought it would be better if I did it face to face. So, we decided to meet 10 min earlier than our coaching classes.

She had sent me a post saying - I hope my bestfriend finds a guy who loves her, as much as I love her.

We met and I said - you know how you sent me that post.... well, I want to tell you that I don't want a guy. I want a girl. 

She looked kinda shocked and I said I am sure that I like girls but I don't know how I feel about guys...

She told me that she was really happy and glad that I told her. 

I knew that she would not react badly but I didn't think that she would just accept me.... idk

But she did say that I should tell my mom soon like by the end of the year, but I already have my plans that I will tell her once I am over 18 and I move out.

Ya but all In all it was amazing I felt so much more relaxed and now I can finally talk like freely to her ig.

Sorry this is a very long story, but my advice to anyone who is thinking of coming out please know that you should do it when you feel ready and comfortable but it will let you be free.
