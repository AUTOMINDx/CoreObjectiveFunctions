I Just Learned Why My Dad VEHEMENTLY Defends Pedophiles
Trigger Warning 
For years, we've gotten screaming fights about awful celebrities. Like Woody Allen for instance. CBS Sunday Morning did a piece on Penelope Cruz and touched on her very special relationship with that incestuous sexual monster. The fight picked right back where it ended last time, and he FINALLY told me why he always sides with the rapists who prefer younger flesh. He told me when he was a younger man, in his mid to late 20s, he had several 'girlfriends' he'd pick from his niece's school. His niece was in middle to high school. I'm still processing it, because he gloated about it. Like it was something to be PROUD of. 
This. From the guy who threatened to murder me when he found out I had been groomed at 14 by a 19 year old from the alternative school wing of my high school. This from the guy who called me and my sister slurs if we wore spaghetti straps and shorts above the knee in the middle of summer. I think I'm gonna be sick.
