Is this the end of JIT manufacturing?
Does the pandemic, showed us that this is the end of JIT manufacturing as it is known now? Or is this just a phase that we will overcome with some twitch to the basic form of JIT? 

Personally, I think that we will have to put JIT manufacturing in a drawer and keep it there for the next few years. This pandemic showed us that we can not only rely solely on JIT without bigger inventories.

I'd like to hear about other points of view.
