It hurts to be alive
The mental pain that I experience everyday has translated into agonizing physical pain as well. I feel a giant pit in my stomach at all times, I can barely eat, I have no energy, and I don’t want to get out of bed.

Nothing ever gets better for me. It’s an endless cycle of pain. Just as soon as I think I’m getting better and making progress, I’m hit with another curveball and I’m left with nothing.

I wish this misery would end.
