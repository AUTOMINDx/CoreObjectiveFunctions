I did it!
I started off with a mantra:  

I can do this. I believe in me. We are going somewhere fun to find cool things for my Joker cosplays. It will be okay. Nothing bad is going to happen. My husband will be with me. Remember to breathe. Leaving the house is okay. Nothing bad will happen. Sunglasses so I can '*Big Daddy'* this thing, and I'm going to feel safe and secure. I am safe. We will be okay. I will bring my headphones and phone if I need to drown out the outside world.

After:  
I went to three stores and left the house for a full hour! I have a bit of a headache, and I'm tired, but I did it! SUCCESS! Thank you to whomever suggested the Finch app in a previous post, it really helped me aim to focus on my breathing and not be as terrified!
