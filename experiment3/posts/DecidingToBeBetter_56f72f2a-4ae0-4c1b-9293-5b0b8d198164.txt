I'm 24 and I hate being male. I don't want to go down the path of being a transgender woman or a non-binary person. I hate how the male gender is viewed.
I can't blend in with other guys... especially at work. Its like the way they act and talk is so hard to relate to (and I'm a guy). Sometimes they sound like a broken record... sports, sex, drinking, lots of teasing, gym, drugs, videogames, using the same slang and tone. I know that's the way most men bond with each other. But damn, it feels fake, it's like they put a lot of effort trying to make every conversation  "accidental"... they don't want to show too much interest or emotion. They have to filter out a lot of thoughts and behavioral patterns before reacting to a certain thing... because spontaneous reactions are considered "weak" and "unmanly"... hence they put an effort on trying not to freak out when they get scared or surprised... idk... I feel  very distant when it comes to other men, and I don't even know how to approach them without pretending to be someone I'm not... I'm not trying to say this in a bitter kind of way because I know my father's abandonment and being raised by a single mom surrounded by sisters in a very catholic environment had a lot to do with my lack of connection with most men. I feel broken tho and I really don't know what to do.  I feel like trapped sometimes in this body... limited by social standards.. I don't feel manly enough and I don't even want to be that anyway... but I feel like I have an identity crisis and tbh I don't relate to non-binary/trans stuff either. I don't want to be ambiguous. I hate it too. I wish I could relate to society's views... it would be more simple to accept myself and feel validated.
