My friend is so supportive 🥺
So I told her I was questioning my gender and thinking about the label “demigirl”. And she was so nice, she said she could use whatever pronouns or name I wanted. And she even said she wouldn’t mention it in our group chat (some of our friends have different ideas about this stuff). Ugh I’m so happy and I almost started crying in my English class.
