Any of you have physical symptoms that just don’t go away?
The constant chest pounding. I feel my heart beat allllll damn day every day. It’s been like, months? All my heart tests are clear. Also, the 24.7 background feeling of dread/death. 

Anyone else have permanent symptoms that aren’t cyclical like panic attacks?
