Having an anxiety-fueled day, which sucks. Throat symptoms.
I feel like my gag reflex is more sensitive now. The left side of my throat feels numb at times, swollen at times, painful at times, sore and scratchy etc. There’s so much post nasal drip I’m clearing from my throat it’s unreal. Trouble swallowing at the throat level. It just sucks. Anyone else have similar issues?
