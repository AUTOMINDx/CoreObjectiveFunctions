Gap year after finishing undergrad. Will this have a negative impact?
I am in my 4th year and will be graduating next June.

I was wondering if taking a gap year will be a good thing. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety so I was planning on going for therapy plus I have some medical issues that I need to take care of( mostly will include surgeries). Uni and internships have been a major stress for me. Also, I am kind of lost about what to do in life since I am not very interested in the major that I am doing. Hence the gap year.

Will this have a negative impact on job search or grad school admission in future?
