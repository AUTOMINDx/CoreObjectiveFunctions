Therapist is an MLM Hun
Just found out that my therapist is a Beachbody hun. I am in therapy for eating disorder recovery (mostly orthorexia) and in an effort to stop tracking calories in MyFitnessPal, she wants me to start using the Beachbody color coded portion containers. Is this bad or alarming? She promises me it will help.

Edit: She also claims I do not have an eating disorder, I have OCPD that “manifests itself in food restrictions and clean eating.” Meanwhile my ED was what I went for help for in the first place.
