I wish people understood how unlikeable mental illness makes you
I have major depressive and a few other diagnoses, and while I'm very responsible for my actions and mistakes I also have no doubt that my illnesses have contributed greatly to the insane number of friends I've lost over the last few years. I feel like a lot of mental health awareness takes for granted that signs are recognizable in a palatable way, and leaves out how often the signs manifest in things that are uncomfortable, annoying, and unlikable

People don't like people who are unresponsive, don't message first or make plans much, and have inconsistent texting patterns

People don't like people who are tired all the time and stay inside alone all day, or who go through mood swings (even if not sudden) such that you can't tell how they're feeling

People don't like people who are suicidal, and act hedonistically to try to distract from the pain

People don't like people who require undue emotional labor, or who push away loved ones because they feel like a burden

People don't like people who have to spend so much time working on themselves that it's difficult for them to meaningfully engage with others

People don't like people who are insecure and need assurance, or who act out in an effort to be likable only to feel like they've completely embarrassed themselves

I'm not even saying people are wrong for any of this. I know I don't have a right to be "liked." But Jesus christ I know there is a likeable person inside me, and I see flashes of them sometimes, but I really feel like I've lost them.
