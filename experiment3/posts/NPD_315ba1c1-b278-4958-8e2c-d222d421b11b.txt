Can’t stop reading about narcissism
Anyone else like this since they became self aware? 
I think it’s making my depression worse but I can’t stop reading about it as I feel like I need to understand it all. It’s blown my mind. 
The main thing is I want to be able to build my own self esteem without needing outside validation. I don’t wanna live needing others approval to feel ok. That’s shit.
