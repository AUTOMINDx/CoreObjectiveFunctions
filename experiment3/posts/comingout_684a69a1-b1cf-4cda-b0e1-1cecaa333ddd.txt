Necessitating “Coming Out”
I’ve never come out I feel no real need to, in fact, the whole “coming out” thing is pretty cringe to me. I’m a fairly private person I struggle to let people know about any interests I have; even if it’s as mundane as being a fan of a specific wizarding book series or Pokémon you only know when I destroy you at trivia. I don’t even obnoxiously correct people when I know they’re wrong about an interest I may have. Have times changed is it still as important? Straight people don’t need to “come out” also I’m 30 and feel it’s past my time for all that.
