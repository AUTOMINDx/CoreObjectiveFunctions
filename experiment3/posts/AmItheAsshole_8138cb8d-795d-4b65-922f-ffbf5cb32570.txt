AITA for not wanting to make my friend a wedding dress for cost of materials?
So I have a Degree in Fashion which some people think means I can be their personal seamstress, i'm used to this problem and I don't mind helping people out but I never work for free.

My pregnant friend recently reached out to me and asked me if I could make her, her wedding dress and sent me pictures of the idea she had in mind, it isn't exactly a *simple* dress but also not the most complex i've ever done either, I told her I could for sure do that for her and it'd cost Â£600, she was shocked at this and told me she thought i'd do it for free and she'd just pay for materials, I pointed out how many hours this would take me to do and all the hand embroidery needed, then I explained I was doing this for a quarter of the price i'd charge other people because she's my friend.

At this point she started to get very upset telling me I have no idea how much stress she's under with the wedding and the fact she's pregnant and how money is tight and how this should be my wedding gift to her and how great it'd look in my portfolio, I don't think i'm being unreasonable to want *some* money for this...but other friends are telling me it's horrible how i'm wanting to charge her for this and it's not like i'm a high end bridal shop...am I being unreasonable?
