Can I recover from this or did I screw myself?
Short version of events is that I was terminated this past week from my internship. I can make all the excuses I want but the end all be all is that while working remotely, I got no work done at home over the past month. This was a part time internship, and the only relevant work experience that I had up until this point. I will be graduating in the spring with my bachelors.

My question is, can I recover from this position? I can't imagine how this will look on a resume or the effect this will have on my future. Any advice is welcome really.
