Entitled MIL throws party for deceased on my birthday
My MIL loves to throw parties and guilt us into coming. Today she is throwing a party for her father who died a year ago. I am very sympathetic, but she also has told us that in a few months she is throwing  a party for her dead father on his birthday. It also happens to be my birthday that weekend. Last summer she planned a weekend for her to babysit our kids. Then once that was planned she tried to have a family reunion that weekend and told us we had to attend to pick up our kids. Because of Covid there wasn't a venue and it didn't happen but I'm certain this is going to happen again this summer. Previously I have lost trust as she was babysitting our child and took her a few hours out of town without telling us. Like downtown cities, or visiting people with my child without telling us. Am I being over sensitive or is this entitled/boundary pushing behavior. Thanks for listening to my vent.
