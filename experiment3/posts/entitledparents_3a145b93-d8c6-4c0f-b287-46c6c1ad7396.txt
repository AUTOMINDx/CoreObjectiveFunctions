Entitled Mother gets Angry at US for HER kid trying to start a fight
This happened a long time ago, but I still live next to the people involved and I still think about it, and I have nothing better to do at 1 in the morning, so here’s go

M: Me

D:  Friend

B: Brother

Ek: Entitled Child

G: D’s sister

Em: Entitled Mom

Me, my brother, our friend, and Ek were playing with Nerf Guns. Eventually, D’s sister G wanted to join. However, Ek didn’t want to play with any girls. Me, D, and B all thought he was being stupid. D told him to shut up or leave, and Ek became aggressive. Eventually, Ek threatened to attack him, which D said go ahead. Ek tried to shove him, but messed up, and wound up falling on the pavement and running inside. We go back to playing Nerf when suddenly, Em comes out. 

Em: What did you guys do to my son?

B: We didn’t do anything. He tried to shove D but fell

Em: You attacked him! 

D: No I did not. He wanted to fight me, but I didn’t hit him or even touch him. 

Em: That doesn’t matter!! You can’t just pick fights with my son! You need to show some responsibility! (Looking at me because I am the oldest one here)

M: Responsibility for what? Teach your kid not to pick fights if you’re so worried

At this point, Em is just pissed and rambling off about how it was our fault or whatever. We went back to playing Nerf, but we were very annoyed by this entitled woman. Thankfully, the kid has straightened out a little, but I haven’t talked to or seen from the mother much and honestly, I’d be okay if we kept it that way.
