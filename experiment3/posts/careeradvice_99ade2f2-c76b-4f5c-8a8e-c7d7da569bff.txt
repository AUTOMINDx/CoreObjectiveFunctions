How soon is too soon to leave a job?
I have been working as a data analyst for the past 9 months and although I like what I do I don't necessarily LOVE it. The work I do is very templated and I feel that my skills aren't being utilized to their full capacity since I am not able to code as much as I would like to. I am considering going on a "job hunt" sometime soon to see what else I could find for myself that could fit my needs, but I am worried that perhaps I am leaving this job too soon. This is my first job out of college, but I do have other experience (such as internships and coding competitions). I would like to get other people's input on "how soon is too soon" to move on from a job. Would this look bad on a resume if I were to leave this job after 9 months to a year?
