Didn’t have interviewer’s email but found them on LinkedIn. Is it appropriate to message them to say thanks?
As the title says, I do not have the email address for the person who interviewed me but I have found them on LinkedIn. Is it appropriate to message them that way, even though we are not connected, to thank them for their time?
