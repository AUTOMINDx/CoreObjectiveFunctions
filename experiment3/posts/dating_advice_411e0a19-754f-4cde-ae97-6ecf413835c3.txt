Are men in Computer Science a turn off?
I was talking to this girl I met while playing tennis, and we had a great conversation. Then she asked me what I’m studying at school, I say CS, and she got noticeably disappointed. I asked her what’s up and she said she prefer men in other fields like business.

Is that true? Can any woman chime in? CS degrees have great job prospects and very high salary compared to other fields, so why does she dislike it?

I assume cause of the nerdy stereotypes associated with computers?
