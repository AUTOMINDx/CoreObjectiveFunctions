Supervisors making fun of me behind my back for asking questions as an intern?
Pretty much the title, I didn’t catch the whole convo but I was able to pick up enough to know they were making fun of me for a recent question I asked. It was about me double checking if I was handling a new piece of equipment right since it was my first time and they were not there. I didn’t want to risk messing up, so I called them just to be sure. 

When one of them walk by my cubicle they looked sheepish and said ‘oh I didn’t know you were back’, and I acted like I didn’t hear anything. 

I’ve been told I’ve been doing a good job; I come in early, ask questions, take initiative about projects etc. I feel like if I was doing something they didn’t like they would let me know because it’s obvious I care. 

What does this mean? What could I have done to trigger this behavior in my superiors?

EDIT: Wow, guys I can not thank you enough for all the support and advice you have given me it has really meant a a lot. Honestly, I did not expect to get this much feedback and positivity, I don’t even know what to say, thank you doesn’t seem like enough. I wish everyone the best in everything they do bc you all deserve it for being wonderful people:)
