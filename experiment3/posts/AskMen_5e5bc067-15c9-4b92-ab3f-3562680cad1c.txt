What do you think about during a blowjob?
I’ve always been curious but have never asked a partner. Do you usually fantasize about other things, or are you able to get off at the feeling/action alone? I’m not a huge fan of having someone go down on me, so I don’t have much to compare it to as I usually finish that job myself. I’m interested because I enjoy giving blowjobs, but I’ve always wondered what’s going on in their (other) head while I do it. I know everyone is different, but I’ve wanted to ask for a while.

EDIT: Was not ready for this to blow up! I am pleasantly surprised that the most common answer was simply enjoying the moment. Thanks to everyone for answering.
