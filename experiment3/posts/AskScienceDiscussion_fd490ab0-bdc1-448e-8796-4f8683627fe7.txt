How long does a leg hair last on the human body?
The information on Google says the hairs on our arms and legs only last just 30-45 days before they shed off, but I notice that there are some specific hairs on my legs and thighs that don't shed for a year or even longer. So how long do hairs usually last on our legs before they get replaced by the new hairs? How long does it usually take for a follicle on the legs to grown into a certain length then shed off?
