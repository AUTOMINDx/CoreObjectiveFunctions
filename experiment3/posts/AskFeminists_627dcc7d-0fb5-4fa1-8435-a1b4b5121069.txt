Are women judged more harshly if their partner/preference for partner doesn't fit the conventional beauty standart?
Especially if their themslves are conventionaly attractive. From my experience the reactions always seem to be: 1) she is with him for money or  2) she has insecurities and wants to have power in the relationship. I haven't seen similair reactions nearly as much when the situation was flipped - everybody sort of took it as true love. I rember thread on reddit where similair question was asked... the answers from the women said that they got constant comments from strangers if they thought that the man wasn't beautiful enough for them, the answers from the men weren't as dramatic, if my memory serves right. Also when women state some unusual preferences there is always large group of guys telling them that they are lying and are not attracted to that. Like as a man, i admit that i'm guilty of this too sometimes (not commenting on it, but i always wonder why is she with him, but that's pure projection on my part, i always hated myself for not fitting the male beauty standart , so when i see couple like that i wonder...) What do you think about this? Has anybody personal experience with it?
