My PTSD wants me to throw away all belongings &amp; move out of state to cleanse myself of the trauma
Has anyone experienced this? It wants me to throw everything away, including my documents(drivers license, birth certificate), and perform a "cleanse ritual" at separate airbnb rooms on the way to make sure that I've "cleansed" myself of this place and finally feel free.
