Saturn and speech
We often hear that when you have Saturn in certain houses it can cause delays- for instance with marriage or kids. But what if you have Saturn very closely conjunct Mercury - can this have a negative impact on your communication skills?

I am thinking of social phobia, fear of speaking in front of a crowd, a great discomfort with speaking on the phone, hating to hear your own voice etc.
