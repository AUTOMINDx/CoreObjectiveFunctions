What’s a decent monthly income in America?
I’m 15 and starting to look at different jobs for out of high school. I made a similar post and was asked to make a more specific post that mentioned stuff like living style cost of living in the area and such. I wouldn’t plan on moving far from home (rural area in west Michigan) and it seems like it’d be rather cheap but what do I know. I don’t plan on having a big house or kids just wanna buy cool shit with engines and be able to go on trips every now and then. I don’t wanna have to worry about essential stuff or bills. What would be an ideal income?
