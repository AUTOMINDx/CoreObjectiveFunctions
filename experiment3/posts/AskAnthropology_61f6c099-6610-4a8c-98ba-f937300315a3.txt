What info do we have about the early spread of Afro-Asiatic people and languages into North Africa, and specifically on the origins of Berber and Chadic families?
Hi, searching info on Afro-Asiatic languages is so hard. Most info seems to go into Semitic languages, but there's very little on Berber and Chadic for example. So I wanna ask what do we know about the early spread of this language family into North Africa, and the development of early Berber and Chadic languages? For the little I've read, the Capsian culture seeems to be a good candidate for Proto-proto berber or some distant ancestor, as well as that Ibero-Maurusian ancestry is present among imazighen and chadics. However little more I found.

So what do we know? How old did Afroasiatic languages spread into the Maghreb, and when did they come into the Sahel giving birth to Chadic? What genetic component could be associated with this early berbers and chadics? And how related are they? And where would their urheimats more likely be?
