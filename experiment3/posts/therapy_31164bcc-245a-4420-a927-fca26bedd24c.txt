Advice for Dealing with a Difficult Therapist
Hello Reddit. I need advice today. My boyfriend recently needed to get taken out of work due to his depression and could only find one therapist in our area to help him out. Long story short, the therapist has been nothing but trouble. She didn’t make him feel heard during their sessions, and when it came time for her to fill out the paperwork letting him get paid while he’s out, she doesn’t want to do it. She wants him to do it. He can’t. He literally can’t because he’s not the practitioner. Now she’s telling him to go to her house and bring his laptop so he can help her sign up for whatever website to fill it out. All while telling him that he’s being annoying for asking all of this from her right before the holidays.

This all sounds like a load of BS to me, and it’s making his depression worse.
So I ask, this isn’t normal, right?? We’re not crazy, right??
If this doesn’t sound right, what can we do to remedy the situation. We’re already low on cash and if he doesn’t get paid we’re gonna be in trouble.

Thanks to anyone that takes the time to read this and help us out &lt;3
