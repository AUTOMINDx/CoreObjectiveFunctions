What if the Toba Super-volcano never erupted? How would it affect the Homo genus today and how would our world and society differ?
I know the volcano almost wiped humanity out and estimates range that there was only 1,000 to just 40 (which I know is highly unlikely) remaining breedable humans left on the whole planet, practically destroying our diversifying gene pool.   

I was reading something very interesting, and basically it was explaining that the Toba eruption probably set humanity back tens of thousands of years by shortening the gene pool so drastically, as well as almost wiping us out, and that the Toba eruption could have even cause the last ice age. It also hypothesized that if it nearly wiped us out it had to of made at the very least 1 other rising hominid species of the Homo genus go extinct entirely.   

My question is what if this never happened?   

Would there be other species of humans present all through out human history and living amongst us in our society today?   

How would the development of human civilization and society be changed if other species of humans other than sapiens were present?   

Was it for the best that this did happen?   

Would we already of colonized other planets?   

Would Homo sapiens today along with any other species of humans alive be much more diverse in biology if our gene pool was allowed to continue to spread and diversify?   

How would the ecosystem of earth be different if Toba did cause the ice age?  


My curiosity is killing me and I now I have WAY TOO MANY questions! Iâ€™m just asking any of you scientist out there if you could answer just one of my million questions lol.
