Can a drink actually be “more hydrating” than just water, or is that just made up to sell sports drinks?
Basically title. How can something hydrate you more by adding electrolytes or salt? Surely the amount of water you’re putting into your body is the only measurement of how hydrated you can be? I’m torn between “I don’t know enough about electrolytes to question it” and generally assuming all marketing/advertisement is lies.
