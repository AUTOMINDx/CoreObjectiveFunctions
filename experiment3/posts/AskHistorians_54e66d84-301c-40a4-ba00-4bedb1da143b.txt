Why is the US extermination and removal of the Native Americans not considered a “genocide”? Is this not labeled as a genocide because of a true consensus of historians on the historical record, or is this purely ignored due to political reasons?
The actions of the US Government against the indigenous Native American tribes seem pretty clearly consistent with the accepted definition genocide (there is a great description by u/dhowlett1692 [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/p5v7lp/native_american_genocides/h98ryuu/) ). Is there a true consensus on this topic among historians? I imagine political pressure is a major factor why this would be an *unpopular* label to brand the US government with, but is it a label that is deserved?
