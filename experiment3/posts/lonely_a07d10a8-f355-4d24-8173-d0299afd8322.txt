I wish I meant something to anyone
I never felt like I mean something to anyone or someone consider me as a close person , I mean I appreciate people and some of them are close to me but I never feel close to them I knew people online and real life but when I stop making effort to stay with them , everything changes its always me approaching everyone and I really hate it , Im not an interesting person at all
