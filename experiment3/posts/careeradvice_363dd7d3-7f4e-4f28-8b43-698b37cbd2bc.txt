I got into Big4 with a 3.0 GPA
Hi everyone,

I recently received an offer as an analyst from Big4 (Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG).

The minimum GPA required was 3.3, but I still applied and got an offer.

I am not proud of my GPA, and yes, I struggled A LOT during my college years, but I was able to get back on track during my final semesters. I was also having difficulty finding internships. All of my other friends were getting internships at larger companies, but I received no responses from "brand" companies.

I sucked it up and got internships at small to mid-sized companies that no one had ever heard of. My school was not even a top priority; in fact, we had a bad reputation for Big4.

Everything worked out in the end. Not only did I receive an offer from Big4, but I also received a couple of other offers from mid-sized and well-known IT firms.

So, if you're looking for a job (especially if you're still in college), invest in yourself. Put in the effort and time. Don't worry about getting brand names if you don't get any, like me, because what will get you a job are:

1. Experience and the ability to talk about them.
2. The Quality of your work
3. Interview Skills/Strategies

If I could do it, you can do it too :)
