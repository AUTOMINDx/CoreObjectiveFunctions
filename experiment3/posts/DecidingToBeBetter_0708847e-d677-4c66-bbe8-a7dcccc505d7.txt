I have no life, no friends, job, confidence, nothing going for me at all. I just wanna end my life. I do not know how to fix my life. where do i start?
I turn 19 years old in 2 months. I graduated highschool not long ago and I have been laying in bed and playing video games and watching porn and youtube all day ever since.

I have no friends, no girlfriend (and im still a virgin) nor a job. i dont even have any hobbies. whenever i try to make a change i give up quickly and then start back at square one.

I also have immense envy towards teenagers, especially younger boys, who are living better lives than me. boys who have hobbies, girlfriends (or experienced sexual activities before.) friends etc. I know what im gonna say next will be controversial... but I also envy teenage boys who have sex with attractive older women. Whenever i cases of female teacher-male student sexual relationships on the news I cant help but wish to be them. In general however, i envy young teenage boys who experience all the things i wish i could.

I feel like such a fucking loser. I have nothing to do all day and my life has no direction.

I have no motivation or ambitions and im sick of wasting my life.

where can i start? what can i do to fix my life?

EDIT: To those of you saying to get a therapist and start taking medication, im already am. i have been taking therapy for years and im on antio depressants but it hasnt helped much.
