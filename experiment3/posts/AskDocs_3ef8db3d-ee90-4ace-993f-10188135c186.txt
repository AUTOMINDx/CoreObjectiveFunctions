3 years, No diagnosis, Losing hope

Hey All,

I’ll try to keep this short, but here is the deal. Since early highschool my energy levels have always been low, my body has generally felt quite sluggish. I always just attributed this to long school hours and work. My dad would joke, “its like you got the hangover without the party”

About 2 years ago I was done with school and really made an attempt to increase my health and energy to actually enjoy my days. For the next year or so I attempted to improve health through a consistent sleep schedule, diet, regular exercise, vitamins/supplements, you name it, I tried it. But after feeling consistently worse I began to seek medical help for:

**Symptoms:**

Extreme fatigue

Overall joint pain, but focused on my back

Constant tired burning muscles (as if I climbed a mountain)

Canker sores on soft tissue 1.5in+ in diameter

Morning nausea

Chills

Hard lumps on lymph nodes

No stamina

**Since July of 2019 I began experiencing “episodes” consistently every 3 months**

Fever 103+

Mouth sores 1 in+ and tonsils covered in lesions

Bed ridden

Muscles burn

Inability to eat or drink due to mouth and throat lesions

My docs were highly unhelpful as this was the height of covid and docs were quite busy. For the most part I was passed around with little to no results. I am self employed and this is the only reason I am still able to work, as my last episode had me bed ridden for nearly 5 weeks. I was prescribed Lidocaine, magic mouthwash, acyclovir, VitD3. None of these helped

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, and 6 doctors later, I now have $8,500 worth of blood work done. Everything is normal, except I am anemic and discovered 5 herniated discs in my lumbar and neck. My iron levels are ok, but red blood cell count is low.

I have been tested for mono, flu, covid, recurring strep, rheumatoid factor, ana reflex, vitamin levels, thyroid, sleep disorders, allergies, just to name a few. All came back normal.

Docs are at a loss and don’t know where to go next.

I have been turned down by Rheumatology, ENT, Hematology, due to lack of symptoms (more or less I look too healthy to hold a place in the queue). I have been told I have “the exact same symptoms” by friends and family with diagnoses like RA, Lupus, MS, Gall cancer, gout, lymphoma. But I am getting turned down by specialists so tests are not happening.

My daily physical health has slipped to a point of now affecting my mental health. I need answers and cannot continue much longer like this. Nothing I try improves or alleviates any pain. I don’t know what to do next.

I will do my best to answer any questions!

Please and thank you for any and all advice or similar experiences!
