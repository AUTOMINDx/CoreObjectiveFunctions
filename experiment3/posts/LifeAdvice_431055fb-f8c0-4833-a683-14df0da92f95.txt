One of my friends was shot and killed this morning. Still can’t process it
I never thought I’d have to ask strangers this but a friend of mine was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting this morning. We went through highschool together, had the same job and I was the one driving him to and from there. I’m only 20, with him being 19. I’m sad but don’t feel sad. I’m angry but don’t feel anger. Mostly I’m lost. I’ve been thinking about it, yet haven’t shed a tear. Is this numbing feeling part of the grieving process?
