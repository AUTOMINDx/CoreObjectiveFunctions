I [F] keep hearing men will cut off girls who don’t put out until the 3rd date, because their resources are wasted. But how do I make sure I won’t get played or ghosted?
I’ve read this and other subreddits, and men are pretty clear with the fact that they’ll cut off a girl if she isn’t ready to have sex by the 3rd date, because they think she’s “leading him on or using him for his resources”.

I personally don’t understand how can a girl (unless she’s homeless lol) use a guy for his resources if we’re talking about regular coffee dates. 

My problem is this: I am not ready to have sex too early. I just physically don’t get as aroused as I need to enjoy it and make it a nice experience for both of us. 

I’ve slept with men on the 2nd date, who seemed to be interested genuinely in me and put in some effort, but their energy changed immediately after sleeping together. Last guy stopped texting as often and enthusiastically, even though he told me many times “we should do this again”, but eventually we never met.

**How to know when to put out? If I go on dates regularly, and keep having sex with these men out of fear that they will think I’m not interested, hell, my body count will be 50 with diseases by the time I’m 30!**
