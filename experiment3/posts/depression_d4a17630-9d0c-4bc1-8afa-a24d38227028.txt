The pain of high functioning depression
Life has really taken its toll on me the past 9 or so months, and I've come to terms that I have high functioning depression. It's nasty and bitter because the only person who really understands is my therapist. People see me working 50-70 hours a week, working towards what I want in life, doing all of these activities and such, but behind closed doors I'm a mess. Its hard that I truly feel like if I failed I have no safety net, that it's truly me against the world. That because I'm a man this is the way it's supposed to be - essentially shut the hell up and deal with it on your own. At the point of not even wanting sympathy, just someone who could recognize or relate to my pain. I know in the long term I'll be OK but some days it feels like the world is really crumbling down around me and no one sees that.
