Thoughts on the scrutiny around male and female toxic subs?
Just saw a post about a stupid post in female dating strategy which is fair cause they are a pretty toxic sub. 

This post isn’t really about the weird shit they post in FDS but rather how people view male led/focused toxic sub and female ones. I feel like women are under so much more scrutiny in society? And even online like when people call out posts in FDS there’s a bit more judgement on women as a whole. That women can’t do wrong when we preach about feminism etc and that all women stand for toxic shit if the toxic person is a woman. I don’t think women get as defensive about it as well as there’s nothing to be defensive about or a need to say “not all women” because it’s obvious. 

However I feel like it’s not the same with men. If a man gets called out for toxic stuff it’s very quickly “not all men” and the defensiveness can quickly also turn quite toxic. 

Could it also maybe be to societal stereotypes as well? The old idea that women are just harmless when rlly anyone can be toxic.
