Emotional abuse is still abuse
I'm so tired of it not being recognized the same as other types of abuse. I've experienced physical, sexual and psychological abuse too and by far the emotional abuse messed me up the most. 

I was just denied access to low cost trauma therapy because my issues weren't "severe enough", simply because I stated that my "primary" trauma was surrounding emotional abuse.
