Dating and Shame
Imagine being a 39 male in this day and age in the dating world and how much CEN has robbed out of the life that could have been dating wise.  Due to the years of self hatred, shame, being afraid of feelings, has prevented me from being in a relationship.  Imagine meeting the lady that I really like and you are lucky to go on a few dates, that day will come she will ask "how was your prior relationships and what happened"  how would she think when I say "oh I have never been in a relationship".  For most people that is a huge red flag in the dating world... that would create shame.  Then I would have to explain that CEN is a big part of what and why, then spill my guts, then hope they understand, dont judge and still would continue to go out with me.  

Would be great if I can get female feedback how would you see that man.......
