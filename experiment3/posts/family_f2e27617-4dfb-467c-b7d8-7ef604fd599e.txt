I think I am turned off from wanting kids
I (34f) went to the Renaissance Festival with my friends (also in their early to mid 30’s), and they have 2 kids. One is 6 and the other is 3. So it was me, my friend, her husband, and their two kids. I felt like they invited me with them just to help them watch the little one the whole time. The 6 year old was very good and very behaved and so polite, but the little one was a huge ball of hyper and literally all over the place. He kept leaving the group and running off. I wanted to go catch a show at a certain time, so we started heading there. By the time we got to the show, we only caught 5 minutes of it because on the way there, the 3 year old kept running away and everyone kept having to chase him around. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Is this really what it’s like? I don’t think I could do it. I was extremely exhausted at the end of the day because of how tiresome it was to constantly watch over him and chase him around….and I wasn’t the main adult out of the group watching him. I could not even enjoy my time there, and they were not my kids. If we put him down and decided not to carry him, we held his hand, and he would try to wiggle and pull his way out of your grip and run off. 

I quit taking my birth control because my boyfriend and I are starting to plan to have a child. But now I think I want to get back on it! I’m not joking…it was so tiresome. I am at the age to where I need to decide on having a kid or not, as I am turning 35 next month. If I decide not to have any kids, I am worried that I may regret it late when it’s too late. I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR My boyfriend and I are planning to have a kid soon because I am about to turn 35 years old. Now I am not sure because when I went with my friends and their kids to the Rennaissance Festival this weekend, their 3 year old kept leaving the group and running off to places and it was exhausting. I felt like we watched the kids the whole time and did not really enjoy much of what was around us. I am completely turned off by the thought of having a child.
