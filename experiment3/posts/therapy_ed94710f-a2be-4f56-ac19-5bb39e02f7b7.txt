What do I say to a therapist on a first session? I think just listing my problems would be kinda overwhelming (?)
So I am currently looking for a therapist, and I was wondering what is the best approach on a first meeting. I imagine he'll ask something like "so what's troubling you?", and I'd have like one thousand possible answers to that question.

"I feel unmotivated towards everything"
"I feel like I'm unlovable"
"I have great difficulty in interacting with people I don't know"
"It takes me an incredible amount of mental energy to do basic tasks"
"I feel like I'm not living, I'm just killing time"
"I can't focus on what's important"
"I feel that I'll be alone forever"
"I see no future for me, I think whatever I do will eventually lead me to failure"

It would feel kinda overwhelming to me, how do I take it more slowly? What's the best approach to have on a first meeting?
