Is anyone else more depressed than anything at the moment?
I’ve just spent almost the whole day in bed. Just having many thoughts, although I don’t remember how I passed the entire day other than by sleeping at one point. I’ve had to fight this full-bodied exhaustion for nearly 2 years straight despite medication. It’s always either me having to be very distracted and out and about all day, or passing out in bed all day and scrolling endlessly on social media (I don’t even have many, just Instagram). Frankly the only self-care I do are the mandatory ones like eat food and taking a shower before I sleep for the night. 

Things are getting so repetitive and mundane. Maybe things are getting bad again. 

Honest thought: Honestly it bums me out sometimes that my depression is worse than my PTSD because it feels like it invalidates all the PTSD symptoms I have ongoing at the same time. Like… am I really traumatised if I’m so depressed I can’t move much? Non-stop racing thoughts coupled with absolute physical and mental lethargy is brutal, I can’t escape either.
