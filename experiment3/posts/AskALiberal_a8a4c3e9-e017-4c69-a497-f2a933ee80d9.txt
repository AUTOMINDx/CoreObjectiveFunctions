If a substantial amount of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, and right wing media are found to have participated in causing the Jan 6 insurrection, do you actually think that would change anything for Republican voters?
From where I’m sitting, it doesn’t seem like it matters to many Republicans whether or not their party tried to overthrow the government, because it was a Democratic government. 

It seems that hatred of the Democratic Party and fear of racial minorities, immigrants, and falling in the national hierarchy have effectively guaranteed that most GOP voters will remain GOP voters til the end. 

So do you expect the investigation to sway them?
