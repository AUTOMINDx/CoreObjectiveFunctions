Resigning on Christmas. Bad move?
I've just accepted a fantastic job offer while on holidays. The tricky thing is, I won't be able to send a resignation letter to my current company until I get home on Christmas Day.

Is this going to make me look bad/unprofessional? I plan on sending it as soon as I can, its just super inconvenient timing.

Edit: bit disappointed to be downvoted, I'm just asking for advice.
