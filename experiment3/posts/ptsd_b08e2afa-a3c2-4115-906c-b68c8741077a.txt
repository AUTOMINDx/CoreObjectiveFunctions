Suddenly going emotionally numb while crying?
I’ve realised that when I do cry about my trauma or anything related to my trauma, i maybe sob for like 30 seconds and feel a yawn coming, and then my emotions kinda just get switched off as if as easily as the flip of a switch, and i stop crying immediately. Not even the sniffles, I just completely stop and turn off. It has made it really hard to process my trauma and i minimise my trauma because of it, because I feel like a fake if I can just flip the switch off just like that. My chest just goes empty too as if I’m over it, or like I never thought much of it in the first place (which is not true because I feel a lot of pain and grief from it that usually kickstarts my crying).

Does anyone experience emotional numbing like this too? 

I’m in the 6th month of my latest, most severe trauma and have diagnosed ptsd. I do experience some dissociation and did dissociate during my traumatic events. Not sure if that info is relevant.
