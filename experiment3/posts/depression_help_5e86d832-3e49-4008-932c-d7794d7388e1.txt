No Christmas spirit. Loosing will to live.
First I want to assure anyone reading this I do not plan to take my own life. I am just really struggling with wanting to keep living. I am very numb. The holidays are never easy. The holiday season of 2007 I lost 5 family members/close friends. One of them being my grandmother, my best friend in the world. She has a heart attack on my 10 birthday and she died two days later. December 5 2007. The next day my aunts two sons (my mother myself and my grandma had moved from Louisiana to New Jersey so she could be with her sisters and brothers before she passed) told my mom and I we needed to move since Mary (my nana) was dead. My grandmother adopted my mom and they said since she was dead we where no longer family… we became homeless. For the last 14 years every holiday season is a reminder of everything I’ve lost. My mom works every Christmas because money has been almost nonexistent since she died and we became homeless the first time. Since I turned 16 I have also worked every Christmas. Except this year because I was hurt at work in may. And I have been on work comp since. This holiday season is darker and worse than others. 
Today I tried to talk to my “best friend” about it and she just called me a cynical bitch and told me to get over myself. I know other people have it way worse but for my own so called best friend and person to just tell me to get over it makes me feel even worse. And I didn’t think that was possible. Being on work comp since may has made my mental health 1000 times worse. I’m proud of myself for not relapsing and self harming or relapsing with pill abuse especially with all the pills I have at My disposal because of the injury. 
I know this became a random rant but I just have no where else to turn. I feel so alone and just like I am a burden because I am so depressed and broken. Mentally and physically.
