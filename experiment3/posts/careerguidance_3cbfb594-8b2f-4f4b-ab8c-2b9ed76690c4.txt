Is there a career path for a currently unskilled disabled person who has to work from home?
I currently receive disability due to MS and multiple spinal issues.  I want to work.  I cannot work in an office or traditional workplace.  I need to work from home due to my need to be able to recline and/or sit in a place that doesn’t hurt throughout the day while working.  I need to be able to rest as needed.  I am in search of a career that allows me to adjust or make my own schedule.  I have no formal education. And my 20 years in the workforce were largely spent in customer service and managing customer service in call centers.  I considered work from home call center opportunities in my state, but the expectations and stress associated with the job are what made the job impossible in the end of my working days.  And here, they pay barely minimum wage.  After medical benefits, my take home would be less than I currently receive.  The health impact isn’t worth it.  I am trying to think outside the box, and look for something I might not have considered before. I am willing to pursue training or schooling if it can be completed from home.  My cognition has a very small decline, so going for an advanced degree is out of the question, but a minimal, shorter term educational investment I could do.

Does something legitimate exist out there for me?
