Been depressed for maybe 6 months finally did something I’m proud of
Today I woke up and laid in my bed and I didn’t feel like offing myself. I woke up gave myself sometime. Made my bed and did 4 months worth of laundry

It was actually disgusting but I finally did something

Yesterday night I took a shower and took care of my skin actually putting moisturizer and taking everything slowly instead of rushing to my bed and sleeping without showering, or anything.

I felt much prettier and healthier and feeling much better for myself. My goal is to take care of myself in a much healthier way and to stop putting myself aside

Edit: I just came home and very overwhelmed from the nice comments. I was afraid someone would be rude but you guys are amazing. Thank you guys for making my night and day☺️
