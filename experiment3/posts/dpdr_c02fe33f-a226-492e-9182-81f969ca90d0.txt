Why I’m perpetually stuck in a dissociated state
I’ve recently been talking to my counsellor about my dpdr, which has led to massive realisations about why, five years later (after a bad weed trip), I’m still living in a constant state of dissociation. 

I realised that as long as I don’t feel safe, like on a deep, subconscious level- my dpdr will remain. And due to my current, not-ideal life circumstances, I do not feel safe. 

I live at home with my parents because I am very reliant on them for support with my mental health and college; but I am also always under the pressure to ‘behave’ and the threat of being kicked out, as as soon as I stop being able to ‘cope’ and do what they expect of me, I am threatened with being kicked out. I know that if I am kicked out, my life will be at risk and I will also probably be alienated from the family. 

My childhood trauma (child sexual abuse, neglect) means that I am much more prone to dissociating than someone without it, as infants and children who have experienced these things instinctively dissociate to be able to cope at the time. I know I did. 

So - I’m not going to feel safe or secure anytime soon. And so my dp/dr will remain. 

I hope anyway that this post will at least bring some understanding to anyone else still stuck in the throes of depersonalisation &amp; derealisation. x
