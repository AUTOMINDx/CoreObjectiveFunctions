Sharing Subway with T
Every year I mark an anniversary (telling the police about my abuse) by eating the same food (Subway) that I ate on the fateful day. 

This year is a special anniversary and it falls on a therapy day. I’m wondering if I should ask my therapist if I can eat it with her. I guess I’d be looking to have company while remembering.

 My therapist and I have a great relationship and she has a pretty open “anything I ask for, I get” policy. So I’m not afraid she’ll decline. Just looking for your guys’ thoughts. 

If so, do I offer to bring her a sandwich as well? The same thing I have or something different?
