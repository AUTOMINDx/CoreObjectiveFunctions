From my experience please apply at jobs that post how much it pays or ask up front
I’ve done quite a few interviews with large companies this past year. Three times they’ve bait and switched me. Telling me on the phone they can come close to what I’m asking. Then when I get the formal offer it’s no where near what they said. 

It’s so annoying. I work full time so looking for work seems like a second job itself.  So may personal time off days I’ve used for interviews and for what? It’s frustrating. 

I’m thankful I have my current job to fall back on but it’s a waste of time when some companies bait and switch their salary.
