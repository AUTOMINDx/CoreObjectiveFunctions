How should the US military restructure the sexual harassment assault response and prevention program?
It's been around for about 10-15 years or so but rates of sexual harassment and assault have still gone up. Vanessa Guillen wasn't murdered by her harasser but the entire fiasco led to the Fort Hood report which showed the entire program so far has been a pretty miserable failure. I mean I like to think we've moved beyond the fatalistic "Hey don't go to SSG Creeper's office, he'll do something weird to you" from the 90's and early 2000's. 

If you were the one sitting in the big chair at the Pentagon, what would you make different?
