App to sort through photos on computer?
I'm looking for an app to help sort pictures of my computer and phone. I'm imagining something where you go through all your pictures one-by-one and you can press a key to move it to certain albums or to delete it. So like, "n" is my pet album, "t" is my memes album, etc. Any advice on apps to help clean up and organize your computer? I just dont want to go through it manually and move each picture manually.
