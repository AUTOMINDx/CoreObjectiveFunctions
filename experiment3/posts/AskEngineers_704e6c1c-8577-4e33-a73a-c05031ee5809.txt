As a career mechanic, I'm burnt out on turning wrenches on things. It's been suggested I go back to school for engineering. Any suggestions or advice for a tool monkey?
EDIT: Thank you all so much for your insight, tips, advice, encouragement, stories, all of it. Going through a ton of comments and I'm gonna try to respond to everyone. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. You all kick ass!
