On a tidally locked planet, would there be a permanent breeze coming from the freezing side through the habitable zone to the scorched side?
Or would it be a very strong wind since the difference in temperature between hemispheres would be so great. Would a smaller tidal locked planet have stronger wind since the two sides are closer together?
