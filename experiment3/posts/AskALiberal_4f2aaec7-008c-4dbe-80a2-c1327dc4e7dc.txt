What left wing idea is a bit too far out there for you?
Pretty much just that. What left wing ideas just go too far for you?

I’m not talking about “communism” or something. Im talking about left wing ideas actually in the conversation right now. Could relate to abortions, guns, taxes, reparations, you name it. What is just too much for you?

Edit: As I review the comments the top contenders so far are UBI, reparations, gun control, abolish the police, and identity politics. In no particular order.

Edit 2: I always get ratioed to hell on this sub. Worth it for these answers tho.
