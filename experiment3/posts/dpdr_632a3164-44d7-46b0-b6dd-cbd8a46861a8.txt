Does anyone else nearly constantly find themself obsessing over what most people would consider totally inane?
Like, when I had DPDR for the first time it all revolved around the meaning of life, then after that it went to the existence of free will, after that whether pessimism was realistic or not, lately it has been the whole nonduality/no-self thing, and throughout the whole time (and still now) I'm also very uncomfortable about the concept of deconstruction in fiction.
