For whoever needs to hear this:
1. Your depression is NOT who you are. Your depression is trying to trick you to believe you are worthless, undeserving, undesirable, etc. negative and self loathing.

2. Avoid having fixated thoughts. It’s easy to fall into the trap of your brain running 200mph in circles when you start to feel anxious. Doing this will mentally strain you from coming upon solutions, and creates clutter in your mind that /feels/ impossible to overcome.

3. If you are feeling stressed right now, find recluse in a part of your home that you feel most safe in. I’m sitting on the rug of my bathroom as I type this. Sometimes silence can be therapeutic.

4. Another great coping mechanism is writing in your notes whether it’s your phone or a physical note. Express your feelings in ANYWAY you see fit. For your eyes only!

5. One thing that has helped me greatly is doing exercises in ethics/morality. Such as: define your personal definition of “truth” “lie” “justice” “death” “freedom” (etc. etc…)

This is a very thought provoking exercise that grounds you in reality. Next time something makes you uncomfortable, you may have more strength to logically think through what is the best reaction and way to deal.

6. Sometimes, hearing and truly sympathizing with what someone else is going through in your real life can help humble you. I didn’t realize how much time has passed when the girl who “stole” the guy I had the biggest crush on in high school told me that her brother just killed someone in a DUI and will likely be serving 15 years. Knowing that other lives are being lived you really don’t normally see the lows that people go through on social media.

Good luck everyone on their recovery journey. Brighter days are to come.
