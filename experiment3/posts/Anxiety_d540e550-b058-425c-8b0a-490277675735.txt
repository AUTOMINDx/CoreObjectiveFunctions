Stop scrolling! It’s almost time for bed. This work week is going to suck, but also be great. You’re one of millions dealing with the same issues. You’re not alone. Everything your feeling is normal.
I hope you had a good holiday weekend. If you did congrats! If not, don’t stress about it. Some holiday seasons suck. Usually I get really depressed after Christmas is over. But I won’t let that happen this year.
