OCD, infidelity, pregnancy irrationality: How to get over my husbands past?
I (25f) love my husband (25m) a lot, but I have been cheated on by both him, and my one other ex. We had made huge improvements in every way and even started to leave behind my pain and resentment from the infidelity, until last night. I am 6 months pregnant and suffer from OCD, it’s clear pregnancy hormones have made me irrational and left me filled with intrusive thoughts, more than I’ve ever experienced prior. The one huge issue we have in our marriage is sex, but not the way you’d think. I have the high sex drive, and I value sex significantly higher than he does. I feel/share love through the experience and originally thought I needed a deep connection to enjoy sex. Recently I’ve come to understand that I’ve actually never had good sex and the lack of interest from my husband eats me up inside, despite him having a colourful and vibrant sexual history. I believe we are just sexually incompatible. 

Last night he told me that he reminisces about previous sexual partners and how great they were. I lost it. All the hard work to overcome the infidelity, all the trust, the pregnancy, the fear, the lack of my needs getting met etc; to say I am overwhelmed is an understatement. I had my worst OCD episode I’ve ever experienced and now I’m left with… is this marriage worth saving? Am I being irrational from this pregnancy? What do I need to do to overcome these potent emotions to have a healthy relationship?

Thank you for reading, a desperate and hurt woman.
