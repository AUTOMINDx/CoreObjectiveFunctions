Finding my sense of direction
I honestly just wanted to vent and I’ll keep this brief. I’ve faced a lot of adversity in life as an immigrant born to parents struggling financially. I eventually become a first gen college graduate (without debt) which I’m very thankful for especially with all the hoops I had to jump through to get financial support as well as working 2 jobs at Uni. All at the expense of my mental health with the reassurance that once I land a job after graduating things will be okay. Long story short I graduated at the height of the pandemic, lost one of my parents and currently my other parent is living outside the country in harsh conditions. I’ve never had a chance to take a breather due to financial circumstances and im at my breaking point where im honestly crying at work everyday barely keeping it together. This is my second job where I ended up like this, all I’ve got is bills pilling up with no connection to this job I once “dreamed” about. At the end of the day I just want to be with family, have a sense of housing security, and rekindle my passion for my interests/hobbies without contorting it into something I can sell. 

How do you people continue this 9-5 cycle?, or what gave you strength when you are emotionally drained from this capitalistic hell?
