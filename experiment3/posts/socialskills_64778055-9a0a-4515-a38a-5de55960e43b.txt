I’m 25 and look younger and I’m tired of getting hassled by EVERY customer about it
I work at a dealership in the service center and literally EVERY customer asks me stupid questions like “Are you old enough to work here” “Shouldn’t you be in school” “Does your mom know where you are” 

And I’m OVER it. Other than saying I don’t answer person questions what else can I do to get these old rats off the topic. I can tell them I’m 12 or 45 and no matter what I say they don’t believe me and just give me a hard time either way. I understand I don’t look my age but Jesus Christ I’m tired of hearing every person give me shit about it
