Am I an alcoholic?
F21, I would joke with my colleagues that I was until I realized I would be drinking every day. I got even more concerned when I’d start drinking when I was alone/sad. I’ve blacked out numerous times this year and ended up in the hospital for an incident leading to a concussion.

It’s interfered with my academic needs and I’m not sure if it’s the college atmosphere or an actual issue. I’m typically very outgoing so I don’t necessarily drink to loosen up, alcohol merely relaxes me. Let me know your thoughts.

Edit: I just woke up and was not expecting an insane amount of responses. I’m trying to reply/read to as many as I can, thank you all.
