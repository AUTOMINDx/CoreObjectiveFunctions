Is it bad to think things shouldn’t be cancelled because of omicron?
It genuinely doesn’t make sense to me that events in places like NYC are being cancelled where you need to be vaccinated to go. Isn’t the whole entire point of getting vaccinated to be able to live a little bit more normally after 2 years of being safe? 

The Strokes concert on New Year’s Eve was just cancelled and I’m being honest when I say it was the only thing I was looking forward to in months. Why do I have to be punished when I did everything I was supposed to? It’s getting upsetting and feeling like it doesn’t even matter what I do anymore

Edit: I am sorry that this post is tone deaf. I am grateful I am healthy and boosted and that I haven’t gotten Covid. The comments about not spreading it make sense and I do understand the reason for these cancellations. I am just sad about the life I could’ve had without Covid and I feel like it’s valid to be upset and sad about what we are missing out on! It was more of a rant post than a genuine question

Edit 2: I am kind of blown away by the aggression of some of these comments and the disgusting messages I am getting. You wouldn’t dare utter a word of what you’re saying to someone face to face, so please consider that before you hit enter.
