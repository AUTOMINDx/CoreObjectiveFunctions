AITA for asking my parents to reimburse me for the money I wasted getting a diagnosis I already had, because they withheld my medical information from me?
I recently spent $2300 out of pocket getting assessed for autism and ADHD at the suggestion of my psychologist. I was diagnosed with both, which has allowed me to get financial assistance and accommodations at uni, so it's very useful in the long term but it was a huge blow financially.

When I mentioned to my parents that I'd been diagnosed, they told me it was completely unnecessary because I was already diagnosed with both at age 6. They had never told me or anyone else about my diagnoses because they didn't want me to think I was different and didn't want me to be treated differently. Spoiler: I already knew I was different, I just didn't know why and thought I was a freak, same with every school bully and even some teachers. They were even told to put me on ADHD meds but they didn't.

So I asked my parents to reimburse me for the money I wasted on getting assessed, because it was their fault I wasted it. If they hadn't kept my own medical information from me, this would never have happened and I would have been able to get accommodations from the very start of uni which would have made things so much easier for me. They watched me struggle socially and academically for 14 years and never bothered to explain why or get me help for it.

My family is pissed at me for asking to be reimbursed. They think it's rude and my parents didn't do anything wrong, they were just trying to protect me. They even keep saying that my autism stops me from understanding why they did it and that me asking for reimbursement is rude. I think it's reasonable that if someone's actions caused me to waste money then they should pay for it. They had 14 years to tell me, if they didn't want me to know while I was a kid they could have sat me down when I was 18 and told me, but they chose to withhold my medical information from me.
