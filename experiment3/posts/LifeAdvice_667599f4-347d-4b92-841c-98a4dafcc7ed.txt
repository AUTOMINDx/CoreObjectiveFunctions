Suggestions for quiet work with no degree?
Alright so here's the thing. I had to leave my job recently. Customer service job. Been there for two years but the rush and noise had me working myself into mental knots. I'm looking for new work, but I basically got lucky with my last job hunts. I have no idea how to look for good work effectively. So I guess I'm looking for suggestions for quiet work. Thanks for your time.
