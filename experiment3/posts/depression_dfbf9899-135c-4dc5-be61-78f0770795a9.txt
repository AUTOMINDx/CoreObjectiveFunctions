is it okay for my mom to call the way i dress slutty?
I'm a 15 year old girl and I dress in pink and cutesy like skirts and stuff I had some pink fishnets on and she said that it looked "slutty" she also said "that's what people wear when they're about to have sex" I  can't look myself in the mirror anymore i feel so gross...i need some advice (she did this on my 100th day without self-harm)

I have major depressive disorder and anxiety it a has been very hard for me it has been going on for 4 years now well now 5 years since the year is ending.


Things she also did: make fun of my self-harm , choke me 2 times, she also wants me to go to a mental  hospital when I didn't even do anything yet like (self-harm) , she doesn't care about my 100th day without self-harm and she blames a lot of things on me like when I caught her hitting her boyfriend at the time she blamed this on me and other bad things but yeah I just need advice...anything honestly helps...

(I had tights on underneath the fishnets)
