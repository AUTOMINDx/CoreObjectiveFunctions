PARENTS: do you think a parent's dedication to their child ends when they turn 18?
Not sure if dedication is the right word, but my Dad thinks that once we turned 18, his role as a Dad ended. Curious to hear other parent's views.

EDIT: thank you to everyone for your considerate and well thought-out replies. You sound like great parents. My Dad just called me to apologise and said that we should make an effort to spend more quality time together. I think a lot of his initial response to the situation was him feeling defensive of me criticising him as a parent. I guess a part of growing older is realising your parents are people that also have triggers and immature responses sometimes. I’m still hurt, but I hope it’s something we can move past.
