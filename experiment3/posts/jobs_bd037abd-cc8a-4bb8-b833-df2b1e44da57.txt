Got a verbal job offer. Then 24 hours later they said they no longer wants to proceed.
I interviewed for an IT role at this popular  company. One week
Later they called to congratulate me and asked when can I start I said in 1 week. I was so happy! I went to celebrate with my friends and family. I was so excited about the new role. Well next day I sent them an email to ask when will i get a written offer later. They replayed with “ we are sorry. We decided not to go with the position”. With no detailed explanation. I don’t understand what went wrong. I asked for more details and they said it’s not about me and that they just don’t want to proceed with the position. It was So unprofessional and disappointing. Can anyone weigh in as to why would a company change their mind after offering the job?
