Does anyone else constantly get freaked out by their own existence
I don’t know how to explain this. But every five seconds my brain is like “wow, you exist” and it makes me feel so disconnected from both the present and the past. Like I’m constantly so aware of my own consciousness that it freaks me out beyond. 

I wish I didn’t feel like this. I feel like I’m watching my life from the outside, like I’m a third party observer into my OWN LIFE. It’s so frustrating. I’m on Luvox and Abilify for my OCD and they are helping sooooo much with that, but they haven’t even *touched* my DPDR. Idk what to do :( my psychiatrist hasn’t formally diagnosed me with DPDR because he says it’s a comorbidity of my OCD. But god, this sucks :(
