Need advice
I don’t know what I’m doing in life, I feel so lost and lonely. I’ve been trying to work on myself but it’s been difficult. I can’t seem to motivate myself nor discipline myself to get on the ball. I feel stuck and been emotionally unstable, as well as, constantly thinking about my ex when it’s been 2 yrs and I can’t get over it. I find it pathetic.
