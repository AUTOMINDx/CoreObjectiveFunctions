AITA for humiliating my little sister by making her publicly admit the texts sent to my husband were from her?
I left my husband a month ago. It pretty much has turned my life into a shit show and if I get a divorce, I’m sure my family are going to disown me. My little sister (she's 19) was very worried that she wouldn’t be allowed to talk to me anymore so she decided to take my phone last week and beg my husband to give me a second chance through texts.

He didn’t even reply and I had no idea until Saturday when we both ended up at the same party of a mutual family friend. I only found out because he told me to ask him in person and he would consider giving me a second chance, and made it seem like I was begging for him back to my dad. I was confused and angry so I was ranting to my older sister. She knew what my little sister had done and told me.

I was furious so I told my little sister to go and admit to him that she sent those texts. I went with her and she confessed to him in front of a group of people since he wouldn’t agree to speak privately. My sister hid for the rest of the party and my husband said what I did was cruel. My little sister hasn’t spoken to me since.

AITA?
