Boss is asking me to fully commit as a new hire and it seems unreasonable
I’ve been at my first job for 3 months. My boss keeps trying to get me to sign for benefits bc. I’m a temp. Only issue is I’m under the National average in pay and I’m doing manufacturing work where I want to do design.

I’m at a small company that’s trying to grow. My boss says stuff like we’re going to be 15x the size in 3-5 years and I’ll be a big name with my own office but I have to commit to going beyond a 9-5 right now and (in my opinion) breathe this company. 

I don’t want to get pigeon holed into manufacturing and that’s what I’m afraid of if I get good at doing it. What’s stoping them from hiring someone with design experience once I make them a bunch of money?

I’m not even getting paid that much right now 65k a year. I give him no enthusiasm when he tells me this stuff about being a big chief guy because the work is boring and I think it makes him nervous.

With nothing lined up before I quit (Im applying though), I’m thinking about moving back in with my parents self studying tech for a few years to transition from ME because what he’s telling me sounds unreasonable. Am I justified in my thinking to at least quit?

Also all my coworkers are lifers at this company, and it’s a pretty lean team where everyone has domains of specialty and the training I’ve been getting is “ask questions”
