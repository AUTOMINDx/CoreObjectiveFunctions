Having a good day produces many bad days
I feel like I crash really badly after trying to do better. 

I take a positive attitude, drop the negative thoughts, stand up straighter, run some errands, make a phonecall. Then later that day or the next day I will get really anxious about everything, everything becomes too dauting and I get very stressed, depressed and tired. Everything collapses - housework, habits, etc - for the next few days at least and I feel totally overwhelmed.
