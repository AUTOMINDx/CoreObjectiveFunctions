Is The Second Sex worth reading?
Hello everyone. For some context, I'm a 17-year-old guy who came across De Beauvoir through her existentialist philosophy, but I also want to read more feminist literature. 

So my question is simple: Is the Second Sex worth reading/is it a good book? I have heard that it is outdated and problematic, and De Beauvoir herself did some very unethical things.

Thanks for the help!
