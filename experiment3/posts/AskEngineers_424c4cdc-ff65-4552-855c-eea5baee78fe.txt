Senior/Lead Engineers, what are two things you wish you did early on in your career?
Hi all,

A few questions for the older/advanced engineers. What are two things (or three) you wish you had done or learned early on in your career? What would you recommend to younger engineers? What was your biggest mistake or something you would absolutely advise against? If you could do it all over again, what would be different?

Thanks all.
