I still just feel so defeated
Everyday I try to convince myself I’ll be okay eventually, and every day it’s becoming harder to do. 
My heart, head and body are so drained, my heart aches every day and I just don’t want to feel this anymore. 
I want to be here for my wife and son, but I have no clue how much longer I can hold on. I sit here at work, typing this with tears in my eyes wishing I was stronger than this.
