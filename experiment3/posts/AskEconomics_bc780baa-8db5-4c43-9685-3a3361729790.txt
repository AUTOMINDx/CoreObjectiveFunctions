Economics of Bounty Hunting in fiction?
Often times, there will be a work of fiction where bounty hunters hunt people and get the bounties on their head? How exactly would stuff like that get priced? 

Was thinking that the break even point for the organization issuing the bounty would be the amount of damage that the individual would cause for them had they not issued the bounty.

And the break even point for bounty hunters is expending less resources than the bounty amount.

Is there anything examining this sortof thing? Are there any similar concepts?
