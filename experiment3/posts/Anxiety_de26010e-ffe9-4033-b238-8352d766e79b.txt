Why am I so mortified when a shop doesn't have what I need?
Today I went into a small local shop to buy a loaf of bread. The minute I walked in, the girl at the counter told me to close the door "properly". Not in a mean way, just very blatantly. There were three workers in the shop and me and one other customer. Then I asked a different worker, if there was any bread left, and he said that there wasn't so I said no problem and left. Why am I so upset by this so ordinary encounter?

For context I'm quite a generally anxious person.

I just want to thank everybody for their thoughtful replies. You've all been so kind and have made me feel much better about this situation. It's so nice to know I'm not alone in how I feel! :)
