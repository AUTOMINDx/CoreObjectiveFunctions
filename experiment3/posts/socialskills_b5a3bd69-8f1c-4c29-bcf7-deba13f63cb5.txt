Does anybody feel unimportant?
I didn't knew the write word for this in caption but anyways I have been experiencing this for years, like my opinion/thoughts/feeling/actions doesn't hold any importance to other ppl, for examples in group work among classmates, whenever I start speaking, everyone went quiet after some time, same is with my friends whenever I'm talking to them they usually brush off my opinions/thoughts. even talking among relatives, my opinion usually get sidelined/made fun of. Due to this I have gone quieter over the years but it's still better than worthless tries to communicate.
