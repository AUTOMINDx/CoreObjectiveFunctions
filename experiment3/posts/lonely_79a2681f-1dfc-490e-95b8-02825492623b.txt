why as a girl is so hard for me to find genuine friendship online?
(19F) It really shouldnâ€™t be this hard, I am sure there is guys and girls who want friendship but I cant seem to find them, even when girls reach out, they make it very inappropriate. I am starting to lose hope :/ what happened to the good online friends who text all day? Is that not a thing anymore? I tried to reach out to someone on here who seemed in a bad place mentally only for him to make it inappropriate (very inappropriate actually, he just wanted a girl who gives him nudes and not friendship like he claimed)
