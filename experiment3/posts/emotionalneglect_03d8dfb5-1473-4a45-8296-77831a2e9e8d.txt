A key way I neglect myself: Responding too late and then too impulsively
I think I’ve identified a key way that I fail to take good care of myself. In responding to personal needs and life issues, I have a tendency to respond too late, by postponing doing things, ignoring problems, and dissociating (e.g., substance abuse) until things escalate to what feel close to personal crisis levels. At this point, I tend to act impulsively, out of anxiety, and often melodramatically, not taking into account my full range of personal needs and the longer term consequences of my actions.

The cycle is self-maintaining, as I usually feel bad about some part of my impulsive actions (e.g., feeling helpless/hopeless throughout, how I appear to others, outcomes), which I respond to by ‘responding less;’ that is, postponing, withdrawing, ignoring, and dissociating until the next crisis comes along. In turn, things are usually more daunting and urgent when I respond last-minute. The result of this seems to be that my quality of life and self-esteem and -efficacy continually deteriorate.

A fair amount of my ‘responding too late’ is unconscious through having low awareness of myself and my needs. For example, I may not recognize how upset I am about something until it’s keeping me up in the middle of the night or causing physical symptoms. To be honest, I don’t like ‘sitting with my thoughts’ these days, as things aren’t going well for me and they haven’t been for a while.

I guess I need to have courage and faith that deliberately attuning to my needs and responding sooner and with more wisdom will yield better results for me than the default mode I learned from childhood. Part of me genuinely believes I’m capable of doing better, even though I haven’t seen strong evidence of that in years.
