Can someone please, ELI5, how did England go from War of the Roses to world power in just a couple centuries?
ELI5 = "Explain like I am 5 years old"

I just sat down to watch the recent film The King and was pondering about all of the chaos and infighting that took place in England.

Celts -&gt; Romans -&gt; Anglo Saxons -&gt; Normans -&gt; ? kings ? -&gt; War of the Roses -&gt; Parliament -&gt; ??? -&gt; Queen Victoria and lots of colonies

Thats all I know. At least all *I think* I know 

Bonus question: WHen did England become a UK? And did Ireland fend off the Normans?
