The GERD diet is literally ruining my health.
Since starting this diet, I've gone from 170 to 149 pounds at 6 foot. The combination of low fat and small meals isn't working because I'm not getting enough calories. I'm a skeleton. On top of that, I have heart disease and my bloods are showing I am getting malnourished. There was a big scare because my potassium had dropped to dangerous levels, and given that I'm a heart patient that is bad news. I'm a really busy person, so I don't have time to eat every hour. I get at most 5 meals a day. Sometimes only 4. I used to just eat 3 bigger meals, and I'm probably gonna have to go back to that because this isn't working. I managed to fix my potassium by downing potatoes (can't eat a lot of melon because of fluid restrictions). I guess I used to get a lot of it from avocado and cashews. God knows what else is low since I can't eat anything healthy for me. But yea, this is not sustainable for me so I guess I just have to have horrible LPR for life.
