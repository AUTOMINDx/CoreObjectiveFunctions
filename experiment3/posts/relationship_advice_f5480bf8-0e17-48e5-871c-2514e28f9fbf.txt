Wife doesn't chip in
Hey, need some advice
I [M 30] married my wife [F 32] one year ago.
We both have high paying jobs. Life was good till until recently. I basically have to financially support my family now, and I'm beginning to feel the strain.

My wife refuses to chip into anything. She wouldn't help buy groceries, fuel, bills, anything. She asks for new dresses etc, or would straight up ask for cash - despite saving 100% of her income.

This annoys the hell out of me. She wants a kid now. I'm not sure if I want to keep this up.
