Current employer asking for a breakdown of my previous compensation?
I'm pretty sure I'm under no obligation to disclose this information, including a copy of my 1 month payslip with my previous employer. They said they're doing this as part of their recruitment process in order to compare it with their package for me. It feels wrong and makes me feel like I'm gonna get low-balled in the actual offer. What do I do?

Edit #1: Thanks for all your advice! I already emailed them regarding this telling them that I believe I signed an NDA regarding these confidential information and would rather discuss and negotiate based on the market rate for this position as well as based on my current skills and experience. Still waiting for an email back and will update asap!

Edit #2: So after I emailed them, they told me that they understand it's confidential info (which made me think 'then why ask for a breakdown even if you knew?'), but they still asked for my previous base salary because they said that that will be the basis of their offer for me (????), so to get them off my back I just gave them a number and sure enough they stopped asking, so yeah now I'm just waiting for what they'll offer, but I'm really doubtful if I'll even consider based on what i went through.
