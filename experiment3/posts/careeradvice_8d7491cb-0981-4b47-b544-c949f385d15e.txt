Job posting with higher salary
[Canada] I've been working for a company for about two years now and was considering switching jobs to get better salary.  While searching for a new job I found an ad from my current company from two days ago describing my exact position but offering at least 30k more per year. If I were getting that salary I would be happy to stay on with this company.  Any suggestions on how I handle this?

Note that I have no reason to believe they're unhappy with my work, I just received a bonus out of the blue last week.
