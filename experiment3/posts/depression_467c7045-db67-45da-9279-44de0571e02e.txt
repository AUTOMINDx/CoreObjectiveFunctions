Having anxiety and depression is the worst
I have zero motivation to exist or do my responsibilities half the time but my anxiety makes me do everything anyway as I’m so scared of failure. It just makes me feel constantly tired and I never actual enjoy anything I’m doing because I feel like I have to do it out of obligation instead of choice.

I’m finishing my degree next year and I have no plans or aspirations and I just feel stressed as I don’t want to do anything except lie down and not move or speak for weeks.
