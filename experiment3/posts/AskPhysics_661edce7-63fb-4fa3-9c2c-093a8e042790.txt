Veristasium/Electroboom and Poynting
[SOLVED]

Isn't E=0 outside a wire with current, because the net charge is locally 0? Why do they draw E field and Poynting vectors all around the circuit?

Solution:

I'm considering the static DC case just to get it straight, I know that they are not, but for this matter, the reasoning is the same. 

I'm an MSc student in physics, in my physics-II course, and my digital/analog circuits laboratories, I was always taught this rough model (I'll omit some constants because I'm lazy, but it doesn't matter):

the current J=σE, E constant inside the wire and parallel to it, E=0 outside (0 net local charge), B=JπR²/2πr azimuthal outside of the wire so that CurlB=J (R is the radius of the wire, r is the distance from the axis) and B=Jπr²/2πr=rJ/2 inside the wire.

It turns out that in reality, you have a superficial charge distribution on the wires, that monotonously changes along the circuit and globally sums to 0.
This charge distribution clearly creates E fields inside and outside the wires.

This has nothing to do with the dynamics, it's just a diffused misconception about the static circuit configuration! This was the matter of my disappointment, I was taught wrong. &gt;:'C

Thanks to everyone who helped me to sort this out.
