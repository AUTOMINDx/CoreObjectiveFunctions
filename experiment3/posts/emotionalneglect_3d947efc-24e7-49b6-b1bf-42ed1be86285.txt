Being the scapegoat
For those that were cast into the scapegoat role by their Nparents, when did you realize this is what happened?

I've recounted many experiences online and in therapy and have received feedback indicating I was scapegoated. While it makes sense to me, I'm also in denial, similar to how I was at first in denial about being abused.

Was there a moment of clarity that made this feel irrefutable? I find it's the same struggle I face when saying I was abused. The inner critic that goes, "it wasn't that bad", or "you're imagining things", or "isn't that all just part of being a kid?"

What makes the scapegoat the scapegoat? Why can't I accept that this is what happened to me?
