im literally dead inside, most likely nobody will see this
im (21m) I’ve had MDD for as long as i can remember i always been a quiet person back in school, was always bullied i only ever had 2 girlfriends in high school, it was short lived and not good, im also a virgin so that always destroys my self esteem, i grew up in a emotionally abusive home, i’ve been in the hospital 8 times i would hurt myself and try to off myself, again im 21 and there’s no end in sight. i have nobody to speak too im out of work and nobody will hire me im going crazy and nobody seems to notice or care, idk what to do anymore
