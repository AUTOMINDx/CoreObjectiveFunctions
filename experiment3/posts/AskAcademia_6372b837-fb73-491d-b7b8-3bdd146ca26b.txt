Finishing my PhD, considering MD. Best route?
I'm about 2 semesters from graduation (neuroscience). Looking into jobs and realizing MD is still something I think about. Originally thought being a PI was just as satisfying but I'm really not enjoying writing this much (grants, reviews, publications) and thought it was something I could learn to enjoy. I can see myself in an industry position but science policy is really the only other area I think I'd enjoy and I'm worried it's a lot of writing as well. 

Main hesitation is that my undergrad was in psych over 10 years ago, so I have no chem prerequisites. I know there's some universities without course requirements. And some MD 3 year accelerated programs. 

Main attraction to MD is being more patient facing, active physical job (I'm just doing data analysis on a PC most days), always interested in neurology case studies. I'm thinking of finding a doctor to shadow after the holidays.

Anyone went this route? 
Any advice on prerequisite issue? 
Am I just having a midlife crisis?


Edit: thanks for the responses. I know it would be a lot of work, and no, I don't enjoy being a degree collector. While I can get well paying jobs as a PhD in industry, I've yet to find something that I know I will enjoy as a long term career. Though selling my soul to consulting and making money to buy a house is always a consideration. I took 5+ years off between undergrad and grad school, still working in research labs, so a science career is something I've always enjoyed - not just avoiding reality with school. I would first shadow an MD before making any decision. I'm just weighing options right now, seeing if someone has advice of something I'm not aware of. It sounds like the comments suggest there's a huge wall to climb over, but the reward could be worth it - should I not find something with a PhD in the patient setting that I enjoy.
