Is there no way of faster than light communication with quantum entanglement.
Quantum Entanglement as far as I understand happens instantly. Faster then light speed. Roughly if one of the entangle particles have an up spin the other is found to have a down spin. We can't force the outcome of one or the other we just know both are opposite when it's observed.

Thus it is not possible to create a faster than light communication system yet. My question is, is this a limitation of our technology. Or is quantum entanglement not the phenomenon that can help us play real time video games with a friend from mars.
