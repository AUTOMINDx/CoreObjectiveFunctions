the thing no one really understands
i lost my dad from cancer when i was 16, and my mom spiraled into alcoholism and drugs. she has drank beforehand, and was definitely an alcoholic before, but this made it worse. i was basically under her thumb until i was 25, because she had died days prior to my birthday. nobody understands how much she controlled me, how i couldn’t leave. they say “oh, you were an adult, you could’ve left.” she had control of everything. she was in control of my car, my phone, my bank account. she made me stop taking antidepressants when she found out. she almost sent me to a conversion therapist but settled for a regular one (she impersonated me on the phone and gave them all my information to sign me up) so i could talk to someone and “realize she’s right.” she controlled me more than my sister, mentally abused me more, gave me C-PTSD, and would essentially threaten death if i ever crossed her. but yeah, why didn’t i just leave right.
