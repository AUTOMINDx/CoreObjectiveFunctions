What else can I do?
Ok so here is my situation.

I am 16, and pregnant. I know I screwed up. I went to a party in July and let a guy talk me into doing things. 

When I found out I was pregnant I had an oh shit moment and it took a few days to settle in. I also realized that I need to grow up and change my behavior. When I told my parents they were understandably upset. My mom burst into tears as she was yelling at me and my dad just said he wasn’t my dad anymore. 

I am now 20wks along with a little girl. I’m planning on keeping her. I’ve got a part time job at a diner, and I tutor a few middle school kids online durring the weekend. Im maintaining A’s and B’s in school, mainly A’s.  My friend group has changed and I don’t party anymore. I’ve also been helping more out at home. Even am trying to learn to cook. 

My dad won’t even be in the same room as me. My mom is at least civil to me now  but she will also make comments about how she can’t even trust me when I go to the movies or something like that. 

I don’t know what to do to even start repairing this. So I’m here to ask; what else can I do?
