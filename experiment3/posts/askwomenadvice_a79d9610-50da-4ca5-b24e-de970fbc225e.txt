Husband[31M] mad at me at a bar because I didn’t give him details of a man being creepy?
My husband has been known to have big anger reactions, especially when drinking. I also feel that nearly every time we drink a lot together, he finds a reason to get mad at me, so I’ve avoided it a lot lately. But some good friends of mine were in town over the weekend and I wanted to celebrate and let loose with them (my first night out drinking since the summer, meanwhile husband has had lots of nights out drinking and getting sloppy, sometimes with me there being the DD). 

A man came up to me in the bar and told me repeatedly I was beautiful. Then he came up to my friend and I a little later and started saying weird shit about his circumcision or whatever, I don’t know. My friend and I just kind of laughed and turned away. My husband came up a minute later and asked what that was about. I shrugged and said I would tell him later; I was having a good time with my friends and I didn’t feel like spending my time rehashing what some loser was doing. Husband didn’t talk to me for the rest of the night. When we got home, he basically unleashed, saying I was trying to purposefully hide shit from him. I refused to engage with him while he was drunk but I am upset and disappointed that once again, a night out resulted in this. 

Was I really so wrong? How do I talk to him about this today?

Edit: he is still not talking to me this morning, he still thinks I was wrong for “avoiding telling him something important because I’m afraid of confrontation with him and so that (apparently) means I’ll hide anything from him”.
