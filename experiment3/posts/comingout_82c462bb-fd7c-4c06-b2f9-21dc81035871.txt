Short story and my current situation
First of all, this is a throwaway.

I started to find out I was gay when I was around 13.  I was brought up in an extremely religious household and extended family, so I denied any feelings I had.  I went so far as to force myself to have a "crush" on one of my best female friends.  As high school rolled around, I was once again enrolled in a parochial school.

Fortunately for me, I spent a lot of time online, running into atheist YouTubers\*. Initially, I was skeptical, so I only watched the "flat earth" videos.  Eventually, I started watching anything by them, including the anti-religion ones.  After a couple months, I was finally able to admit I was an atheist.  My worldview was completely changed.

As the days and years went by, I made a great friendgroup and started accepting who I was (completely in private, however).  The end of last year, I found out half my friendgroup was either LGBTQ+ or an ally.  They are what led me to completely accepting myself and trans folk, which had been harder for me to accept.  So massive thanks to them!

My previous plan was to completely hide my identity until I was 21/22 and was financially independent.  Unfortunately, my mental health wasn't great and I knew the stress was starting to affect my fa√ßade.  I had to confess to someone.

That leads to today.  I was finishing a road trip with a childhood friend.  I had been planning to come out on this day for weeks.  My plan was to confide around noon, maybe after lunch.  But I chickened out.  So I planned for \~30 minutes into the drive back.  I chickened out again.  I just couldn't do it.  When we were finally close to home, I opened my mouth, and STILL COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING!  I knew the only way I could say something is if he started a conversation, so I had to wait until we were saying goodbye.

As we got out, we started talking about the trip, exchanging goodbyes, etc.  As I was about to leave, I was finally able to do it.  He said nice or something, idk exactly.  All I know is that I was accepted.  I still feel something, I'm not sure whether it is fear, jubilation, or just a general emotion.  Even though I'm still in hiding to everyone else, it was worth it.
