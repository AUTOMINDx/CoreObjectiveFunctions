Strange IP address scanned on my local network
Hi everyone!

I've just recently installed Lansweeper on my home server and it's scanned all of my devices and brought back all their information but it's found and brought back a strange device/IP address which is starting to worry me. The IP in question is [77.75.149.62](https://77.75.149.62/) and when I look it up online, i get next to nothing back except a location and the ISP. It's a Ukraine based address and the ISP is [Головна - Dataline](https://dataline.ua/). When I google the DNS name that is found ([okolita-mix62.dataline.ua](https://okolita-mix62.dataline.ua/)) I get back two search results, both of which aren't helpful.

Does anyone know anything about this IP address or have seen something similar to this before? Does anyone know how I can remove it off my network and find out how it got there? Any help would be appreciated. (I'm quite techy so hit me with all you've got)

Here's a list of the devices I have scanned, including the one in question - [https://imgur.com/a/NzWCbFq](https://imgur.com/a/NzWCbFq)
