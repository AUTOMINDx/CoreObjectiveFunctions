“I would like to avoid actual religious texts because I know they are so subject to interpretation and then I'd be resorting to scholarly materials eventually anyway. There are some "For Dummies"-type books available that could be fine, and I may use those if I don't find anything more interesting. Some examples of subjects I would enjoy researching:”

Islam

Christianity

Judaism

Taoism

Buddhism

Hinduism

Odinism

American indigenous peoples

Black equality

women's equality

LGBT+

East/Southeast Asian people

Latin Americans

impoverished people

incarcerated people
