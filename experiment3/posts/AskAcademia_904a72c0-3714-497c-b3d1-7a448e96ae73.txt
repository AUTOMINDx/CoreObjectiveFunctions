When did the publishing model become so effed up?
I don’t think there is a business model where an entity gets paid for acquiring the product and selling it! I understand if authors pay to publish in not-for-profit journals. But how come we have to pay to publish in for profit journals and endure all the biases of selection and even unqualified reviewers (Even in big name journals)? When did that become acceptable? And shouldn’t we do something about it?
