Military Continuity Through Regime Changes
During a major regime change / revolution, what typically happens to the existing generals / military elite? Assuming some switch allegiance to the new regime, while others are ousted.. is there usually a major loss in experience, knowledge and effectiveness? How is this mitigated?

Thanks for any insights!
