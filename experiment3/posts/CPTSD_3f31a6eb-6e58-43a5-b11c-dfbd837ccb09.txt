The time spent laying awake in bed trying to fall asleep is the most difficult part of the day
I lay in bed with what feels like a tornado of negativity. My anxiety get to it’s peak, every bad or embarrassing thing I’ve said or done, every negative thing someone said to me at some point keep taking over my mind. Every instance of abuse flashes through my mind as well.

All because I can’t fall asleep with anything but a fan on, and when given the chance to wander, my mind wanders into my pain. It’s so frustrating. I feel like I can’t go to bed until I’m exhausted, and even then I lie awake for 30-40 minutes before sleep finally comes. I miss getting a good night sleep with out feeling so much hate and pain

Does anyone else have this problem at night or any specific time of the day too?
