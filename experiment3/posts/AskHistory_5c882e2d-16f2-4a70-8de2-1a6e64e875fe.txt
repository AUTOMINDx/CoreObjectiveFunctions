At what point did US war movies started becoming realistic by not making every American soldier a hero that would have a heroic death?
While listening to the Band of Brothers podcast Tom Hanks mentioned that he didn't want to portray the American soldiers as heroes that would die by "getting shot and holding their hands at the heart". In older movies we can see how whenever a soldier dies he becomes stiff, straightens out and collapses before dying, but in newer movies we can see whenever a soldier gets shot he stumbles over and dies realistically. At what point did movies start taking the realistic route?
