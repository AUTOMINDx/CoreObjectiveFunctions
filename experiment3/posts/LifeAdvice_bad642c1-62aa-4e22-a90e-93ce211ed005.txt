How do I find my purpose in life?
I’m 28f. I have no hobbies, nothing I’m good at and am having trouble finding something to do that I love. My husband has it made. He has a great company and he’s just great at talking with just about anyone. But me? I’m literally nothing.  What do I need to do to find myself? I’m so lost in life i feel like I’m a huge burden.
