[CA] I’m an hourly employee, but my employer said I am treated as salary
So I just started working at a public university as an hourly employee. Today is my third day and my boss and I have a discussion about my job duties/salary/etc. 

Something that my boss said kind of didn’t resonate with me. She said “now I know you are an hourly employee but you are expected to be treated like a salary employee”. What this means is, my job sometimes does events on the weekend, or overnight where I will be working after my scheduled time of 5 pm. On those extra hours or days, I won’t get compensated but I can take a day off to compensate it. 

I didn’t question it then but just now, I start thinking about it. Is this a common practice ? Is it fair to not pay overtime and instead of just having a day off? Any insight is appreciated, thanks.
