Does anyone else get overwhelmed by social media except for Reddit?
I’m noticing people tend to stress me out a lot even though I want to be a people person. 

Social media has so much happening and it just always feels fake. Both make me feel anxious

Sometimes it feels like I’m the only one that feels like this. It feels like everyone is on social media. Sometimes it feels like I **have** to have a social media page in order to fit into society. I honestly just deleted my Instagram and kept a small spam page that makes me happy a little but I might delete that too. 

And honestly social media I don’t have anything against. I wish I could “fit” into it somehow but the more I try to engage the more stress I feel. It looks cool and has so much creativity expression on it. I don’t know why even when I changed who I was following and the content I liked which therefore changed my feed that showed on my home pages yet I still was getting stressed. 

Reddit is the only thing that calms me down. I can spend hours on here just reading how people feel. I’ll even comment and it feels like my comments will be noticed and not pushed to the side with spam commenters. I can help people with my words as well. Overall it’s the only app I use. 

Can anyone else relate?
