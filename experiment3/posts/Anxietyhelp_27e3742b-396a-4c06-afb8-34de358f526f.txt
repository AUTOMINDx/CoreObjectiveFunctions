HiðŸ˜Œ
I have a really great life, yet somehow I still manage to constantly drown in dark thoughts that keep me so tense and cold almost all the time. Most of the time they arenâ€™t even making sense and are completely unreasonable yet weigh me down so much. Whatâ€™s even worse is the possibility that Iâ€™m drowning the people I care about too. Iâ€™ve been getting into short workouts and meditation, and it helps with panic attacks, but sometimes the anxiety is just overwhelming and I canâ€™t help but shut down. I just hope that one day Iâ€™m as happy with myself as I am with the rest of my life.
