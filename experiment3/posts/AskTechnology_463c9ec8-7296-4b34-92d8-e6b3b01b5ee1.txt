I am going to buy a 5.1 surround for my pc, but I only need a 2.1 setup. Is that ok to use it that way?
Before commenting on why? 
(Trust Gaming GXT 658 Tytan 5.1)

I am getting an incredible deal. A setup that cost 120$ I will be getting it for 25$, hence, why I am going to buy this setup and have better quality than a cheap 25$ 2.1 setup.

Now that that’s sorted. On to my question? 🙂🙏🏽

Is it possible to only use 2.1 setup, and then maybe at a later time use the whole setup?

Thanks in advance.
