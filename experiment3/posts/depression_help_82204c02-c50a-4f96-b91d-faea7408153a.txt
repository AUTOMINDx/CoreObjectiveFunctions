I Brushed My Teeth
I know it might seem like a small thing and you might think me gross for it, but I’ve been struggling a LOT lately and that’s caused me to neglect my teeth for at least a week or two. I also have PTSD around dental care which doesn’t help either. 

Today I was finally able to brush my teeth! I’m really proud of myself for it and I hope this is a sign I’m on the road to recovery!! :D
