Going 198% of the speed of light?
Hey so I had a question: from what I understand, speed is compared to something else, so when we're going 50 kmh, the referential is the earth, even though it is spinning and moving etc..

Also, apparently you can't go faster than the speed of light, but what if i decide to go on a train, going at 99% of the speed of light with the earth as a referential, while on a parallel track, another train is going at 99% of the speed of light but in the other way? Would that mean I'd be travelling at 198% of the speed of light with the other train as a referential?

That's it, just a question I had.
Thanks for your answers,
Hugs
