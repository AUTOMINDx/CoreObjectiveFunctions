the netflix show “maid” re-surfaced trauma in me
(There are no real spoilers about the show, but you shouldn’t watch it if domestic violence is triggering for you.)

A number of months ago, my S/O and I watched the show Maid. The premise of the show is that a woman is trapped in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic, has a kid with him, and can’t get out because of financial reasons and fear of losing custody. There are multiple moments in the show when he gets aggressive, and for the last few episodes I cried continuously. Then, called into work the next day. I am not one to cry; not because of gender norms (I’m queer), but because I physically cannot most of the time. 

I saw my mom a few days ago and she told me that she watched it, and it reminded her a lot of my dad who passed away, and was an alcoholic. It had clicked for me then, that watching that show had been familiar but I just couldn’t look away. That show hurt me in a way a show never has. There are times I think my inner child is healed, but this show made me think otherwise. And question if I even want kids or if everyone’d be better off if I broke the cycle. I am waiting for health insurance at my upcoming job to seek therapy. 

My relationship with my family has been rocky for years. At times, my mom and I are besties—and then things will flip and our relationship becomes based on monetary exchange or conditional love. My mother is often the last person I tell my good news too, as she doesn’t have much of a reaction. 

In the cold months when I am lost in my thoughts, I am grateful to have formed a loving family with people I’m not related to. My amazing S/O and all of my friends. This kind of went on a tangent, and I’m not really looking for advice, this has all just been weighing heavy. Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR: “Maid” brought up violent scenarios from my childhood and has made me question my relationship with my family.
