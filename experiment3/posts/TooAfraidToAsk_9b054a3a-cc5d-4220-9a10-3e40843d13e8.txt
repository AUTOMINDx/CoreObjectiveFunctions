Do men really like giving oral pleasure to women?
Or they just say that? And how was your expirience with partners who are not good at it (for you at least). Did you tell them and how did they react? Did they wanted to improve? For years i was thinking i just don't like oral sex but I'm starting to think that i just had a misfortune to stumble upon men who does not want to hear what i'm telling them

Edit: question for women. How do you feel during the act? Do you feel pressure to cum or to show you like it more than you actually do?
