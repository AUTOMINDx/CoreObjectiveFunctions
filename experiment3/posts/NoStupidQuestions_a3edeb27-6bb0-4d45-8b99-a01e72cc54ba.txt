How do I get rid of a crow that flew into my apartment
PLEASE HELP

Literally this big ass black ass bird just flew into my apartment through the open window, nothing like this has ever happened to meâ€¦ 
It went back to the window to leaveâ€¦ but flew back in again. Iâ€™m a bit of a pussy ngl so I dipped out of my living room SCREAMING and am now  watching from afar.
Itâ€™s literally just looking aroundâ€¦ and moving from computer to furniture, to furnitureâ€¦ to the hallwayâ€¦ back to my computer.
Itâ€™s as if itâ€™s trying to spy and get information on meâ€¦ and it has a weird obsession w my computer knocking over my mouse and probably poking at the wiresssssssss
I know crows are smart birds but what the FUCK does it want from me and my apartment ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
How do I get this thing out????????????

edit: it is now 22 days after ive made this post, people were saying how this was a bad omen and i will die or something but nothing bad has happened (yet?) and i am still alive.
