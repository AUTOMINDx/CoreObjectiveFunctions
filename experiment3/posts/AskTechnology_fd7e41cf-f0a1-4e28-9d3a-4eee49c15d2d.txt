What’s a good temporary/burner phone number app I can use for identity verification?
I don’t want to use my real number and VOIP numbers from apps like Google Voice and Burner typically get blocked.

Are there any good temporary phone number apps or web services I can use, or is the easiest thing to get a cheap burner phone?
