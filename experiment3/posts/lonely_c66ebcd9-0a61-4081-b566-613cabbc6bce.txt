loneliness destroys social skill
Ugly and shy people are doomed to loneliness.  I see the reluctance of the people who look at me every day.  I am invisible to men.  For women, I am the background.  I have no one to go to the movies, take a walk with, meet with.  I've got no one to talk.  On the one hand, I feel worse and worse because of loneliness, and on the other, I'm used to it and I can't imagine having friends.  When I have the opportunity to talk to strangers, I don't know what to say to them, I'm not interested in their life, I have nothing to say to them.
