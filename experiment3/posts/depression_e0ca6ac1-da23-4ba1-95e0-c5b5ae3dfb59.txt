I didn't try to kill myself this year
The last time I could say that was when I was 17 (I'm 22 now). I'm not going to lie, it has been very difficult. I've self harmed. I've had self-destructive behaviours.

But I didn't attempt to take my own life. I surely did want to though, I went to bed some days wishing I wouldn't wake up the next day. But I didn't actively tried to die.

To me this is a victory, I'm still depressed but I'm becoming more functional and I feel like I can rely and trust myself more now. I'm not as impulsive as I used to be.
