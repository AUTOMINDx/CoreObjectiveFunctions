What are the chances my best friend pulls through? 30M Covid on ventillator
30M covid/pneumonia. No medications. Was ventilated 8 days ago. Been on max ventilator. 

Last night they called us and allowed us to come to the hospital as his brain activity scan was around 15-18. Doctor told us to expect him to pass within the evening most likely and we got to say goodbye pretty much. He has multiple pneumothorax (tube to each lung). A blood infection that comes and goes with a fever. His kidneys appeared to have failed yesterday. 


We got a call this morning that he is still alive and his heart rate is up and oxygen levels are at 67. 

Should we allow hope to build up? Apologies if this is not the right forum.

Edit: for people asking weight. He is roughly 5 foot 10 and about 200 pounds. Plus or minus 5 or 10 pounds depending on diet/activity probably.
