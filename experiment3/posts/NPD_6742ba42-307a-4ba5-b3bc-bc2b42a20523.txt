DAE find that they gossip ALOT?
I notice I spend 75% of my friendships talking about or giving my opinion on things/situations other people are doing. Maybe bc I have no core i really donâ€™t have much of my own to talk about? Recently I have one friend who used to jump on on the bandwagon for years start to give very â€˜to each their ownâ€™ neutral responses and itâ€™s pissing me off bc I love bonding over shared displeasure/disapproval lol. I canâ€™t even say anything about her recent change without showing how fucked up i am bc â€˜why wonâ€™t you talk shit about people with me anymoreâ€™ sounds awful. I am sure this is why itâ€™s so hard for me to make and keep friends. They probably assume I do the same to them backâ€¦. Sigh why am I like this ðŸ˜©
