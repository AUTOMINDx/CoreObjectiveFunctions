It feels as tho my father doesn’t care to really know me
I keep craving affirmation + interest beyond “how are you” with my father. 

My life is so so so fascinating and I’m living beyond my dreams in many regards —- except he doesn’t seem to care. I learned so much from him growing up — he was my hero — and my villain. 

He was sick last week, I called to see how he was —- “I’m fine fine dint worry about me. “

I know I know…it’s not about him at all. I know that but it still hurts. Hurts like hell. Hurts more so when I doubt myself.
