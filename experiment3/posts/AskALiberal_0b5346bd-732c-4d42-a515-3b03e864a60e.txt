Would you support a law banning corporations from owning residential houses, and limiting the number of houses any individual can own to, say, four?
It's a pretty straightforward question that probably needs no further explanation. Corporations like Blackstone Group own hundreds of thousands of homes, which they then rent out at a profit.

The benefit to society is that more rentals are available for those who aren't interested in the responsibility of home ownership; the detriment is that an entire generation is being priced out of the market.

Is this a situation where regulation is needed?
