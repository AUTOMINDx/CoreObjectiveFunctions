How much more do you think a manager should make than their direct reports?
If I'm a manager and make $75k, what's the most I think my direct reports should make? $70k? $65? $50k?

If I'm a manager and make $200k, what's the most I think my direct reports should make? $190k? $170? $150k?

For the sake of this thread, let's talk % and let's only include base + bonus
