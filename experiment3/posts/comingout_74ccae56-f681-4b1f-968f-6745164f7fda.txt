Finally came out to somebody
I finally came out as bisexual to my sister. I wasnâ€™t planning on coming out to anyone yet, but it just sort of just happened. I have been questioning my sexuality since I was 16 and only recently accepted who I am so saying it out loud to someone else was just a huge weight off my shoulders. She is the only one who I told so far but it feels so unbelievably good.
