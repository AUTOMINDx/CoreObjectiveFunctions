Why is single, male adult life so mundane?
Fellow bachelors, what can I do to improve my social situation? Im sitting here on my couch, playing my Xbox, winding down from the week while typing this now. I’m mid 20s, single, in shape, decent looking, try to be social when I can, make more than the average American in a year, and have my own place. In theory, these are supposed to be your prime years... yet, life feels more empty than it ever has for me. 

I understand people have their own lives to live, yet my 3 closest friends seem to ghost me more and more with each year. Hell, I saw an old coworker randomly at a restaurant. She sounded miserable at her current place so I recommended she apply to the company I work for to try and help her out. Needless to say, she ghosted me...

I haven’t dated anyone for a few years now and haven’t hooked up with anyone for quite sometime now. The level of loneliness I feel gets a little bit overwhelming sometimes and personal relationships you used to have just seem to get more distant with the passing of time. It feels like I did everything right growing up, but for what? To live a lonely lifestyle constantly getting ghosted by close friends and make decent money...? What’s the point of the money if I can’t enjoy it with other people? It feels like I’m confined/destined to climb the corporate ladder since there is nothing else going on in my life.

I used to be a bedroom slayer and get invited out to do cool shit in college as well as a few years after the last year then, but now, nothing... I feel lonelier than I ever have in my life than I ever have before. I want to meet people. I miss my friends and hanging out with them. This is eating at my soul... What went wrong?

Edit: Thank you for all of your responses. I am reading them all here and there as I go about my day...
