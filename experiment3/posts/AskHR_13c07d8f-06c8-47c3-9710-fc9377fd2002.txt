[CA] My work forgot to pay me before Christmas
It's not the first time either.  I'm actually missing an entire paycheck still from back in June and they told me there was nothing more they could do.  I suspected the new gal sent my paycheck to the wrong account and is too afraid to admit it.  I never said a word about it to anyone aside from one other person in the same office.  I had to take up several different side jobs because they already don't pay me enough.  I'm starting to feel like they look down their noses at me.  I scrubbed and cleaned someone's house for 4 hours yesterday so that I would be able to have enough gas to get to work on Monday.  I've had a fractured rib and wasn't going to do the job because I need it to heal but I also have to be able to take my 4 kids to school and daycare and get to a job that clearly takes advantage of me at every turn.  

I've trained two people now that make more than I ever have and they do far less than I ever did. I love the people I work with but what should I do?  I was offered a higher wage somewhere else but I haven't said no to it yet. I think this may be the final straw to break the camels back.  I do too much for everyone around me and I finally may have reached the point where I just can't do it anymore.  I'm not sure how many people could survive a day in my shoes but I know not a single one would want to.  I wouldn't wish this level of struggle, difficulty, and loneliness on anyone.  

Merry Christmas and I hope everyone else is faring far better than I at the moment.  I can't wait to get out of this horrible year.  Can't say I'm very hopeful the next will be much better though.
