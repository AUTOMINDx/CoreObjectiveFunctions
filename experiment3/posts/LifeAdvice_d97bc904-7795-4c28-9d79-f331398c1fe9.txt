What I do? I am lost completely.
Hello I am F27 and I don't know where the hell I want to do or how I should approach life at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize this as much as I can, my teens and early 20s was ruined. I was raised by an abusive mother physically and mentally and my brother was autistic so I had responsibilities at a young age. In high school I never got the choice to choose what I truly wanted to do I only did what my mother wanted, as a result, I ended up with a mediocre bsc in pharmacology which I hated. I ended up doing an english teaching job in japan but I know its not sustainable long term and I havent got any other skills back in my home country the uk apart from the fact my real passion and talent is art and illustration. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I mostly cared about love and having my own family as I am pretty much an orphan now with no family whatsoever (I cut ties with my "mother" years ago) but I had no luck as I have only had short term relationships with men that used me, I have been told many times by men that I am ugly so I have been traumatized and scared of going back to dating. So I have given up on that too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am just trying to get the shards of whats left of my life and do the best that I can because I am almost 30 and I know time is running out for me, I don't know if I should go back to school and start all over considering my age or just build up with what I have got. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking of saving money temporarily whilst I am in Japan and maybe start a business but again I don't know. I am sorry I feel like this is too vague but I have never been able to truly live for my self and I never had the freedom to explore what I truly wanted in life at a young age. I feel like I am just completely a loser and I should give up because I am 27 and nothing that I have wanted has came into reality.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
