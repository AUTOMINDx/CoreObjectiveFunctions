Staying in a hotel with 2 kids will cps get involved
I don't want to be with my fianc√© for a plethora of reasons. He's hurt me, he's lied to me, he's lied about me, he's screamed and threatened to take my baby. If I take my children to a hotel and stay for 6 weeks until I have an apartment would CPS get involved? I'd have plenty of food, 2 beds and a pack and play for the baby. 

I stupidly told him I was done but he just decides we are not. I love him but I'm tired of the situation. I don't have anybody else but I'm sure I'll land on my feet within a few months and the kids will be better off
