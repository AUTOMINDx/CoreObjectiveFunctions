advice on derealized conversations
It’s so daunting talking to people face to face, especially people I don’t really know (strangers, customer service, etc). I immediately want to look away from their eyes. It makes it very clear I’m uncomfortable but I really can’t help it. Derealization tends to put an imaginary fogged glass between me and the other person and it difficult to maintain a natural disposition throughout. 

Any advice on how you guys navigate through social situations without giving into anxiety and panic?
