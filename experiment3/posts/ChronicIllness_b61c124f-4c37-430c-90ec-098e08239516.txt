Obvious advice: Use a tote bag around the house!
Hi friends! This is probably a very obvious tip, but it took me 2 years of being completely disabled to realize it!

I feel like I can actually go to different rooms in my house now because I have a free hand for my cane and a glass of water, etc. I can put my laptop, phone, and charger in a shoulder bag so that, if my symptoms flare up after walking around, I can relax and watch youtube for a bit! :)
