Can visiting websites on my phone infect my wifi/router?
Can just visiting websites on my phone infect my wifi/network and as a result infect my laptop connected on the same wifi? For reference I was using the brave browser, entered an adult content website and checked the website on virus total (i am paranoid), only one security vendor detected the website as malicious and it was quttera, I then went to quttera's homepage to further inspect the website and quttera flagged two links on the website as being SEO spam. After that I looked for some extra help and thought that sophos test . com was a sophos url checker, and as usual also checked sophostest . com in virus total and this time two security vendors flagged the sophos website as malicious. Please, I am absurdly scared of malware/viruses and am going insane.
