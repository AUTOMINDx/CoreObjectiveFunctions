depression affecting cognition?
do you find that depression impairs your cognitive abilities? 

like at the moment, I'm finding it hard to think at all, articulate myself to my family let alone anyone. 

i feel like the depression / anxiety has eaten away at my personality, sense of self and learning abilities to a degree. .

does anyone relate to this??
