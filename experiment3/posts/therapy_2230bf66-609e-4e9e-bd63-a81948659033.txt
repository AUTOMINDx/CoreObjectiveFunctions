Burned out from life in general
“Suicide won’t change anything”, “Fake your happiness till you make it”. I am exhausted, everything is draining, it’s gotten to the point that sleeping itself has become exhausting which before was the only thing I looked forward to. Everything that brought me joy before just does not do the trick anymore. All the pleasure has been siphoned of every activity out so what is there left for me to do?  The guilt and sadness of feeling this way is fading away and I am leaving this here so I won’t forget that guilt and sadness, because when I do I don’t think there won’t be anything holding me back from ending it all. I’ve been questioning whether or not I have felt genuine happiness or if such a feeling even exists and if as a human I am even entitled to it.
