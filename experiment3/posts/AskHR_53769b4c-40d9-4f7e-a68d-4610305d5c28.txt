[NY] Did I mess up?
So ive been interviewing for a position that would be nothing short of life changing. I had 2 interviews and i know the last step of the process was to meet with the VP of the department for the third and final interview. My 2nd interview was a week ago, and this is right around the time HR said they would be selecting candidates for the final interview.

Anyway so today i sent HR a follow up email asking to gauge how the interview process was going. Reiterate how i feel the company and i are great fits for each other. Thank them for thier consideration thus far, and tell them im looking forward to hearing back from them soon.

Was sending that a mistake, do you think i came off as pushy. If the job wasnt such a huge step up id be far more nonchalant about it. Am i just overthinking?

UPDATE: about an hour after i sent the email i got a response back saying that they went with other candidates. Feeling pretty crushed right now, but on to the next right?
