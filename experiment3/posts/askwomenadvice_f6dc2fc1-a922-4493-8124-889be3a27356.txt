My partner last minute left me with her Mum? Am I overreacting or this is actually weird?
Hi All! Guy (26) here, my partner and I have been dating for several years (5+), live together (3+ years) and have a great (well most of the time) cat together. 

This weekend her mum is in town (she lives abroad and they only see each other a few times a year) and staying with us. We get along just fine but there's a language barrier and we don't speak the same language (although I started taking evening lessons to learn but am only a couple of years in, so can't have a meaningful conversation but can have basic conversations). Anyway her mum is here Friday to Monday and last minute she has decided to go drinks with some people from the gym (although didn't elaborate on any names or size of group etc). Didn't invite me (which is odd in the course of our relationship) and said she was going to go whatever I think. Normally I'm very relaxed about us doing things separately and we go out with friends separately and together but let each other know in advance. 

This (I think understandably) has me a little weirded out by the whole situation. I'm wondering 1) am I overreacting 2) what would you have done in a similar situation? 

Happy to give more details if anyone wants!
