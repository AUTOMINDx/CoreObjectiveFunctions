Getting afraid to go anywhere
I just got out of an abusive relationship which left me with severe PTSD and anxiety. I started avoiding places we went together and it turned into becoming basically a hermit. I've gained 50 pounds since February.


I used to go to raves in warehouses in middle of the night in downtown LA, looking for the map point with nothing more than my phone's GPS and my own two feet. I used to go on crazy adventures throughout the city at night, hang with friends, explore, etc. I used to have a great time.


I'm afraid to do anything now. Aside from taking the train to see my friend for a few days, I'm afraid to do much of anything. I'm planning on a trip to the bay area soon but I have no confidence in my decision making. I'm scared to go, I'm scared of being alone, I'm scared of variables outside my control, I'm scared I'm gonna get anxiety or panic attacks and I'm missing out on so much and I feel like I'm losing my youth by being so scared. I'm 25, I only have so long to do these things but I'm scared of fucking Walmart, let alone the fashion district at 4 am or a solo trip up the coast and I don't know what to do. I fear I'm becoming agoraphobic


I'm not sure what to do.
