I'm in therapy and starting to realise my childhood trauma might not be "not that bad" but actually just plain bad.
I have been in therapy for a couple of sessions, but only recently found the courage to say anything more specific than "my Mum got angry and did some things that weren't very nice." My therapist encouraged me to pick out some specific memories for us to dig into a bit more.

I didn't know where to start, so I basically picked at random, and told her the story of &gt;!my mum throwing me out the house at about 5 or 6 years old and telling me to "go find somewhere else to live".!&lt; and then said it was ok though because &gt;!she didn't hit me after she found out that I'd snuck back into the house.!&lt;I told her that I feel like it's not bad enough to warrant me feeling so upset about it. She told me "it's interesting you say that, and I think it's important for you to know that is one of the worst things anyone's ever told me".

I'm glad she said it because it's incredibly validating. I know a lot of therapists try to be stony faced and neutral about everything but I think it helped that she didn't do that in this instance. On the other hand, it's really hard to take in. I've never seen what happened to me as "proper abuse" but rather just a bit messed up. It's quite shocking to hear someone react so strongly to it.
