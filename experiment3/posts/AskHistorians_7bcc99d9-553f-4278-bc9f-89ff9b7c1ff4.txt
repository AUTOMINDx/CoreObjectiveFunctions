In fiction, the idea of a hidden city is not uncommon (Gondolin and Braavos, from LOTR's and ASOIAF's worlds respectively, for example), but is that based on any real historical city? Where does that idea even come from?
I am curious because the idea of hiding the location whole city doesn't seem viable, but maybe I am underestimating the size of the world and/or overestimating the spread of information and maps.

It is a bit of a different question, but if it is not based on historical ideas, what was the first work of fiction to feature such?
