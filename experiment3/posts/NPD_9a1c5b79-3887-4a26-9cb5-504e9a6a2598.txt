Does anyone else also hate people who are ungrateful when you've done something kind for them?
Basically I've noticed that a lot of people are very ungrateful when you go out of your way to be kind to them.

I don't get why I should want to be someone who cares about people who will screw you over after you've done so much for them and their family.

That makes zero sense to me.  Especially if the family is wealthy.  Like why do they need friendship from someone who isn't?  Especially if they also have NPD in their family?

They aren't going to validate my family and I, so why would I exactly care to have any kind of, "friendship," with them after having been very kind and caring about their pets?  Whom are the only ones I have fond memories of from that period of my life (and I know they are happy in heaven).

Basically I don't see why I would care to validate people who think I am someone who is ok to use.  They're useless to me anyways, so why even think that's a trait I have to work on?
