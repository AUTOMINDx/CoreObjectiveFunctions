What is the real science on Gender Equality among Hunter-Gatherers?
I had previously taken it for granted that most anthropologists seem to hold the view that nomadic, band-society Hunter-Gatherers (the default ‘natural state’ for humans) were very egalitarian and gender equal. In fact, a great number of my personal and political views were based on this fact. Examples of this seemingly common belief:

However, recently I came across a study that has cast doubt on my previously held position. This seems to be one of the only studies composed of data-driven meta-analysis of HG behavior. The results seem pretty disparaging towards describing HG as gender equal. It seems that the groups living in places where resources are scarce are quite sexist and dominant towards woman, and even the neutral groups are fairly negative by modern standards.

I’m unable to tell if they are using studies of existent (at the time, 1986) HG, or earlier accounts from the early 1900’s and before. Either way, I have a few thoughts on it myself, such as the groups studied with negative beliefs being 1 of 3 of conditions. Perhaps 1, these gender unequal groups are more disrupted by civilization than previously thought, and don’t represent ‘true’ or ‘pristine’ HG. 2, maybe they are indirectly disrupted by encroaching civilization by being forced off of their land and onto marginalized areas. Or 3, most damningly, perhaps this simply is the natural behavior of these groups who have chosen to live in resource scare areas and don’t mind the subsequent lifestyle changes.

All of these would simply be my amateurish guess at an explanation, and I’m hoping that someone could enlighten me on the current science of HG gender equality, as well as potentially give me a reason to invalidate or call into question this study, which otherwise would make me have to question and reconsider my beliefs about humans and our nature. I would also appreciate any more meta-analytical, data-driven HG studies concerning this topic.

Thanks to anyone taking the time to read and respond!
