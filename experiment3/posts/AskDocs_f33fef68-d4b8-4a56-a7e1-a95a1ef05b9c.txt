Diagnosed with myocarditis. Is it true that I’m now at an increased risk of dying?
28M, 6’2, 185 lbs, moderate drinker, nonsmoker, run 4-5 days a week, and was diagnosed with myocarditis following Pfizer booster shot. 

Long story short, I was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine almost 9 months ago and didn’t have any issues. I was even fortunate to have pretty much zero side effects from both doses. I received a booster shot (Pfizer again) and developed pretty bad chest pain on day 3. I went to the hospital, was diagnosed with myocarditis, and was admitted for two days (non-ICU). 

I was told that I have a mild case of myocarditis and need to follow up with a cardiologist before resuming physical activities (I’ve been training for a marathon which it seems I’m now going to miss which is a major bummer). Obviously the doctors don’t know if the booster caused the myocarditis, but said that it was possible. My antivaxxer brother has latched onto this and sent me numerous studies/articles about how people who have myocarditis are at an increased risk of dying, especially sudden cardiac death. 

I’m still glad that I got the booster since both of my parents are elderly and immunocompromised, but I’m really depressed about what happened to me. I suffer from health anxiety, so this has been unbearable and running has been my outlet for all of the negativity and stress in my life which is now coming to an end. 

Is it true that I’m now at an increased risk of dying? We obviously don’t know the long term effects of myocarditis from the vaccine, but do people who typically get myocarditis have an increased risk of death? Will I ever be able to run again?
