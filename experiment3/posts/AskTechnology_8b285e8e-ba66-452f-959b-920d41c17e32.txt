Is a mini air purifier effective at keeping a computer/ work station from becoming too dusty?
I am considering gifting my BF a tabletop air purifier to keep his work area from being too dusty. Does anyone have experience with this issue and will an air purifier be an effective solution to keep things somewhat manageable. I know one should be wiping and cleaning weekly but was hoping an air purifier could also help.
