How do I stop putting pressure on myself to always be productive?
I barely slept last night and had to take half the day off work so that I could get some more sleep. I feel so antsy and lazy for not being productive while I’m home. I even feel this way when I’m sick. Any tips on how to not always put pressure on myself to be productive?
