what types and amounts of non-homo Sapien DNA is present in humans?
I know that Europeans and Asians have Neanderthal DNA but I heard that some south Asians have   
a small amount of Homo Florences DNA. And that sub-Saharan Africans have Homo erectus DNA but I'm not sure about this because it's SO hard to find data on potential non-homo Sapien DNA in modern sub-Saharan Africans. Any help is appreciated because anyone can find data on Neanderthal DNA in humans but other data on non-homo Sapien lineage in humans is so darn esoteric.
