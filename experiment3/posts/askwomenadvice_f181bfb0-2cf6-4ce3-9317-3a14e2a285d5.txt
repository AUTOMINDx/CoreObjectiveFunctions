Ex getting married. Feeling horrible. Any advice would be appreciated
So my ex and I dated for 2 years. We broke up in 2019 but were roommates until 2020. We were both cordial/friendly with each other after the break up. Sometimes we would hook up but it meant nothing on either end. In 2020, he moved out and swiftly moved on. As did I. He moved on with a girl that was a source of conflict during the years that we dated. I felt bad about it when I found out they were dating, but it wasn’t too bad and I never brought it up. Fast forward to last month, he tells me they’re getting married. As the date of their wedding approaches, I feel more and more horrible about it. Is this normal? I’m in the happiest relationship of my life right now and I literally do not miss him or our relationship (which was pretty toxic on both ends). Idk why I feel so sad for the past version of me.. it’s like I’m mourning the loss of what could’ve been for a past version of me?? 


TLDR; Feeling horrible about my ex getting married to a girl that was a major reason for our breakup. In a happy and fulfilling relationship right now. Are my feelings normal?
