how can i make exercise a part of my life when i've been sedentary for years?
hi there, i need help. i rarely get out of the house, and i just straight up don't exercise. i'm easily fatigued and don't enjoy exercising so i haven't been able to make it a habit. i really need to, though; i want to lose weight and i do not meet standard exercise quotas.

please help! how can i make a habit of exercising when its never been a habit for me? thank you :(
