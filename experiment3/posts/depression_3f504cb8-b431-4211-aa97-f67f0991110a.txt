depression teeth
i’ve always been insecure about my teeth because they are kinda bad and the canines are super impacted. after years i’m going today to get some cavities filled, i go again in two weeks, then after the first of the year i get to meet with an orthodontist!!!! i’m absolutely terrified but i’m so excited!!
