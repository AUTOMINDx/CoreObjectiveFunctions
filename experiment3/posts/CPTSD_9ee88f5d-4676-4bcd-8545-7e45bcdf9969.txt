Happy Friday to everyone whose trauma doesn't allow them to celebrate/ enjoy Xmas!
As a child, I was afraid of Christmas. It was just a big drinking party for my family, and it always ended with yelling, violence, and other fun shit. 

So I kinda hate Xmas. 

And that is OK.

I hope your long weekend is enjoyable. Watch "Witcher" if you haven't yet and get some delicious food!
