Should I move in with my bf? Or wait for marriage? I’ve stayed with him for months before but this is different.
My bf (35) wants to move to another state in two weeks. Im 22 and this would be huge for me. Id be away from my mom. My family period. Me and him aren’t even married. I’d miss him so much if I didn’t go with him. Help. Advice needed please
