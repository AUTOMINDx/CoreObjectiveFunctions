Is there any evidence that psilocybin can harm the brain long term?
Hi there

It seems like there is so much data nowadays that psychedelics can help your brain -- increasing neuropathways, etc.

Is there any data that shows long-term damage to the brain, like other drugs (ie meth) do? At what point does micro dosing become harmful.. if at alll?
