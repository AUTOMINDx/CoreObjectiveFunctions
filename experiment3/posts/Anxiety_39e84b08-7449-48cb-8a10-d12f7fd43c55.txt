Coworkee tested positive for COVID, gave them rides all week long and they took a hit off of my vape pen
My coworker tested positive on the 20th, didnt say anything and I drove them to work on the 20th, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. 5 other people have tested positive at work too. Im vaccinated but my immune system still isn't so good because earlier this year I had colon cancer and had the tumor removed, but been fighting stomach issues since. 


I am terrified. My work offered tests and I get the results tomorrow, but I'm so anxious that I have it. I feel fine right now, aside from the general anxiety. No fever, no loss of smell/taste, no headaches, etc. But I'm so afraid right now, I am shaking. Why would someone go to work knowing they have COVID?? The disrespect on everyone else...
