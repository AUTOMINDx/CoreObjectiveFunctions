I told someone about my struggles
Like the title states, I told an extended family member about my dad and his health problems due to the drinking. I’m feeling pretty proud of myself for doing this, especially because I was taught that his family was ‘bad and untrustworthy.’ This narrative of my cousins and aunts and uncles all being bad people has been a reoccurring theme in my life. They were always ok with me but I was taught to not trust them. 

After many years of healing and recovery, I have recently realized that they were not the problem, he was always the problem. His drinking was the problem. His distrust of his family has isolated me from them and made this journey hard. I always got in trouble for telling them when he was in the hospital, or sick  etc. I now understand it has nothing to do with them and to do with his shame for ending up this way. 

 20 years of being in trouble for telling people things that happened in our life, has very severely isolated me. It’s just him and me and the step monster. My mother died over 20 years ago and she was my support person. He and the step monster are awful hateful drunks. The step monster can turn mean in a millisecond. I have been alone since my mom died. But today, I made the choice to tell someone about it. Go me! I’m choosing to step out of the shame.
