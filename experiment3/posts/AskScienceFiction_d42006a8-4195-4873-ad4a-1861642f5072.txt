[Spider-Man 2] Why did the bank have so many coins?
In preparation for No Way Home I’ve been rewatching the older movies. 

In Spider-Man 2 Doc Ock robs a bank and Spider-Man stops him. When Spidey first swings in Ock throws several large bags of golden coins at him. 

Doesn’t America use mostly paper money? Why are there so many large coins at a bank?
