Going to the movies the 17th! How's that for kicking Agoraphobia's metaphorical ass haha
Gonna see the new Spider-Man: No Way Home with my family, which means overcoming my Agoraphobia for a few hours. Already pre-planned the day. I'm nervous as all heck but I'm at the point in my life where Idc if I have a panic attack inside the theater, I'm watching this movie damnit lol
