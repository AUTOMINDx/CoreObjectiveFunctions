Anxiety with COVID
So i've suffered with anxiety for a few years now and i know the warning signs and i've become quite good at dealing with it but even though for the past 2 days i've felt ill and i kind of knew it was covid i didn't feel anxious at all, however, i got my PCR test today and sure enough it came back positive, now all the usual players are showing their head, mind spinning, hot flushes, heart thinking i'm in the middle of a marathon, i just can't shift it now though, i think because usually i know there is nothing phyiscally wrong with me i can trick myself, but now i know there is an i'm so scared at every little ache and pain, i usually focus on my breathing a lot when i'm having an attack but this time i'm scared it's the virus, anyone else had COVID and anxiety, how did you get through it, hoping someone can help :(.
