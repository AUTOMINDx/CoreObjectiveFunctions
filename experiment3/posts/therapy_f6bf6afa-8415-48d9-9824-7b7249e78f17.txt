I can’t forget the time my therapist lied to me.
Last time I visited her was in 2019, 
She diagnosed me with Depression and Anxiety but my mom kept saying i’m okay and everything.
One day my mom lashed out to me and said “Your therapist said she’s completely okay and she just wanted attention” 
It devastated me, For 4 years I thought I was depressed but I was just living in a lie, she even prescribed me medications that caused my weight gain, I had to take those damn pills everyday for 4 years even tho everyone said I was fine. I’ve wasted 4 years and gained so much weight as a result of her "diagnosis"

// I actually meant Psychiatrist not a therapist, I use the term therapist a lot so I forgot to edit it //


EDIT:
Thank you guys for all the comments,
I may have been gaslighted by my parents and I should stop blaming the psychiatrist, I feel like blaming strangers is easier than blaming someone you know, especially someone you trusted. 
I don’t know if my mom misinterpreted what the psychiatrist said or she’s just in denial that her child is mentally unwell. 
I’m not trusting what my parents say anymore, and i’m gonna try to move on and start focusing on myself rather than something that already happened, I’m just gonna distance myself from who’s hurting me. 
I’ve been emotionally abused so many times and it’s better for me to recover myself from what happened.
