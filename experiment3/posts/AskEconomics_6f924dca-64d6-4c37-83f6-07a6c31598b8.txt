Economic's focused YouTube channels/Podcosts that I should follow?
Hi guys, are there any YouTube channels or Podcasts that you would recommend to an Economics noob like myself? I really want to know everything about it :-). I know this is an extremely vague question, but I don't know how else to ask. Thanks for any replies guys!
