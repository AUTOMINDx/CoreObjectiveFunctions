1600s and Witch Trials in Europe
In my ignorance I am only really aware of the witch trials in America in the 1600s. Weâ€™re these going on in Europe at the same time? Earlier? Also was anyone who was superstitious or had lucky charms or dabbled in the mystic side of things considered a witch? How rampant was it?
