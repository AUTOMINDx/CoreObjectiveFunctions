Okay y'all let's hear your ideas for easy food to keep on hand for bad days
I posted yesterday asking for meal replacement shake options and got a huge response, you all have such great suggestions

So now let's see what else you guys keep on hand!

I like to keep single serve peanut butter as well as pretzels or crackers, I like pouches of applesauce and baby food, granola bars, nuts, anything I can keep on a shelf and just grab to eat
