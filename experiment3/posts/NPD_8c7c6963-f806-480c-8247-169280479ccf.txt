Narcissism is exhausting - battling the ego
Hear me out. As a self aware narcissist, I’m constantly battling my ego. Sometimes I want to say something that will make me look superior, but I know it will sound stupid and I’ll end up regretting it later, so I change my mind. But my ego is stubborn and I have the same urge to feel superior over and over. I wish I was naturally humble.
