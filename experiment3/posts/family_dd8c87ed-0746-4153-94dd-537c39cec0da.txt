Woman disrespected me at the store when I was with my kids.
I’m 22. I have 4 kids 3 girls aged 6,5, and 3 and a boy that’s 2. I had my first when I was 16 and then 17 and so on and so forth. When I was 15 finding out I’m going to be a dad I was basically inattentive to her mother and was horrible during her first pregnancy. I was just focused on school and myself. When she got here the month after my 16th birthday and I held her all my problems and selfishness washed away. Then our second was born and I went on the offensive. Got a job and everything. Was working after school, weekends, missed prom, missed dances, missed going out with my boys as I was more worried about being with my girls and making money to feed them. When I got out of school I got a second better paying job and then I found out that my girlfriend was expecting our third who was born 3 minutes before my 19th birthday. I’m still living at my mom’s house with 3 kids. I saved every dime I could and got my own place. Me and my ex broke up and I started dating someone new. 7 months into our relationship she tells me she’s pregnant and our son was born in October 2019. I’m writing this the day before Christmas 2021 and I’m going to propose tomorrow and hope she says yes. Now I’ve made some mistakes, having children so young and so many so young, being an inattentive father at times but I’m a damn good father.

Now today me and my girls were at the store they were in the shopping carts doing their thing with their tables and my phone watching their shows and this older white woman kept walking back and forth while we are minding our own business. She did a few times before I caught notice. She then proceeded to ask me how old I was with all those and if they were my sisters. I thought she was being nice and I said I’m 22 and these are my daughters and she got an ugly look on her face. She then said that I’m too young to have kids, I agree should’ve practiced safe sex. She then went on this whole spiel about how the young people are too focused on sex and all this and she then proceeded to say it looks like me and my kids are struggling, PS I’m black and my daughters mother is Hispanic/White my son’s mom is pure white, and I said yes they are struggling in a 5 bedroom house owned by their dad, with a 2 cars owned by their dad, IPads and toys up their ass so yes they are struggling. I then told her to get the F out of my face and leave me alone. That just really aggravated me to no end. I had to calm down before I moved on with my shopping.

I don’t know why people feel the need to downplay and disrespect me. Yes I’m a young man at 22. Yes I got 4 kids all under the age of 7 and yes I had unprotected sex in high school that led to two beautiful amazing smart kids, but do I deserve the disrespect? Hell no. I bust my ass for my kids everyday and I’m a damn good dad even though my baby mama and my girlfriend says I’m a “F’ing good dad”.

The disrespect out here from these Karen’s is real and uncalled for.

Edit: Gave her the ring this morning and she said yes!!!! Officially engaged 💍. Also she told me she’s 7 1/2 weeks pregnant so number 5 coming up. Best Christmas I’ve ever had.
