My (28m) stepmom said Red Lobster and Walmart is for poor people.
So my fiancée and I often ask for gift cards for Christmas. That way we can save up money and still have a good date night every once and awhile. We came home to visit family just before the holidays and they asked us where we wanted gift cards from. 

Now we have only been to Red Lobster once a few years back but we remember that we had a good experience there. So my fiancée suggested something like Walmart, Kroger, Cracker Barrel, Macdonald’s, or Red Lobster. Things like that. 

My step mom responded by saying we are going to places only “poor people” go to. It was the way she said it that annoyed me. Needless to say we didn’t like that comment very much. It wasn’t surprising though. My step mom is also my Dad’s second mistress he just happened to marry so its not like we hold her in high regard.
