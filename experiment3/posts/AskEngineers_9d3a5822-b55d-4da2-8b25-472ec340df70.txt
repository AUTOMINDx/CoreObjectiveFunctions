Licensed Electrician going back to school for Mechanical Engineering?
Im 31 years old and have been in the Electrical construction field for 11 years now. I want to go back to school for Mechanical Engineering. Being an electrician is a good job but I feel unsatisfied and I can accomplish more.

I have begun to become bored and uninterested in the job as it is very physically demanding on my body and very repetitive. I have tried to work for different companies and the majority are the same. 95% of the jobs we have to used VERY unsanitary restrooms and many of my coworkers are divorced, miserable, and under the influence of some sort drug. Not the environment I want to surround myself with.

I have lived well below my means and have acquired 2 rental properties, my personal home and 200 k in my retirement. I am married and do not have any children. 

I believe I want to pursue Mechanical Engineering because its more diversified in the Engineering field. 

Would having experience as an electrician help me in my career as a Mechanical Engineer?
