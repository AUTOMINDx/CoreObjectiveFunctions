why do my friendship with air sun tend to end up "gently fading away"?
im libra sun myself and i genuinely enjoy hanging out with aqua, gemini and libra peeps but i notice that my friendship of them tend to fade away without us fully emotionally realising it, even if were literally best friends. and sometimes it takes me a long while before i even realise it ended. is there an explanation for this?
