Do you ever refer to your college notes even after a long time ?
Hi guys, ECE student here (1st year). I had this question come to my mind, as I began taking notes, like do you reference them while working in a job, after graduating doing your diplomas ? If so, I will try my best to maintain my notes for long term storage and usage
