I have been in my current job for 5 yrs and some people reach out to me via LinkedIn offering jobs. How do I ask them (directly but politely) for the base salary? I just don't want to go through the interview &amp; then back out because the salary is below my expectation. How do you message them back?
I don't have much time to run in circles but I am also not exposed to the job seeking world for a long time. How do you respectfully ask, "Before I go through all that process, may I know how much is the base salary for that job you are inviting me to apply to?" I want to sound a no non-sense person but not tacky or arrogant.
