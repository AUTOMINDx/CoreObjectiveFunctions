I've decided I'm killing myself before the year ends.
I’ve fucked it up in life, man. Wasted so much of my 20s, went to a shitty school for a degree with no future, I was reckless, thought I was smart, thought I was unique. I was just dumb. Now I’m 28, unemployed, living with my parents, zero social life, zero interest in anything… I’m just existing. My friends gave up on me, I’ve disappointed them. My parents gave up on me, they don’t even kick me out of their house, they just stop wasting time caring. I’m done, it’s too late. Even if I wanted to restart my life, I’d still have a shitty degree. Even if I wanted to restart my life, they’d be 100 more guys younger than me and more talented at their jobs. Before COVID I thought I had all the time in the world. Now I know I’m just a pathetic piece of shit, everyone went back to their lives months ago, and I’m still living like it’s 2020. Every now and then I wake up with 3 new ideas for projects and before the day ends I just feel awful because I know I have no chance. I’m done. I’m already planning my goodbyes. I feel sad but mostly just relieved.
