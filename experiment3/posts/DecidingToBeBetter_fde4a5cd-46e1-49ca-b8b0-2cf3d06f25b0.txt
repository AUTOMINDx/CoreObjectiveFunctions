I left behind all the relationships that did me harm…totally alone, but that’s okay
I’m finally making some progress. This semester of college, I cut ties with my extremely abusive ex of three years. In addition, I said goodbye to all of “our” (his) friends that gaslit me, and some fairweathered friends of mine who have always been jealous of my success and talked poorly about me behind my back. 

Quite the clean slate! I’m almost completely on my own now, and I’m slowly adjusting to not having my phone buzz. But that’s okay, because I deleted social media two weeks ago and I’m spending a lot more time reading.

My relationship did devastating damage on my energy levels and self esteem. Those two areas are going to have to be where I fight hardest for a change. I’m prone to just laying down all day feeling shitty about myself, but I’m letting life pass me by. I definitely have depression so I think I’m going to start some kind of medication, and find a new doctor.

I’m scared, lonely, and unsure. But I can’t lie that the simplicity and peace that comes with being alone is nice! Especially compared to the screaming fits, blame games, and cold shoulders I’ve dealt with for years. I’m really ready to live for myself now. Just a year or two ago, I was close to losing my life. I’m thankful I’m still here.
