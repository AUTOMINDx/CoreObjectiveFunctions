What I want for Christmas is a new job
23M stuck at a job I hate more than anything in the world. It’s accounting at an extremely small company (I have a BBA in accounting, graduated in 2020). I’ve applied  to so many other jobs, nothing. I don’t know what to do, I’ve edited my resume to the job description and sent cover letters, I’ve even taken SQL and Python courses to be more in line for the data analytics roles I’m more interested in. Please, how do I get a new job ASAP? I feel like I’m running out of time. I’m going to go insane if I need to be at my current job any longer.
