Ex fiance is suing me to force me to sell our home
Let me start out by saying, I really hope I don't get attacked again. I came here looking for support. I know I have made stupid choices and I know I deserve to be punished. However, my kids do not deserve to be hurt..

My now ex fiance and I bought our home in September. Last month he suddenly decided he did not want a big family or me and left. Today I received a letter from an attorney stating that I have to either refinance to get him off the mortgage or I need to sell the house. He says he can make me sell it. 

I have three children who live here. And I am 32 weeks pregnant with our twins. He says he needs off the mortgage so HE can get a house for our twins. He say she does not care if I have a place for them to live. 

I have obtained an attorney but she says I may be forced to sell. I don't make enough money on my own to get approved for a mortgage. Nor would I qualify for a rental that would be big enough even if rooms were shared. 

I agreed to pay the entire mortgage and get a second job once the twins are born. I can afford the house by myself already but things would just be tight til I got a second job. So he does not have to pay a dime. 

Has anyone else ever dealt with this kind of situation? Can I do anything to keep the house?? I don't want my kids to be uprooted again. I have learned my lesson and I am staying single until the kids are grown and moved out. I just want them to have a peaceful and stable life and I don't want them to be hurt anymore because of my stupidity.
