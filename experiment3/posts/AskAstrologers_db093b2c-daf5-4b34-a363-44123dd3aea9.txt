Considering that 7th house is also the house of open enemies. Why is it seen as so powerful and positive for relationships?
The worst relationships Iâ€™ve had were with people who had strong 7th house synastry with me. The open enemy thing really showed out. I know of course not everybody has similar experiences but why is a house that can be interpreted as the house of relationships and open enemies seen as the best house for synastry?
