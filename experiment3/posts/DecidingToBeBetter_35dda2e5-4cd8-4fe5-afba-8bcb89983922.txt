Here's What I Noticed About The Self-Improvement Community
**1. A lot of people have the victim mentality** When someone asks a question, and people respond and actually give him a solution he's like "Oh no but I can't do that, you don't know what it's like to be me....."

**2. Most answers you'll find are not practical at all**

When someone asks a question, I'll often read stuff like "change the way you think" or some other reallypassive answer.

**3. A lot of people seek validation**

Questins like "Is it normal to......." or "Should I ....." are very popular. People are often asking if what they're doing is considered "normal" for others.

**4. They overthink a lot**

A lot of questions that I find are simply overthinking. Basically, some people think they have a problem when in fact, the problem is that they think way too much.

**5. Most of the community likes to feel good instead of actually improving**

That's why quotes are really popular. They give you the feeling thaty you're much wiser and more mature when in fact, you didn't do anything practical.

That's my take on the topic. What do you think ?
