Does this sound like you too?
Daily headaches. Constantly feeling like I’m “not really looking at things”. Vision blurry. Panic attacks start because I feel like what I’m seeing isn’t real then I start to panic that I’m having a stroke or something. Depth perception issues. 

I always feel like I’m living in a dreamland. You?
