Is it common for adults to have no friends?
I had a friendship group in school, but after going to different universities we all grew apart. At university I only made one really good friend who I keep in contact with over social media, although she lives a long way away now. 

Currently, I have an amazing fiancé and a great job, however all the other people at work are old and I wouldn’t call them friends. I would say I have no friendship group at all.

How do people even make friends these days? I find myself very jealous of my fiancé who has a group of friends he games with, and it just hit me, am I just going to live the rest of my life without friends? 

Anyone else struggle with making friends as an adult?
