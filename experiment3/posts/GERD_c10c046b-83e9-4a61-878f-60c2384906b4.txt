Feeling kinda embarrassed about my moods ever since starting AWD
I recently started the acid watchers diet and it’s been really hard, having to change my entire lifestyle has been really affecting me mentally. I feel embarrassed though because the past few days I’ve been with family, and I have had a few freak outs I feel bad about. It is just incredibly hard to go out to eat with them, and I feel embarrassed asking the restaurant to accommodate me. Eating out gives me mad anxiety now. I feel bad cause I know my family is just trying to help, and I know I’ve been a broken record about it, and I can tell I’ve been annoying my friends and family with the complaints…. I’m only on my seventh day so it’s super fresh for me… I of course keep apologizing and thanking the people in my life for listening and trying to help…. But I do feel like they think I may be a little dramatic or annoying. I know I’ll get used to it, but it’s hard. And I know nobody in life will hold it against me, but I do still feel bad. The hanger does not help. I’m trying hard to remind myself that I’m going through a hard change right now, so of course I’m not going to be perfect.

Anyways, just wanted to see if anyone has felt the same way… I’m so thankful for finding an online community to talk to, it really helps :)
