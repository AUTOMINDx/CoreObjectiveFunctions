Did people in Medieval Europe really practice "Genital Parenting"
According to "Growing Up Sexually World Reference Atlas", a secondary source which I haven't been able to find evaluations of, historical data points towards the possibility that: "Genital soothing may well have been widespread in Medieval Europe". In other words, that adults would stimulate the genitalia of children, as a way of calming or controlling them ([Janssen, D. F. (2002/10) "Growing Up Sexually. Volume I: World Reference Atlas. Interim report. Amsterdam, The Netherlands - Europe, Historical Generalia"](http://www.sexarchive.info/GESUND/ARCHIV/GUS/HISTORYCHHS.HTM)).  


To back this up, the archive references a lot of sources that I haven't taken the time to go through, and which seem hard for me to estimate the reliability of. I've noticed that one of the main sources is written by Lloyd Demause, whose work I generally view skeptically. To me, the original claim seems almost too sensational to be taken seriously, which is partly why I suspect it of being a fabrication.   


Is there any truth to the proposition?
