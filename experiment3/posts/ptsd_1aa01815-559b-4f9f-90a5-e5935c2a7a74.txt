Ketamine therapy at field trip health
Quick update - ketamine therapy has changed my life and I no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for ptsd after six sessions at Field Trip Health.
I’m so happy this drug got approved in Canada for the treatment of depression and ptsd because honestly it just gave my brain the opportunity to engage in neuroplasticity to interrupt the scary and negative thought patterns that were intruding on my every day life.
Highly recommend because it lets you revisit traumatic memories in a relaxed mental state where you can still feel sad but where your sympathetic nervous system can’t enable panic mode so you can process the memories and acknowledge them and just move on instead of having them get stuck on repeat and cause chaos
