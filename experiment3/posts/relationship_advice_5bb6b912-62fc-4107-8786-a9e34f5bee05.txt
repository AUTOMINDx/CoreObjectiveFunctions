My (26m) partner (29f) is scaring me
Last night after drinking my partner woke me up in the middle of the night by choking me. She had my arms pinned down by her knees and held both hands around my throat seriously squeezing hard. I had to free my arms and loosen her grip to breathe. She tried again later with a pillow and with a headlock. 

She asked me if I wanted to be murdered. I said no. She said “well too bad, don’t fall asleep”. 

She has also threatened me with a knife before, thrown sharp objects that hit my eye and face, and cut my skin with her nails. She hits me all the time in face and groin. I have been bruised all over. I never know when to expect it because she acts normal until she does it. I never fight back or resist because I’m scared she will use it against me. When I try to record with video she stops and pretends like she is hurt. 

What do I do? We have a kid together and it’s only escalating. I called her parents a couple years ago after the knife incident and they told me to be more careful not to make her angry. Everytime she hurts me it’s always my fault for making her angry. After hurting me she tends to be very loving and affectionate. It hurts my brain. 

I tried telling my own mom and grandma, they want me to put up with it for the kid. 

No one cares what’s happening to me and I feel so alone.    I don’t feel safe.
