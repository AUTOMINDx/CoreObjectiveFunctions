What are some decent paying jobs that require little social interaction with others??
I really don't want to deal with people all the time. I don't want to deal with so much drama and toxic behavior at work. I am willing to work hard. What are some jobs that require little social interaction with others but pay really well up to $100k?? I am willing to put in the work to get to that salary. I can work in a team but not with customers or outsiders all the time.

Edit : I am okay with working with a team but not constantly like sales, which is the opposite of what I am looking for. I just want something that isn't constantly dealing with people and so much social interaction. Basically jobs for introverts is what I am looking for.

EDIT 2: I am okay with working with coworkers obviously. It would be okay if I had little interaction with them but if I had to constantly work with them, that's fine. What I meant to say was that I didn't want to work with customers
