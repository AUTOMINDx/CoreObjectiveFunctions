Can depression cause physical exhaustion?

For the past 8 months I have been dealing with extreme fatigue. On my days off from work I can sleep all day and still feel tired. Or I will go to bed at a decent time around 8pm and wake up at 6am and still feel like I need hours more of sleep.  

I have had depression/anxiety (doctor diagnosed) since I was a teenager I am not currently on any medication for it. 

I had anemia in the past but the doctor said I did not have it anymore. That was 2 years ago. I do feel lethargic like I did when I had anemia but not sure if it could be that or just my mental health.
