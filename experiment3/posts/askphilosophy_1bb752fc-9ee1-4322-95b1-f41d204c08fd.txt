Have analytic and continental philosophers ever come to the same (or similar) conclusions from largely different methods?
I ask this question acknowledging the weakness of the terms analytic and continental, which kind of leads quite well into my question. 

I don’t know much about the philosophy of language. But I do know there’s much contention between the two groups at points, like the debate between Derrida and Searle. However, I recently read Rorty’s Contingency, irony, and solidarity, and the outline of Donaldson’s contingency—itself leading to claims about language and philosophical ideas (1) not leading to objective truth and (2) being a succession of metaphors that people use to better explain their experiences with reality—seems to me similar to a kind of deconstruction, in which language is insufficient to demonstrate any one objective, non-contradictory meaning. Rorty also constantly cites what he calls the Hegel-Derrida tradition, the Ironist tradition, which led me to my question in the title. Maybe when I say analytic philosophers it’s limited to just Rorty or his circle, especially since I’ve read (in AskPhilosophy) that Rorty misreads Donaldson. 

I’m not well-read enough to be completely sure in my premises—But IF certain aspects of the contingency or the insufficiency of language are present in analytic philosophy, are these also major concepts in continental philosophy, and, if so, do analytic and continental philosophers ever share conclusions from different methods or viewpoints?
