How do people make therapy work when working a M-F 9-5 job?
I’ve always worked retail/similar jobs while being in school/while taking a break from school (there were a lot of breaks lol) so I’ve always had a flexible schedule. I typically had one weekday off/one weekend day off. So making it to therapy during normal business hours was never a problem. 

I finally finished college, honestly years later but who’s counting. I also secured a job that is your typical Monday-Friday, 9-5, but it is fully remote. 

My therapist and I have a standing 1 PM Wednesday appt. I also live about 25 mins from her office, so about 2 hours a therapy day is dedicated to it. 

My question is, how do you have a regular session while working typical working hours? I don’t want to tell a new job I have a standing appt every week. While it is remote, I would have the opportunity to go remote w my therapist but remote therapy DOES NOT work for me. So the question just is, how do I make this work come January? I’m really not in the space to stop therapy/start over. While I’m excited about my job,
I’m worried about this.
