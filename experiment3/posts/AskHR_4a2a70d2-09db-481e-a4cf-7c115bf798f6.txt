[NJ] What actions are stalking/harassment?
Hello,

So I work at a local box truck company. I have a supervisor with a personal vendetta against me following me around out on the road, watching my every move and basically writing me up for anything. Just yesterday, he ran a red light just to stay on my tail.

I can not do my job properly like this and I'm worried for my safety. What can I do?
