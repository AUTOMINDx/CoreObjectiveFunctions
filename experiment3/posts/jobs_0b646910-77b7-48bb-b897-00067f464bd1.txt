I asked the owner what the pay rate of the company is during the end of a job shadow and he said "I will not discuss pay until you are serious about joining the company". Is this a red flag ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©?
I just did a job shadow for a sound/ media company I would like to work for . When I asked the owner what the pay rate is at the company, he said "I won't discuss pay until I know your serious about joining the company".

 Dispite the covid pandemic, the owner says that the company has been really busy since the pendemic and they are making alot of money . This company is also an hour away from my house so I also need to consider the rising gas prices into the equation

Is this a red flag or is this a normal response ?


Edit 

The owner is kinda old (mid to late 50s). He owned the company since the 90s so that might explain his old school mentality on this.
