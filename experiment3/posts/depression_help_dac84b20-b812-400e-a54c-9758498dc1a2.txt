I think I’m slowly starving to death
Hello. First of all, I don’t know why I am posting this. I have no hope of help or understanding anymore.
I am letting myself starve slowly. I have little to no appetite and no motivation whatsoever to cook for myself. Once a chocolate addict and a foodie and keen cook, I now have no craving for it whatsoever. Even when I do get hungry, it’s like I don’t allow myself to eat and nothing appeals to me. I am tiny to start with but now I am under 50kg, having lost around 5 to 6 kg in the last year alone. I’ve also gone from 25% body fat to around 15%. 
Everytime I eat, I feel bloated or just get pain in my stomach. Diarrhoea is almost every day.
I have been suffering from depression for decades but this is the very first time in my life that I have lost my appetite like this.
I basically live a double life where I pretend everything is fine to people (even those that know of my struggle) but the second I am alone, the tears and the pain come out. 
I can’t stand the way I am anymore. It gets worse as I get older. I think I might die in the next few years if I don’t change. 
I’ve been to my GP but they don’t care. All they can offer is more meds or CBT. I feel like nobody cares or wants to help me for real. I keep being told there is help out there but no offence, the help is a box-ticking exercise to make it look like they’re doing something. I have had tons of therapy and been on various medication and now in my 40s I am worse than I have ever been and I think about suicide everyday. 
I don’t know what I am expecting to happen here. I just don’t know know.
