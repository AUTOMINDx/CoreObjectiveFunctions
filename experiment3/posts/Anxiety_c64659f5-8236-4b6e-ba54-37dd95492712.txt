Do you ever feel like you’re lying about your anxiety/depression or that you’re being dramatic?
Sometimes I feel like my anxiety isn’t real, that I actually don’t have anxiety, and that I’m lying to everybody. I read posts on here and feel like I’m just a fraud and I’m being dramatic because everyone has it worse. Even though everyday I feel like I’m suffering endlessly and at the brink of mental collapse.
