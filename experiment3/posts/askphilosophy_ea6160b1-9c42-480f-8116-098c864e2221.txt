Non-Western, Non-Indo-Chinese Philosophy
I am trying to develop a list of readings to better understand the philosophical underpinnings of sociopolitical organization of cultures that largely maintained their histories through oral tradition. Because of this, I know almost all texts are secondhand, and it's easy for an author to slip in bias. 

I am looking for high-quality descriptions of life for groups that are not connected to the cultural developments of Eurasia (or if so, ones which deviate from the dominant philosophical lineage). Anything from pre-colonial North and South America and Africa (excluding Egyptian, but including the Horn cultures), pre-Buddhist South Asia, and pre-colonial Oceania are all welcome. 

Some works that I have already identified are Primitive Man as Philosopher and The Savage Mind (commentary on these are welcome as well). 

I'm happy to answer any questions, and thank you!
