Money Vs City ?
Hello

I am 27 year old immigrant in France, I just finished college and I got 2 job proposition (Medical physics)

1). Dunkerque (north of France), It pays 3600 euros/month after taxes, 4 days of work ( I got Tuesday off), however, I have been told it is a shity place, not good for a 27 year old man. (private hospital)

2) Orl√©ans (center of France), it pays 2954 euros/month after taxes, 5 days of work, It is not the dream city, but it is still better then the first city. (public hospital)

Here I come to you for advice, should I take the better paying job or should I go for the larger city ?

What you should know about me : I lack social skills, and it starts to feel as a burden, if you came to me 2-3 years earlier, I would have told you I can live alone for the rest of my life, but I was wrong, I need friends I guess.

Thank you
