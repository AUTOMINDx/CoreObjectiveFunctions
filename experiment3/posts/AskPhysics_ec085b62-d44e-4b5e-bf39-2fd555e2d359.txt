I apologize if this is stupid. But what exactly is "space"?
Not like space as in outer space. But the physical concept of space. What seperates "space" from nothingness? I ask this because I have always been kind of confused when I read that the universe is expanding or when it's shape is discussed. Wouldn't the universe have to expand into "space" that's already there? I can see a concept of space that it doesn't, if "space" is defined as the minimum three dimensional volume that entails matter. But that just seems too simple to me, especially when you take into account spacetime as a concept.
