My boss’s boss wants me to work exclusively with him on a daily basis. Good or bad?
I’m in the mechanical engineering field, and take projects for clients. Basically my boss’s boss, the (team leader of around 30 people including me) has told me that he wants to pull me away from my current manager and for me to work directly with him on a day to day basis to help alleviate his workload. Prior to this, I have been putting out fires on projects that he has not had time to take on himself.

My question is, do you see this as a good change or is this a potential concerning change? I feel that I do really good work, but I am a huge perfectionist and naturally I wonder if this change could be a form of micromanagement? Please tell me your thoughts. Thanks.
