Hey everyone, I'm back with an update for you! It's maybe a little anticlimactic, but a good one nonetheless.

Before I dive in I want to give some background. I was already caught because apparently my coworkers read r/legaladvice (so much for my alt, hi guys!) so I'm a little less paranoid now lol. 

My dept head only joined a few months ago after my old boss left to totally change careers and become a middle school teacher and has been a pretty hands off leader, so I didn't really know her at all before this. 

Anywayyyyyy... 

First thing this morning I scheduled time to chat with HR and he immediately slacked me asking if it was about the gifts from my boss, and when I said yes he told me he's taking care of it and just sit tight. So I sat tight for the next half hour until he asked if I was free to chat.

He told me that he got multiple reports about it and that discrimination of any kind isn't going to be tolerated, so that's good. But apparently my boss was already planning on leaving before EOY and in the process of transitioning out, so there wasn't much that could be done besides move the end date up.

So I guess she just didn't gaf anymore because she knew she was leaving? Idk. But whatever, we work in a really small and gossipy industry so jokes probably on her.

So that's that! Problem solved and I like work again. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice and support, and to those of you who commented with hateful shit, you suck.
