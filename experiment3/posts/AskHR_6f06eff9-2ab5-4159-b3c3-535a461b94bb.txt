[MI] How would you word on a PIP a manager “disappearing” during their shift?
I have a manager that is currently not meeting expectations, and I am currently in the process of writing a 90-day performance improvement plan. One of the issues is that their direct reports state the manager is never available or can be found when needed. This has been addressed in the past with no improvement so I want to include it on the PIP. Would anyone be able to share some insight to how exactly they would write that on how to improve? It’s the one thing I’m stuck on. If it helps, this is a retail environment. Thank you!
