Why is my laptop performing poorly?
My laptop is Dell Inspiron 5402 with the ff specs:  
CPU: Intel 1135g7  
GPU: Nvidia GEForce MX330  
12 GB ram  
and runs league and valorant at about 60fps on low settings. 

My friend's laptop is  HP Laptop 14s-dk1505AU  
CPU: Ryzen 3 3250U  
GPU: AMD Radeon Graphics, which afaik is integrated  
8GB ram  
and I noticed that league and valorant run better on his device averaging about 100+fps on both games running on low settings. I know that league and valorant are games that are not too demanding on a device but does anyone know why my device performing so poorly when it has arguably better specs?
