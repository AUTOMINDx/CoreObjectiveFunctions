Parents, have you ever had your children take care of you in times of your emotional distress?
I was reading a webtoon about a boy who committed suicide due to family expectation, academic pressure, fake friends, &amp; having to be perfect all the time. His family was obviously devastated but no one is more devastated than the mother.

She was severely depressed. Every day &amp; night, she would cry &amp; any time she sees a child, she'll break down. So much so that her youngest son was asked to take care of her. The only thing is, he's young &amp; in no position of caring for an adult but his mom needed him. To comfort her. To tell her everything's alright. To make her happy &amp; never worry. While this young boy was tending her, he shoved all his emotions down &amp; kept a happy face for her at all times. He never had a chance to come to terms with his big brother's death &amp; never had a chance to express grief.

And so, I want to know if there's any parents out there who rely on their children, even young ones, to care for them when in distress.
