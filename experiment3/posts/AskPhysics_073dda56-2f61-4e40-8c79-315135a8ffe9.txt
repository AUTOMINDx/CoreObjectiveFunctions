How to - scientific reasoning?
So I'm in the middle of my bachelor's in astronomy. I realize that i I'm good at learning the theory, practicing problems, writing in general. But when it comes to performing experiments, writing conclusions based on models we test, and analyzing why we get the results we got....i seem to not be able to put theory and lab work together to get accurate conclusions. Maybe I'm not able to explain this properly, but i feel like I'm lacking in the scientific questioning and analysis aspect. 

Any tips/ advice on how to improve in this area? Besides practicing more, is there a different way to approach labs and theory to get better at scientific reasoning?
