Not considered for promotion. What now?
My boss (Senior Director of Marketing) left about a month and a half ago. During my first meeting with the CEO I asked to be considered for his position. I am the director of marketing, have 12 years experience and an MBA from a top 25 school. I found out today that they are planning on replacing him with someone from outside the company who only has 9 years experience and a BA.

I feel awkward about all of it. I'm disappointed that they didn't even consider me. On the one hand, I've only been there for 8 months, but on the other hand I have tons of broad experience and know our market well as I used to be a customer. Part of me thinks I should stay and see how this turns out---until we started transitioning, which was right after another colleague left, this was my favorite job. Part of me thinks I should focus on leaving since it's pretty clear they don't see my value.
