Is there any meaningful difference between a chiefdom and a monarchy?
As far as I can tell, chiefs and kings seem to share almost all the same characteristics: authority over a region or people, for life, which passes down to their heir. But in popular usage, we almost always use chief to refer to the leader of a small pre-industrial group, and kings to refer to a leader of a larger, more "advanced" group.

Is there an academic distinction between these two terms? In my mind, it seems fairly Eurocentrically biased to refer to certain societies as tribal chiefdoms and others as kingdoms based on arbitrary categories. Why, for example, are the leaders of pre-Columbian societies like the Haudenosaunee tribes often called chiefs even if they had authority over regions and groups of comparable size to European monarchies?
