Should I (23M) tell a girl (25F) I saw for three dates that it’s her looks that are making me end it?
So I have gone on three dates with a girl from Bumble because she’s nice to me and we had interests in common. Since the beginning I wasn’t that much attracted to her physique, but I wanted to go on dates to see if there would be a spark that would make it worth it to pursue dating her even if I don’t find her very attractive.

That said, today I went on the third date and at the end of it, combined with the other two dates, I made up my mind that I didn’t want to go further with her. I proceeded to tell her because I thought it was better in person than over text. 

She kept pressuring me to know what it was that was problematic. I kept telling her that we just didn’t go along well enough for me to be still interested.

My question is: should I have been honest and told her that her looks were the reason? 

I don’t see the point in hurting her with such a statement, and frankly, I’m not Brad Pitt, therefore it could happen to me someday and it would hurt a lot to hear.
