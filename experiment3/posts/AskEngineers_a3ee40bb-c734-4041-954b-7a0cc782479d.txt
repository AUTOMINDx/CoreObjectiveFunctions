How do deal with my coworker “mansplaining” everything I say and taking credit for my progress in my projects.
Mansplaining is a good description but I don’t think he does it because I’m a female I think he just does it because he feels entitled and would do it to anyone. So I guess he’s just ‘splaining..

The problem is every time I tell him something to teach him or share info with him he starts his response with “no that’s not right” But goes on to repeat the exact same thing I said right back to me. Which somehow makes it seem like it was originally his idea. 

I can’t tell if he sees it and does it on purpose because he feels like he can explain it better to me, or if he doesn’t see it at all and genuinely thinks I’m wrong. This spills into the tasks that I am assigned with him. We are figuring out new software and I am progressing much faster than he is but when it comes to updating our management on our progress, basically my progress is “our progress” but his progress is his progress. Unfortunately because I’m newer my boss tends to ask him for an update and not me. 

I’m a little insecure because I’m relatively new (3 months)  I don’t want to step on anyone’s toes but I also need him to stop because I take pride in my work and get really happy when I learn something on my own. I don’t know how to address this with him without sounding aggressive so I’m hoping someone who works in a corporate environment can give me some advice. 

Thank you!!
