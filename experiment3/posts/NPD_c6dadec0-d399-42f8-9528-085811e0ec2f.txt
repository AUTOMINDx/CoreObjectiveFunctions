What's stopping you from blowing your brains out?
It's a serious question. I ask myself it all the time, as a fellow NPD. Why do we even keep living? I'm bored with life and have no hope for my future. I can't even look more than 5 years into the future without having a mini panic attack. What keeps yall still going?
