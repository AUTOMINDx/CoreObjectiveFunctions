23M. I'm in Bali on my own. In the last 12 hours I've had fully liquid diarrhoea about 15 times, and now just fainted. What do I do?
Diarhoea has been 100% liquid. Literally over 15 times in 12 hours, to the extent I'm confused where it's all coming from..

On about the 15th time, I started sweating, my body started going numb, my vision started going blurry and I heard screaching in my ear, had disorientation and collapsed against the wall (this is just fainting, right?)

As it was happening I was getting quite worried and considered phoning my hotel's reception calling for medical help, but I feel stable now. 

I haven't eaten from anywhere that would be associated with food poisoning, though maybe I haven't eaten enough.

What could this be? Is it a fairly common thing (severe diarrhoea then fainting)? Should I be concerned? Please advise - thank you
