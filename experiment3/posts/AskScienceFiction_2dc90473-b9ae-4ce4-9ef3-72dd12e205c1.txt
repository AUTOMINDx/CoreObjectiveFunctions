[Marvel/MCU] Kingpin is often more than willing to fight Spider-Man in an encounter, despite the power difference. But how much more powerful does a hero have to be, before Kingpin refuses to fight them?
And/Or better yet, abide by any demands that they would have. Like, if Thor came down from the sky, and demanded 1000 Lbs of a brand of pudding, that only Kingpin can get him, would he acquiese to such demands?
