Have you ever been a victim of the classic Egyptian romance scam?
Ok reddit, so my friend went on a trip to Egypt last month and made out with a local guy she met there. Instead of it just being a regular travel hookup (we've all been there, amirite?), they've been talking on whatsapp every day since she's been home and he tells her me loves her and sends her poetry every morning... It's a lot.

So of course he's asked her for money several times and told her a whole sob story about how broke his whole family is, how his parents are dying but he can't afford medical bills, and how he lost his business because of covid....basically everything that could ever go wrong. She tells me she has not given him any money but I don't know if I believe her because she tells him she loves him back and continues to talk to him every day. 

To me, this is so obviously a scam. He is crying poor and trying to exploit my friend for money. I have to wonder if this has happened to anyone else and what was done about it. I don't know how to help my friend and I want to make sure he can't do this to anyone else.
