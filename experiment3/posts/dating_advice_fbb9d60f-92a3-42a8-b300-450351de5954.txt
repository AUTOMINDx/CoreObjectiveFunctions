So looks don’t matter? Not in my experience.
So disclaimer I used to be fat. I was 27.4% body fat and weighed 211 lbs. I’m 6’0 so that’s almost 50 pounds higher than a healthy weight. I used online dating and I got the rare match I was excited about but never had consistent luck. So I decided to quit dating and work on myself.

Fast forward to over 1 year later I decide to try Hinge again. I have new photos of me and I’m currently 175lbs and 13% bodyfat.

Holy fuck the difference is night and day. Women match me, message me first, give me their number and even propose dates.

So in my experience, this is a bullshit lie people say to spare others. Looks absolutely do matter. Maybe they don’t to the odd person but for the majority it matters.
