Coworker coughed on me [CA]
GM won’t acknowledge that it happened other than “planning to” write a company email to say “don’t come in if you don’t feel well.” Head of Security told GM that the sick employee should have been sent home by a manager and GM got offended saying “the employee should have known better than to come in sick, that’s not on the managers to do.” Manager said he can’t do anything unless the GM tells him otherwise.

Coworker clocked in looking and sounding like, well, death. Pale, eye bags, clammy, phlegm in the throat, coughing and sneezing, the whole shebang. Visibly looking rough enough that at least 3 other coworkers and Head of Security told her that she should go home.

The incident: Standing within 2ft of me while maintaining eye contact, no mask on. She just open mouthed coughs on me. I know it wasn’t intentional/malicious though. She went home a few hours later, after she let the managers know she wasn’t feeling well.

I would like to bring this to HR‘s attention, but would like to know the right way of going about it. Please let me know if this is just me being in my feelings about this, I don’t want to waste our cool HR persons time.
