Is there definitive evidence that Roman gladiatorial combat wasn't actually a scripted sport like today's prowrestling? (I'm aware this sounds like a troll question, hear me out)
I assume there are no sources that outright "expose" it, but it wouldn't be surprising if they were just protecting the kayfabe. 

I can see different reasons gladiator combat could make it into sources, but I doubt anyone was writing with the intent of passing on the idea of how it's done to people who will live after the fall of Rome. In their own day, if the crowds weren't aware of it being fake, then it would be more lucrative to keep the secret, and on the other hand, if they knew, I doubt people were learning about the art of it from the books - people getting into it in any form would be shown the ropes, not read about it. (I suppose dirt sheets and such from the time period would be possible?)

Mainly concerning deaths, I can see why you wouldn't want a great gladiator to die - maybe they just fake died and retired? A guy who's a good draw could later be brought back as a different character or train others - that sounds more financially smart than letting top guys in their prime die.

P.s. I'm not trying to push this as a conspiracy theory ("What the Senate doesn't want you to KNOW about Spartacus!") or anything. It would be cool to get exact sources that would make me go "yep, this theory's dead"
