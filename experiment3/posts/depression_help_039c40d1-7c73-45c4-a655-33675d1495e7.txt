Therapy brought something up and I don’t know how to deal. Help please?
So, I was talking to my therapist and something I didn’t expect came up, it looks likely that I was abused as a child by a teacher. Not sexually, sorta physically but more along the lines of psychological and emotional abuse. 

I was beaten in school by teachers but that was normal I guess? It’s an era thing maybe? The thing that came up though is that teachers, 2 specifically would torment me with how shit I was at life and school, they’d make me stand in front of the class and humiliate me by calling me dumb, stupid, illiterate (which makes no fucking sense), they’d exclude me from lessons because I’d ask questions or not be able to keep up, they’ve told my parents I’m mentally “retarded” and need to be put down (something that my dad and mom dealt with but it hurt hearing that). I was a high school dropout who was diagnosed with ADHD and a few learning disabilities. I graduated high school and University at 31. I was on a high till this shit came up and I can’t express anything but anger. I’m struggling here and I just don’t know how to deal with this. After therapy it’s like more and more of these memories keep popping up. I talk about it but I don’t feel any relief, I journal and break pencils... I’m angry, sad, I just want relief and for it to go away. Anyone feel the same? How do i deal with this?
