Rapid random pictures in head when you close your eyes?
When ever I feel REALLY out of it and I close my eyes to try to go to bed my mind just shows the most random constantly moving images in my head. Like it’ll just be completely random nonsense. It’s like when you think of random things about your day while going to sleep except you have no control over what your mind is displaying and it makes 0 sense while changing rapidly. This has been getting more intense recently and I’m wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this.
