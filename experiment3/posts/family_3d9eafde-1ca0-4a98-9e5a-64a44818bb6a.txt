Am I (26F) overreacting?
I'm sorry if this will be a very long post, I do not know how TLDR (As written in rules) is meant or supposed to look like, so I wanted to apologize right here for it.

So I (26F) am a single child. My mother (43F) got me with 17. I never got to meet my father, nor did he ever make the effort to contact me, I don't even think he remembers me being his child at all.

When I was 11, my stepfather (48M) entered my life. I did not feel jealous, I didn't feel angry, but I was happy for my mom that she has found someone she loves.

I think that was not the same case for my stepfather. He kept giving me weird vibes. He made me feel like he hates me alot and that his wish would be that I am gone, kind of as if I was a bother to him as soon as he moved in with us.

I tried to built up a connection to him. I kept asking him what sports he likes, what music he listens to and if he would like to do some activity together. He never answered me and told me he is not my father and that he never will be close to that. He purposefully left me out of many activities. 

So yesterday, 9. December, I went to visit my mom. Everything was fine, we talked alot. He came home and was very mad seeing me there. He asked my mom why she did not ask him if it is alright for him that I come over to their place. He went on for atleast 30 minutes, my mom did not say a word and I was so mad I started yelling at him.

I told him about how it hurted me that he never accepted me, that he always left me out, that he said alot of hurtful words towards me and that all I wanted was just a father figure in my life. It did seem to get him very mad and he told me to leave instantly and that I should not show up at all anymore.

Now, my question is: 

Did I overreact by yelling at him and telling him everything he did was hurting me, or was it built up emotions that I was allowed to let out after so many years? :(
