Did anyone else always think they would die young?
From a young age I always remember thinking I wouldn’t make it to the next milestone in life: junior high, freshman year of high school, getting a drivers license, going to college, turning 21. I always had a feeling I would die before those things happen. 

I don’t know where this thought came from but I’m curious if any other CEN survivors felt the same.
