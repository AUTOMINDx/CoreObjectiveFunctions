My younger brother harasses me.
I'm the oldest out of three children, not specifying my age or my siblings' age either.

My brother, 2 years younger than me, always touches me in places whenever I fall asleep next to him. Of course I kick him away and tell him to stop afterwards, even told my parents about it. Mom said she experiences the same thing whenever he sleeps next to her too.

They don't do anything about it. I'm having feelings I don't want towards my brother. What do i do?

UPDATE: He's a bitch.

Whenever I deny something he wants to do, he gets all upset and guilt trips me. This can be something simple from me saying "I hate you", or if I push him. I hate him.
