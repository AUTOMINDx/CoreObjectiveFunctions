Can chills from PTSD make you feel cold when you actually aren't? (CW: Discussion of being triggered and symptoms)
I'm sorry if this isn't warranting a trigger warning. I put it there just to be safe. I don't wanna trigger anybody.

A few minutes ago, I watched a webcomic show on Youtube, and I was feeling fine. However, in one clip, they joked about something related to my trauma, and next thing I know, I'm freezing cold, tense and shaking pretty hard.

I'm confused cuz whether I'm triggered or not, if I'm cold, I shake pretty hard and my body tenses up so much it hurts. I don't have to be triggered for this to be true. But I wasn't feeling overly cold like this a few minutes ago. I know chills are a thing with PTSD. Yes, the involuntary motion you do when you get that random chill is kinda frequent when I am triggered. I'm having a hard time differentiating between PTSD chills and cold air in my home as my landlord refuses to fix the drafts here, and I'm in the northern hem where winter is right around the corner.  


Is it possible that maybe I'm fine temperature-wise but because of that clip I watched, I'm just triggered?  


Also: Yes, I'm in therapy, yes, I'm on meds that I'm about to resume tomorrow. Help is much appreciated.
