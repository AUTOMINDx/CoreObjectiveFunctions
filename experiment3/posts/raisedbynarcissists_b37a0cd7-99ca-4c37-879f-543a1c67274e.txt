36 and still very afraid of my parents
It's sad that I'm a grown ass woman who lives 6 hours away from her Nparents and completely financially independent of them but is **STILL** afraid of them. I'm afraid of the yelling and the guilt tripping. And maybe, I'm afraid of losing them and being labeled the worst daughter ever,  even though they continue to be shitty parents.

They expect me to drag my daughter up there for Christmas this year, even though they didn't come to visit me on my birthday, nor did they even send a card. I am planning on just staying home and letting my child have the best Christmas ever. Then I'm gonna have to break the news to NM and she will rage and tantrum. 

But it's time I stop being afraid of them and start doing whatever is best for my family.
