How were the Great Lakes formed?
This one has been bouncing around my head for a long time.  I've lived within an hour of a Great Lake for 20/24yrs of my life, and I still don't understand how they came to be.  I've googled it, and all the sites say is "the Great Lakes were formed by the melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last ice age".  I just can't seem to wrap my head around how it all fits together - why is Erie so shallow?  Why is Superior so deep?  Why the disparity between the two, and how did the melting ice sheet cause it?

Thank you in advance, I really apprecite it!
