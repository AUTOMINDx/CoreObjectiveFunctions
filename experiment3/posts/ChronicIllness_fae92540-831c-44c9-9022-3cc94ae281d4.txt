Chronic diahrrhea please help!!!
My son who is in his early 20s has had chronic diahrrhea for three years. He was recently diagnosed with gastroparesis. He has had every medical test possible and they have a food allergy test scheduled as a last resort to stop his debilitating diahrrhea.  He hasn't been able to work and can barely leave the house due to fear of having an accident if he can't find a bathroom. He has had steroids, antibiotics, a regime of Reglan and nothing has helped. The doctors are throwing the towel in on this and saying there is nothing else they can do. I can't and won't believe that he has to live this way for the rest of his life. He is depressed and sad all of the time and I can't bear to see him this way. Please, if you know something that will help, please share it with me so I can try and help him. Thank you in advance ‚ù§
