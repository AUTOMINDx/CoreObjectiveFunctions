Anyone out there with both PTSD and autism and/ or adhd?
How is your experience? Have you found differences from other people with PTSD? What approach have you been taking to manage both your PTSD and your other diagnosis?


Edit: Thanks everyone for all your responses. Both my husband and I have had a read of them and it is nice to know there are other people out there who understand. I wish you all the best of luck with your journey through this and also a happy holidays. Internet hugs and support.
