A common theory to explain DPDR is that it's our mind trying to "protect" us from horrors. I don't buy that.
I do believe that "horrors" are what instigate this disorder, but I have a very hard time believing that it's our mind trying to protect us. Rather, I'm convinced that it's our minds trying to get us to kill ourselves, like we are a failed experiment and it's time to wrap things up. That sounds dramatic and I don't have concrete proof for that. It just *feels* like what dpdr is trying to do, because that's the end result, isn't it? The end result is just constant misery and disorientation. It certainly doesn't protect us from *shit*. Negative emotions are some of the only things I can feel. I've felt loneliness and heartbreak and hopelessness so strongly during this decade of dpdr. My dad died earlier this year and I lost hair from how much grief I felt. My heart felt poisoned. If dpdr is trying to help, it's doing an awful, awful job at it. It literally makes things 10 times worse because you still feel miserable, but you can't even fight back.
