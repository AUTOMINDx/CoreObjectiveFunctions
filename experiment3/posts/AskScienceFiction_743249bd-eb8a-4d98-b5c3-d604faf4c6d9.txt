[Spider-Man 1 (Raimi)] Maybe I didn't understand it as a kid, but was Green Goblin really implying he was going to rape MJ, when he was fighting Peter?
I guess in hindsight he did seem to be creeping on her, especially in that dinner scene where Norman comes over, but it seems really weird to single her out. 

Was he REALLY intending to do it, or just fuck with Peter's emotions further?
