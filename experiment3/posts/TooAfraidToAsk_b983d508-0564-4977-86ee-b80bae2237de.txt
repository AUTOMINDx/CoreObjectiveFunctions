Why are people surprised that Joe Biden is not extending student loan relief?
I think pretty much every single president, Democrat and republican, have lied during their campaign in order to be elected. 

Why all the surprise over Joe Biden? Lol 

Every presidents lies in order to get elected in my opinion.
