Christmas with an alcoholic parent
I hate Christmas with a burning passion, over indulging in alcohol is normalised and , in turn, an incentive to drink even more than usual. At least, this is the case for my dad as he orders over 10 bottles of wine which, i’m sure, will be gone before a week. 
Does anybody else feel this way too? It feels incredibly lonely, especially seeing my friends posting their vibrant and family filled christmas parties and gatherings and dinners online as I spend xmas day in my living room alone as my dads upstairs, drunk and asleep by 3pm. I’m 16, so I’m confined to my own home at Christmas time, no other place to go to spend the day. It really sucks :(I’d rather be at school
