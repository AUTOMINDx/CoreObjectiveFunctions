My mom is a cheater (she cheated on my dad) and thinks I don't know.
My mom cheated on my dad with a guy in his mid thirties despite being in her early 40's. 
I've moved on from it but she keeps lecturing me every conversation.

I wanted to show her this report I wrote for school asking for her feedback. She says it's okay then proceeds to randomly lecture me to be careful of what my choices are because chances are it's wrong or bad and will affect her reputation, image and just herself in general.

I find this extremely hypocritical because she keeps saying it to me all the time despite her constantly being unfaithful in her marriage. 
She even introduced me to the guys she's dated as "friends". She also assumes I don't know she's cheating. And I don't know how to tell her I know right now because we kinda live together and it'll become awkward.
