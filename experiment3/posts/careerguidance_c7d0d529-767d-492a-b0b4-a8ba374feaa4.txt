Does studying a master's part-time look lazy or bad?
Hey all. Just wanted to know if studying a maths master's part time whilst working a job in say retail looks bad? Just wondering if a future employer would look down on this and think I'm lazy. I want to study part-time because full-time was too stressful for me for my undergraduate.
