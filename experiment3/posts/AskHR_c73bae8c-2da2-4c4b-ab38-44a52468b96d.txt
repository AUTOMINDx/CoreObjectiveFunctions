[IN] My gf has a miscarriage. Is it okay that her boss has brought this up multiple times?
Not sure if this is the right place or not and if not, could someone nicely share what is if you know?

Title honestly.. he had a review at her job. Her boss mentioned the miscarriage she had for the 2nd time now and says it’s affecting her attitude at the workplace which my gf says isn’t true. This wasn’t from an HR person or a therapist or counselor. 

Her job performance has ever been affected. She just goes in and does her job. Makes way less mistakes than everyone else in her department.


On top of that, a few weeks ago she had a meeting with her showing her some handwritten list of things she needs to do to “get back on track”. No official form or conditions was given with it. No copy was given to her. Yet today she was told she is not getting a bonus or a raise because she failed to do these things within 30 days. (We went on vacation a week after this first meeting). 

This is a privately owned company that has been featured on shows like QVC and GMA. Probably 50 or less employees. 

I’m just looking for advice here. She’s really upset and am curious if any of this sounds wrong.
