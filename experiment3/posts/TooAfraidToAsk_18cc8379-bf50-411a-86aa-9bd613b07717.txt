Girls - House party peeing?
Had an interesting conversation the other day and turns out a fair few of my female friends have gone and peed in empty rooms at house parties because the bathroom queue was too long (not to mention they were pretty drunk ğŸ˜†)

I was shocked that so many of them had done, is this actually that common?

Definitely never hosting a house party again ğŸ˜‚

Edit: Oh damn this blew up way more than I expected! Thanks to everyone for their comments, as expected I just have absolute trash for friends ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
