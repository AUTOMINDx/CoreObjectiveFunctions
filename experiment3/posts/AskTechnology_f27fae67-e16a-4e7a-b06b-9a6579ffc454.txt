For those who work on social and media website algorithms for post/watch suggestions, how do you think the human brain works?
My question is for those who work at Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, etc, how do you think humans consume media? Why am I inundated with tons of the videos of the same kind when I only wanted to watch one?
