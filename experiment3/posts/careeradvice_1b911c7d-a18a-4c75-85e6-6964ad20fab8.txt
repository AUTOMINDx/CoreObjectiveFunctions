Company is mistakingly paying me an extra $7000/year
I am supposed to get $500/month for medical expenses since I defered our medical coverage (Still on paents medical) but they have been giving it to me with every paycheck and we get payed bi weekly. That means I am getting an extra 7k/year.

Should I say somehting or just keep my mouth shit and thank my luck? To be clear, I have no moral objection to not saying anything. I would only say somethign if I could potentially get in trouble later for not saying anything.
