I stopped myself from self harming today.
No one was at home. I felt like punching the metal locker till the skin on my knuckles came off. I even took off the ring that they gave me for good luck so that it wouldn't be damaged. They had asked me not to take it off, ever. Well I did, to punch the locker. Wearing it had left an imprint on my finger. But then my cat saw me hovering intentionally in the corner. She walked up to me and meowed. I was unable to get out of bed till then and she wanted affection. So I gave it to her. Put the ring back on. I thought, my friend would be really worried if he noticed my knuckles had gotten even more damaged the next time we met. I told myself, how does self harming help in any way? Instead, do something that helps you, like taking the anti depressant on time. Go. So I spent some more time with the cat until the others came home and there was no risk of me trying something stupid. This is a win to me. Maybe I'll call up my friend in a bit and ask him to talk about something random for 5 minutes as a distraction. I can't share this to anyone, I could to him, but he'd worry. He's been asking me to write down my troubles as a coping mechanism, since I like writing. So here we are, reddit stranger. Here's my short story of deciding to be better.

Edit: I brushed way earlier than I usually do. Today is definitely a win.
