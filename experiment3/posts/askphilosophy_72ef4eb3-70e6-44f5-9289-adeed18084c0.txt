Do you know of any philosophers who grew to regret or disagree with their early work?
I find it interesting that people can feel so certain in their beliefs earlier in life, even to the point of writing in-depth books about it, while at the same time continuing, themselves, to grow and learn with more and more experience and wisdom as they age. Surely, at some point, some of these wise men must have grown to change their beliefs? Do you know of any such people?
