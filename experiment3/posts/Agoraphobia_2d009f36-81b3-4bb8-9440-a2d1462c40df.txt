I went!
We played in the snow for a bit, made a snowman AND walked to the pharmacy! I had that weird "Oh no will I faint now?" feeling. Probably because of anxiety and hitting my vape right before I walked in. The walk back felt similar for a split second and I chuckled to myself. Now I'm inside warming up, about to go back out and play. So proud of myself!
