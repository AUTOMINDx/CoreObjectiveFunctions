Which unexpected items help you manage depression?
Christmas is coming up and I'm lucky enough to have a couple of people asking me what I want. And it got me thinking that all I really want is to be happy. But since I can't do that the next best thing is items that help manage my depression. So far I have a few things that help. The obvious: pill organiser, daily planner, food containers (so I can cook multiple meals at once when I have the energy), weighted blanket and art supplies. But I'm wondering if there are any other items expected or unexpected that help you?
