Why don’t people put urinals in their house?
As a guy, I’ve always thought that if I build my own house I’ll put a urinal in it. It’s so much more convenient to pee in. I feel like girls would also appreciate it because the toilet would be less messy. It can’t be that much more expensive and it actually saves water! I’m going to start a new trend!

Just to clarify I would keep a regular toilet as well.
