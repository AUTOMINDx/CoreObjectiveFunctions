I Came out to my mom
Hi everyone, 
this is my first time posting so if i make any mistake please correct me
So i am pansexual and i had only told a few of my close and supportive friends, my sister and her friends till now, but a few days ago i thought about coming out to my mother, i knew she wouldn't be very negative or anything as i have given hints before, like whenever any one said "we will find the best groom for our princess (yes, me)" i often replied, "or a bride" and my mom heard and didn't make any comments, but i was still very scared, but yesterday i gathered up some courage and told her, this is how our conversation went : 
me: mom, do you what's gay? 
mom: yeah, girls who like girls
me: ya, do u know about bi, pan, poly?
mom: umm..... no
me: pan's feel attraction towards everyone regardless of their gender, more like attraction on basis of someone's personality and looks than thinking about their gender
me: so.... i am pansexual
mom: ahh so u like humans on basis of their character
me: yupp, pretty much
(now i m from india, n mostly after getting married, couples often live with the groom's parents)
mom: so if u ever want get married to a girl, ask her to come and live with us, i won't send u anywhere, we three will live here, at my house
me: (deeply touched) u-u don't have any problem?
mom: why would i have any problem? you love who you love, as if i can change a damn thing



and guys that was literally the sweetest thing my mom has ever said to me, i was sooo god damn happy with her reaction, i just wanted to share it! thank you'll for reading, and if u r trying to come out, all the very best, you can do it, just make sure u r safe.
