Cleaning advice :)
What are your tips for low effort cleaning? Cleaning takes so many spoons when I'm constantly tired and my joints hurt so I was looking for ways to take some physical labor out of the tasks. I got a light weight cordless vaccum that has been a huge help but I'm still wearing myself out doing laundry or attempting to clean the bathroom. My main problem is bending down bc it hurts my joints and I get really dizzy (POTS). So picking up laundry from the floor sucks but cleaning my tub is impossible. I know its probably bad for the environment but I'm looking for some stronger cleaning solutions so I'm not on my knees scrubbing the bottom of my tub. something i could put on and let it sit and rinse away or at least do less vigorous scrubbing. I'm very interested in hearing how your cleaning has evolved while living with chronic illness. Any advice is welcome &lt;3
