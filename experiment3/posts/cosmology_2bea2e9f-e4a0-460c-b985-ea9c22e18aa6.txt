(my first post here ) an idea (if possible)
Simulating Universes.

They would:

\-sometimes create child universes

\-have different rates/factors for the 4 fundamental forces, dark matter and energy

\-would move

\-would expand at different rates.

\-things those have been theorized about the early ages of universe being different at all the universes.

\-universes inside universes?

Universes looking like bubbles?

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? additional ideas? Other stuff those could  be different in different "bubbles"?
