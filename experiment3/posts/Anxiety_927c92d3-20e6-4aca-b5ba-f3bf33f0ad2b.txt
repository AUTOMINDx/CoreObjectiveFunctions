Anyone downplay their symptoms bc they’re becoming normalised but that could just mean more people have anxiety than they think?
EDIT: I meant invalidate 

For example, if u think about it, phone calls aren’t normally an anxiety inducing situation but for a lot of people (me included), phone calls can induce an array of physical symptoms to the point where I start shaking. Just because lots of people experience it doesn’t mean it’s normal, especially since there are lots of people who don’t have overwhelming anxiety around everyday things.
