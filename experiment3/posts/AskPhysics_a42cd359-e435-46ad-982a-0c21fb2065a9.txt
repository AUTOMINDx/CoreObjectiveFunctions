Could there be more fundamental forces we cannot detect? What would that mean for the search of a unified theory?
I was wondering, just like we cannot directly detect dark energy and dark matter, could there be one or more fundamental forces we canÂ´t see in action? 

If so, without being able to detect them, could a unified theory even be achievable?
