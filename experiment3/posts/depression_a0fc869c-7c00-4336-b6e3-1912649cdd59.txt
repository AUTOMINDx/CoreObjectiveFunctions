Being born poor is making my life hell
Iam a 19 year old from india and I was born into poverty. My mother had nothing when I was born and we have barely anything now. I want to study further but I cant even afford the cheapest college . My mother works 9to6 and so do I.
Even with both of us working we can barely make it, with two younger siblings I don't know what an I gonna do. I feel depressed all the time , can't focus on anything. Why did this happen to me . I just want to have normal life.
