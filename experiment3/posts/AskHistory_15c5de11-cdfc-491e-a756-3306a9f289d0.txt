Why were the Nazis so relatively lenient towards black Germans in the Third Reich?
It is a miracle that black Germans were not systematically targeted to be sent to concentration camps and exterminated. Unfortunately, Jews/Slavs/Romas/Gays/Jehovah's Witnesses/etc. were not so lucky.

A few black Germans were sent to concentration camps and/or forcibly sterilized, but the vast, vast, vast majority of the 25,000 or so [black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_black_people_in_Nazi_Germany) Germans were not. There were no attempts by the Nazis to systematically exterminate black people in the Reich whatsoever.

**In addition, this leniency can't be explained by the small number of black people living in the Reich at that time.** For example, there were approximately a mere 20,000 [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_in_Nazi_Germany) in Nazi Germany, and unlike Black Germans, they *were* systematically sent to concentration camps and/or killed.

It's ironic that the Nazis were so eager to exterminate different groups of primarily white-skinned people like Jews, Slavs, Soviets, Poles, and Jehovah's Witnesses while being so relatively lenient towards groups much further away from their "Aryan" ideal, like black and Middle Eastern Germans.

Can anyone please explain why the Nazis were so relatively lenient on black Germans given their ideology? Is there a specific reason for this?
