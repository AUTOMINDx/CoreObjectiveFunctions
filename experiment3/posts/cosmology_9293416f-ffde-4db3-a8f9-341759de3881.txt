What happens to light at “the edge” of the universe before first light (emergence of cmb)
Basically title…but, we normally use the analogy of the early universe being a “hot, dense soup”.  I’m wondering how to think of light that exists at the outer boundary of the universe before first light. 

Totally cool with the idea that light isn’t escaping the universe because it keeps interacting with matter (until the universe expands enough that the universe becomes not dense enough to trap the light.) But the hot soup analogy makes me think of a *bright* chunk of mass in space. Where would the light go in that scenario and how does it compare to the cmb?

Perhaps there isn’t “the edge of the universe” and this is where the hot soup analogy fails? 


Bonus: if anyone has good sources for learning about baryon acoustic oscillations plz send me link.
