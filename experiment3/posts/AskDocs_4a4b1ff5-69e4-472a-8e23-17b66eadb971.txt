I am very thirsty even after drinking 5-6 liters of water. Should I limit my water intake to a normal level even though I'm thirsty? Is this level of thirst cause for concern? (17M)
Recently I have started drinking more and more water per day and it has reached a point where I easily drink 5-6 liters of water in a day. At this point I usually realize that drinking more water could be dangerous and I stop drinking, but the thirst continues and it is hard to sleep because of it.

Should I limit my water intake to a normal level of lets say max 3.5 liters per day even though I'm thirsty? Is this level of thirst cause for concern?

I'm currently using creatine, which I know can increase water retention, but I'm pretty sure it shouldn't increase thirst by this much. I'm around 180, weigh around 60kg and am not currently using any medication.
