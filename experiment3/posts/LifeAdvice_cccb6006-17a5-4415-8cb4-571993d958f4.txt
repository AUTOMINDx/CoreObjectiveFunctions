Is it right for my dad to charge me a 100 for rent every month
So my dad got me my first job and I'm 17 so I still go to school but he said that I have to give him a 100 a month but I been told he shouldn't do that even though I agreed and rn I'm regretting it like yeah I should pay after high school
