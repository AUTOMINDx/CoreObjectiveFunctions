scared to leave college.
hi, i'm a senior in college and i'm absolutely terrified to graduate. i'm genuinely scared for the rest of my life and fear that the world just gets smaller after college, in the sense that i may lose the friends, network, and lifestyle that i've created for myself during college. as an introvert, i fear being entirely alone and isolated, and having feelings of fomo while watching other people i know thrive and succeed. does anyone have any advice for or any positive/comforting anecdotes from navigating this time themselves?
