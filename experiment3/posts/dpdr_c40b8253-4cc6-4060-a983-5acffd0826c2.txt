Stop all the generic help
I think everyone that is in this subreddit needs to stop looking for fast cures and all this stuff that truly doesn’t exist, I think you need to dig deep and find out what’s causing ur anxiety and dp and understand it, all of this meditation and stuff is not gonna give u full time relief you need to find yourself and realize a lot about yourself that u may not really like
