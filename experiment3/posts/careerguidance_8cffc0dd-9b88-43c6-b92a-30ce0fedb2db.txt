Is it going to make me look bad if I have to reschedule an interview with a hiring manager?
I'm supposed to have an interview with a hiring manager in just a few days. However, my boss just texted me that we might have a meeting on the day of my interview. So I might have to reschedule my interview to maybe the 1st or 2nd week of the new year. Will this make me look bad in front of the hiring manager? 

I will be sending out an email to my hiring manager explaining what happened. I'm just worried that she'll assume that I forgot about the meeting.
