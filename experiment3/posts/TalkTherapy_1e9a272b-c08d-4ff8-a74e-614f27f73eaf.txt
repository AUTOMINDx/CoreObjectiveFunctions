My therapist cancelled but I had a lot I wanted to discuss before Christmas break
So I was due for a Zoom Counselling/Therapy session today but my Therapist has caught the dreaded virus and cancelled because they felt unwell. I totally respect and understand that and I hope they feel better soon. However, my last session was cancelled due to clashing commitments ... I haven't had a session since 22 November and my next isn't until 10 January. I'm having a lot of issues with work and my personal life and was really counting on today's session to be able to talk freely. Now it's been cancelled, I don't know what to do with all my pent up emotions.
