Overheard my gf(31f) saying she wouldnt have dated me 5 years ago because I am too stable
We got together 6 months ago and its honestly been going great. I know its still honeymoon phase but we got along like a house on fire. Anyways I was hanging out at her place yesterday when her sister arrived. Now I know her sister has recently went through a break up so I gave them some space to talk and went to take a nap. When I woke up I could hear that they were still talking and her sister was emotional so I stayed put on the bed. At one point her sister was saying that she really liked her relationship with me as it was drama free and she wished she had a relationship like that. Hearing that my gf said to her that at her (sister is 27) age gf would never have dated me but with age her priorities have changed now and she values safety and stability which I provide and for which she is really thankful.

Now I dont know what to think of here Reddit. Was it a compliment or did she just call me boring? Any ideas?
