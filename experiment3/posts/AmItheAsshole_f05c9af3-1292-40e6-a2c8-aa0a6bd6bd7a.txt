AITA for telling my Boyfriend he's not allowed to bring Peanuts into my home in any form?
So I am a 24 year old woman and my boyfriend who is 27 have begun to get more serious and he often spends the night at my flat (apartment for you Americans) as I have one myself while he has roommates, he has begun to leave clothes here as it makes sense to have some and i've even cleared out a shelf in my fridge and pantry for him to leave his favourite foods/snacks. 

That is where this issue came up however, I noticed he is quite fond of peanuts and I have a severe peanut allergy, I am worried about cross contamination in case he cooks with them one night or leaves crumbs etc out that I don't notice it could be quite bad for me.

I told him I didn't want Peanuts in the flat because of my allergies and told him I have no issue with him continuing to eat them but he'll have to do so at his own place or when out during the day and not bring any back, he has told me i'm being unreasonable and if they're in his section of things there is no risk to me as he's careful and wouldn't leave any out but it only takes one forgetful moment to be bad for me...He took this to mean I do not trust him and he thinks i'm being unreasonable, am I? I just feel he isn't taking this seriously at all...
