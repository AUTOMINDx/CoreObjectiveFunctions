The holidays get harder every year.
I wish so badly and so often that I had a functioning family. I wish I had a home to go to for Christmas. I wish I had traditions and memories to share. How can you replace a lifetime to date without it? I have a great SO, loving in-laws, and caring friends — but it isn’t the same as the ‘real deal’.
