I relapsed again
I have been thinking about killing myself a lot now recently and it's becoming a constant struggle. I hardly feel hungry anymore and the world seems so dull. I try to do the best i can to keep myself alive, at least till after Christmas but nothing is working. I don't even feel sad anymore, i just feel numb. It's the worst feeling. I would much rather feel sad than feel nothing at all, because I know what to do when im sad. When I feel nothing, i can't seem to stop feeling that way. I'm honestly so fucking scared for my life. I don't want to die. I really don't. It's just nothing feels real anymore. I don't know how much longer I'll be able to put up a fight. I'm really trying my hardest.
