My father chose alcohol over me
I just, fuck u dad, fuck you for letting me watch you getting worst. Fuck you for completely ghosting me and then calling me on my birthday and acting how it’s everything normal and making jokes. I needed you. My mom needed you. Fuck you for letting my seeing you with married woman and mother of my friend when I was 7. Fuck you letting my all day alone without food when I was 8 and you coming home drunk. I loved you so much, I needed you, but you didn’t ever even seen me, you were to busy pretending you are alright. Making me feel stupid and small, scared to even call you because it could be Tuesday morning and you could be drunk. Fuck you, your neighbor told my how u drove drunk, how you pointed a fucking gun at people in the bar. And that you tried AS someones wife and her husband had to punch you. I’m your only child and you don’t care about how much you hurt me. I’m adult now and I see someone I don’t wanna be. You really are just like your mom…
