Company requires me to pay $7000 if I quit - I am actively applying, so can I negotiate a buyout?
I'm pretty unhappy with my job for several reasons. I signed a form accepting a rotational program, however if I leave within 2 years of working for the company I owe the company the sum of travel accommodations and signing bonuses equaling \~$7K. Is it possible to negotiate buyouts or higher signing bonuses with other jobs in order to leave my current company? Would this be a bad financial decision even if I loathe my day to day? For reference I have an engineering degree and have only been working out of college for 8 months.

My other option would be to stay with the company and participate in my second rotation (which would be a new role, non-engineering) starting in 7 months.
