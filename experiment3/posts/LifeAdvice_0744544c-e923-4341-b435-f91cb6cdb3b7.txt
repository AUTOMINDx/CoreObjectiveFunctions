Im lazy or something
I (22m) want to be great . I know i have it in me . Im good at everything i do to a nearly professional level . I had aspirations of being a boxer and have been in with top fighters &amp; boxers . But its in spurts . Im on the edge of giving up . I had gotten me a 70k a year job but im just letting it fall apart and about to lose it . It seems like i go hard for a few months , then lose all motivation seemingly out of nowhere then ill have a terrible few months where ill spend all my money and let everything fall apart . Im self destructive . Ive gone in and been diagnosed with bipolar 2 , depression , &amp; psychological trauma . I dont want to be like this . I want to harness that energy i have when im on my A game . When im on my A game im unparalleled in my work ethic and focus . Id even say im obsessive about the smallest details of my work . Im also scared of being uncomfortable now . Im inconsistant . Im 22 im running out of time . I dont even know whyat im asking for . Help ? How do i control my mind instead of it controlling me ?
