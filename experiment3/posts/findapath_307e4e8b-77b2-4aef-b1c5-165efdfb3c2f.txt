Please help me, I’m at my wits end.
I need advice/suggestions on what kind of career I should seek. I cannot afford much college and I’m lost. I used to manage an art studio and really enjoyed it. I also used to tutor kids grades K-5th and shadowed specials needs children (I’ve moved to a different town that’s why I quit). I loved working with the kids, but I’m just not sure what to do. Where do I go next? Anything is appreciated.
