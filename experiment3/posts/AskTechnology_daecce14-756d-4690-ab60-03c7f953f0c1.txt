Please help! Lost photos from Christmas Eve (syncing to Google Photos)
English is not my first languge, so sorry for the mistakes. I hope it's ok to ask for help here from pros. r/techsupport is closed and I'm really desperate.

I decided to start properly using google photos today and sort my photos out. The photos on my phone (Samsung Galaxy A50) had been backed up to some extent to google photos on my google account no. 1 - I, however, decided to use account no. 2 where I have unlimited space. So I first deleted all the photos in google photos app (account no.1) and then set the synchonization to account no.2, where my photos slowly started appearing after that. I then chose th option to "clear space" on my account no.2 google photos, hoping that all the photos that had been synced up until that point would get deleted from my Samsung phone gallery. I repeated this process until all my photos had been uploaded to Google Photos and disappeared from my phone.

**Or so I thought. Some of my recent photos, including those from Christmas Eve, are nowhere to be found. I've looked everywhere - they're not in the Samsung gallery trash, they're neither archived nor in the bin in neither of my Google Photos accounts... I've even tried connecting my phone to the computer and searching for them in the systemic folders, and a few data recovery apps like PhoneRescue, Dumpster etc. (which I am not sure are working properly though, because they say that my phone has not been 'rooted', but I'm not really sure how to do it or whether it's safe). These apps could recover lots of my photos, nothing, however, after around 22nd December or so (the most important of which are those Christmas Eve photos to me, I don't care about the rest).**

**I'd appreciate any advice on this! I remember being able to recover some lost files on my computer by looking into systemic forderes and finding some strangely named temporary files - my father helped me with that at the time, and this is really the kind of advice I'm looking for from pros, since it is highly unlikely that I'll get my photos back in any conventional way (yes, I have checked the trash both in Google Photos and on my devi etc.)**

Thanks a lot in advance! I really hope I can get those photos back, it seems so strange that they would disappear and not even be in the trash (which I normally use).... I only have like 3 of them in shitty quality that I sent to someone through Facebook Messenger that day.
