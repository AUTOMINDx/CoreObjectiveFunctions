Is it ok to spend your 21st birthday with your parents?
my birthday's in March. I live in Miami so my mom offered to drive me and my dad down to key west and have my first experience at a bar w/ them there. I don't have any friends that live down here they all moved for university in other states so I really have no one to spend it with. But is it too uncool to spend your birthday with just your parents?
