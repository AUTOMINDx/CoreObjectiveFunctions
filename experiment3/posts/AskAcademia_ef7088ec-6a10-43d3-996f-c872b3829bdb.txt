Can industry professionals who only have a Master’s become professors?
If someone has been working in a field for several years and is essentially an expert in it, could they teach a class or become a professor? Especially for subjects like CS, statistics, finance, business, etc, which are often very industry-oriented (assuming they also hold a master’s)?

I’ve seen the title “industry professor” before and my instructor for intro to CS only had a bachelors (she had graduated from my school with honors) and had been in the workforce for a few years. Also, one of my statistics professors only had a masters but was a full on professor and even did research. So I suppose it isn’t unheard of but is it common in such industry-oriented fields?
