Help get my **** together
Hate text walls so I'm gonna try my best to be blunt and concise, sorry if I seem brash.

23m live with gf only work experience doordash/manual labor jobs and ~$10,000 from a video game path of exile(if that's even applicable). Dad od'ed when I was in hs never had any mentors in life. Grades sucked like a 1.8 gpa cause I didn't give a damn and skipped all classes. Only life skills is that I'm intelligent, 33 on the ACT, 99th percentile on the TEAS test, can type 150wpm, https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/ 70 on this. Besides that what I have going for me is 22$ in my bank account, a supportive gf, a car and actual desire to apply myself now. What would be some of the best steps to fix my past years of fucks ups, what would you do in my situation?

Career path doesn't matter too much, whatever would be optimal. I just can't take delivering taco bell for another 10 years being forever poor like I was growing up lol.

Any general advice beyond career advice would be more than helpful too, I don't know anything about anything.
