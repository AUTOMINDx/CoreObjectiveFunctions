is it selfish to come out during the holidays?
i’ve been wanting to come out all year. in fact my new year’s resolution for 2021 was to come out. i’ve been setting deadlines. “i’ll come out during summer break” “i’ll come out before my birthday” “i’ll come out this fall”

family members from out of state will be in town to hang out during the holidays, including my nana who is my biggest supporter in life.

i don’t want to wait anymore. i’ve lived enough of my life trying to suppress and hide who i am. i want to be free. i want to be the son i was meant to be.

but i don’t want to be selfish. the holidays is about friends and family. i don’t want to make it about me. i’m tempted to wait until next year but knowing me, i’ll just push it back more and more. 

i wanted to know other folks thoughts on this. is it selfish to come out during the holiday season?
