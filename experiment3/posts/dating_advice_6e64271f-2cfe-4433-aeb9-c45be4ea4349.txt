HELP Is it weird that he called me "his" after 2 days of talking ?
I matched a guy on Hinge 4 days ago.

On Day 1, he joked about marriage, about asking for my father's phone number and about me meeting his parents and grandparents that don't even live in the same country.

On Day 2, he made me talk to his friends without any previous warning and told me he really liked me and wanted to learn more about me. He asked if we could meet face-to-face in the 2 following weeks. His last message that Day was "Good night, mine".

On Day 3, he sent me a couple of pictures that I didn't open yet and sent me his phone number.

Now we are on Day 4 and I don't know what to do. We have never met but he's already freaking me out. The fact that he called me "his" is something I can get past. Even under normal circumstances, I don't like being treated as someone else's property but here, we only talked for 2 days.

What should I do ?
