Would Biden cancelling student loan debt have any potential impact on the current inflation rate in the US?
I understand that generally speaking, this administration would like to get current inflation rates down from where they currently are.  Is it possible that this goal potentially influenced their recently announced decision that they will not be cancelling student loan debt, and debtors will be expected to resume paying on their loans relatively soon?  

Or is student loan debt unrelated to inflationary policy?
