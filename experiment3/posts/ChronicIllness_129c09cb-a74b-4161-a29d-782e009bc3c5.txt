I'm so disappointed in my dad.
Edit: Update: got a text message (this is how my little brother tells me things like this) that dad called 911 and is in the hospital for observation on his heart. He's been in several times this year and has a history of quadruple bypass. Sigh. I stressed him out so much I put him in the hospital. It's 6:30ish am. I'm going to work my way to functioning and head over to be with him. Should have just kept my mouth shut. 

My dad called today and said my aunt and uncle were in town and would I like to have lunch with them this week. I said sure. 

Now, I don't go out very often as I have several AI diseases and take 2 different immunocompromising drugs. I will go out with family to eat, but I only unmask to eat. When I visit with them I am laying a lot of trust in them that they are taking precautions to not get me sick. 

After my call with my dad I remembered that my aunt and uncle are antivaccers. So I called my dad back, who says "yeah, I wondered if you'd remember that." It wasn't til I hung up that my brain went, wait, what?! He knew there was an issue but didn't bring it up to remind me, thus potentially allowing me to be in an at risk situation! WTH? 

So tomorrow I'll be calling to tell him how disappointed I am in him and that he will need to have a rapid test done before coming to my house for Christmas. And when he gets upset, cause he will, I will remind him to lay that at my uncle's feet not mine. 

I've heard these stories before, I honestly never thought it would happen to me. I feel so hurt (can't find a better word) that he would be so callous about my health.
