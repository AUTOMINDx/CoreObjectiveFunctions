Entitled mother didn't let me cook because "her son must sleep".
So, yesterday i was home alone. My mom would just come back in the next day, today in other words, so i could do whatever I want. Then, it was almost 10pm and i decided to cook something because i was hungry, but in the end, a pan fell on the ground. But there's a problem: Just that noise was enough for the entitled parent that I'll call "Karen" come to my door and ring the bell like crazy and spank the door, not knock. I didn't answer because I was with pajamas and shit, and i wouldn't go there all messy, but i could hear that she even went to talk with my other neighbor that lives under me. The night passes and it's a bright new day. Around 6pm, my mom comes and asks me to help her with the groceries. I went to there and when we came back, Karen opened the door (what showed she was literally waiting for my mother to come) and started saying that needed to talk with her... But she didn't say what truly happened. She said that i was in the living room screaming like a little child at 3am and that her 2yo son needed to sleep. And then, when i said i was actually in the kitchen, the other neighbor comes and says "That's not true. You were actually in the living room" like, did they actually do it together?? Obviously, 2 against 1 and my mom believed in the neighbors, even when I told her that it was actually around 10pm and i was in the fucking kitchen. And you know what makes it worse? I'm used to stay awake at night, and that means i can hear almost everything that happens at night. I ALWAYS hear her son running, screaming like it's being tortured and crying at 3am. Have i ever done the same thing she did to her? Never, but the first noise that she hears she already makes a scandal.
