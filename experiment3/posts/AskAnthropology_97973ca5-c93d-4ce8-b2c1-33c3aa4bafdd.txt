Why is Jesus a common name in Latin America but not in Spain?
I came across this as a specific example in  a totally unrelated book, when it was discussing how theophoric placenames do not necessarily reflect underlying cultural practices. It was offered as an example that Jesus is a rare given name in Europe, despite Catholicism (and Christianity on the whole of course, though the book specifically named Catholicism) not exactly being unheard of in the region.

It was just a passing example, and since the book has nothing to do with Christianity or Latin America it moved on without further comment. But now I am wondering, why *is* that?
