My girlfriend 19f has been recently diagnosed with brain aneurysm and I need to understand it better to support her
Hi,

My girlfriend who's 19 has been diagnosed with brain aneurysm and I have not been able to get more details out of her but here's what I know.

She experienced fainting and headache and had visited a nearby hospital wherein after an MRI it was noted that she has an inoperable brain aneurysm.

These are the details that I have and I want to know what this means and what are the treatment options. And what do I need to do to take good care of her.

 I will keep updating you on the status as I get more details.


Edit 1: More information- it's a small aneurysm on an acute artery on the brain stem.
