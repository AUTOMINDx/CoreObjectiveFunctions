Gerd UPDATE &amp; Symptoms to help others
Hi All, 

I've been battling GERD due to taking too much ibuprofen &amp; antibiotics and wanted to share my journey to help anyone else in the future who has to go through what I did since I've noticed there aren't many posts on GERD that is caused by medication. I am very healthy, never ate poorly, 24 year old female, 5'6, \~120 lbs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Symptoms:** 

Initially: Nausea, Anxiety, Heart Palpitations, Heart Fluttering, Left Upper Arm Pain, Left Armpit Pain, Sharp pain under left breast (top ribcage left side), Burping, Acid in back of throat, waking up in the middle of the night in a panic

1 month later: Left Upper Arm Pain, Left Armpit Pain, Sharp pain under left breast (top ribcage left side), Burping, Acid in back of throat, Muscle spasms all over the body, Back Pain upper left area, Right side chest pain, Sternum pain

Medications I'm taking: I was taking Spironolactone and stopped 3 weeks ago, now I am only on oral birth control pills &amp; nothing else. I tried over-the-counter omeprazole 20mg for 1 day and had the WORST side effects, my left wrists were hurting, super intense stomach pains all day &amp; heart skipping a beat for 24 hours so I decided I was not going to take it anymore. 

**What has helped:** 

\- I am on the acid reflux diet for almost a month now! You can google this and basically I eat all the foods on the diet that I know won't cause me heartburn. Even some foods on the acid reflux diet have caused my heartburn to be severe, so it's trial and error for everyone, however what worked for me was, rice, ground turkey 99% lean, dairy/yogurt ONLY 0% FAT, root vegetables (beets, potato, sweet potato), super lean chicken, oatmeal, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, cucumbers, multigrain bread etc. I eliminated pretty much everything that you're not supposed to eat and have not cheated once, since I do not want to have any flare ups! 

\- Sleeping on an elevation with 2 pillows, helped me not wake up with a sore throat / acid taste

\- Sleeping on my left side, not sure why this helps, but I've noticed it does tremendously 

\- Drinking a lot of water throughout the day &amp; chamomile tea

**Next Steps:**

I have an appointment with a Gastroenterologist in about 2 weeks and I will update to see if I will need to get an endoscopy or my treatment plan!

**Overall:**

I am feeling much better than I have this past month, where I was in chronic pain, heart wouldn't stop beating out of my chest, chest pains, and although I still have these pains, they are less severe than they were and I am thinking it is due to my eating habits &amp; lifestyle changes. I do not know what the treatment plan for GERD is if it is due to NSAIDs, however I am trying to heal myself from within and not taking more medication unless absolutely necessary.
