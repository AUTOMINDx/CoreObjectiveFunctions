My company is asking me to move across the country. Should I ask for more money even if I like the idea?
My company has requested that I move from NYC to the west coast. I actually like the idea of trying out a new city. I am also in line to get a promotion and a raise soon (regardless of if I move).  Should I ask or expect an additional salary boost since Iâ€™m helping them out by going to a new city?

I mean this beyond just them covering my moving expenses. The cost of living is essentially the same between the two cities.
