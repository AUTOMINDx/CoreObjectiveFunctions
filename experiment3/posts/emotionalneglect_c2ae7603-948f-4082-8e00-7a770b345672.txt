“Nothing bad happened”
When you find yourself invalidating yourself by saying “nothing bad happened,” rephrase it as “nothing good happened.” 

Because what about the good things that are vital for a child’s development? Emotional neglect is the omission of love, support, care, guidance, emotional responsiveness etc. And okay, your mind may point out good things that happened but what about when you really needed them? Children/teens need constant emotional care… not occasional, not unpredictable. 

Would you parent yourself the same way you were parented?
