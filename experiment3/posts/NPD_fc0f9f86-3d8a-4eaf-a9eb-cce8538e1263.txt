How to laugh at mistakes when someone calls you out.
Someone calls you out in a group, eg. you say movie instead of show.  Big deal, what you meant in your head was not what your mouth said.

No one should flip their shit, "you know what I meant" or let it get to them much if at all.

How do you laugh that off and say, oh *lol* yes, that's what I meant, show.

It is distracting though and a bit startling.

How to you moreso accept you misspeak without escalating, or making big mistakes.

Is it best to ignore it, say you know what I mean, but calmly? For the times when you feel a bit startled.
