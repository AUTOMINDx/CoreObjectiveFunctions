Roomate Drunk Driving
I’m in my mid 20’s living with my boys from college. One of the guys drinks and drives on a regular basis. I’m not talking buzzed driving, this guy gets hammered. I have confronted him several times and told him the consequences. I have brought up my past experiences regarding this (my teammate in high school died drunk driving and one of my sister best friends did the same) and it just doesn’t stick. He doesn’t give a shit. No idea what to do. 

Thanks
