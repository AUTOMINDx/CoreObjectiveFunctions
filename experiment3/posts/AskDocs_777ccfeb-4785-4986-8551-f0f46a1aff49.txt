Fizzing in skull when hungry
Lets try this again-I've googled this before and all I get is other people asking the same question and confirming that it happens to others. When really hungry (usually when waking up) I will get a strange intermittent fizzy noise at the base of my skull. Its always been there, that I can remember but as far as I knew, just in my head. Today my son was hanging out in our bed and it happened. He heard it! It was great having someone else confirm the noise. I didnt realize it was audible outside of my head.  Does anyone have an actual medical explanation? Does it have a name?
And to all my fellow brain fizzers- I see you, we are not alone!

Female, 40s, overweight, latina, no pain but I have noticed it all my life, living in the USA, "feel" and hear it coming from the base of my skull.  I can compare it to fizzing or pop rocks for a few seconds around my cerebellum. I've had spinal disc issues since childhood in my sacral/lumbar area, but this is in my skull.
