Derealization makes me too zoned out to have conversations with people.
Basically what the title says. I am so zoned out I can’t even talk to people anymore. I’ll start talking and space out and forget about what I’m saying or I can’t find the right words. It’s gotten to the point where even talking to my husband causes an adrenaline rush and I just want to lay down and close my eyes. Anything social gives me such intense anxiety I have to drink just to cope with it. This has gone on for over 4 years now and I just feel so god damn hopeless.
