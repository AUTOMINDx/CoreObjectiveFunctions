Do not open a joint account with them. If you are a minor, hide your money until you are 18, and open an account solely in your name
I am a bank teller.

Yesterday, I had the displeasure of helping a man who told me he wanted to "withdrawal his daughter's life savings." In those exact words.

As an ACoN, I really did not want to do it. 

But she was a minor signed under his name. 

I felt sick doing it. And he could, because it's policy he can.

Do not open a bank account with them as co-signer.

Do not do it.

Hide your money in the woods, wrapped in multiple covers.

But do not sign anything with them.
