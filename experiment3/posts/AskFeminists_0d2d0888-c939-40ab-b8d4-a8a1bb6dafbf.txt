Is internalized misandry a thing?
Someone recently told me that I had it. And Google didn’t really come up with anything besides something from urban dictionary.

Edit: sorry poor wording on my part and you can’t edit titles, so more what I mean is that do you think this a phenomena that can occur? Since from my Google search nothing came up I figured it was probably not a word.
