[ARG] I'm being promoted but worried about HR discovering my secret
I have been working in a bank for the last 4 years. I never claimed to have a degree, but implied to my boss and coworkers that I was working on it (untrue).

Today I was pulled into a meeting by my boss. Attending this meeting were a coworker (let's call him Bob), my boss, my boss' boss and a couple other managers from Investment Banking.

I was informed that Bob leaves next month and that I was being promoted to his position (so I'm moving from Fianancial Analyst to Senior Financial Analyst). My boss' boss praised my work, my engagement (I've been focusing heavily on work in the last couple of years) and pointed out how it was a great opportunity for me to learn and to continue growing within the bank (I've observed in the last couple years that the company prefers to promote employees from within instead of hiring external talent). I was very surprised, they didn't even ask if I was interested.

My boss' boss told me HR would be contacting me by the middle of January to "talk money".  I'm worried they might look into my education and find out I don't have the degree I implied years ago I was getting soon, should I be worried about this?
