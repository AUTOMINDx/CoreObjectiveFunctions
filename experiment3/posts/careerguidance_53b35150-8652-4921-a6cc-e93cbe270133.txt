How can I tell my manager that I feel I’m being underpaid?
My current role has a 6month probation period. Not long now and I’d have my probation review.

In the initial application stage I made the mistake of not negotiating salary. I feel I’m being paid less in my industry and deserve more. How can I ask for a higher salary, how do I go about it?

Suggestions are highly appreciated.
