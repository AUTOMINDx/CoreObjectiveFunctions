Advice/Support
tw// unacceptable family  

Im 16 and my brother came out as trans. I came out genderqueer before him but got no support from my family. Flash forward a few years he’s had gender affirming surgery and i have yet to get hormones. I tried to come out to my mom as a trans guy not too long ago and she rejected it. I hold no anger towards my brother, only my mom. I’m at a loss. I’m contacting my doctor to get the steps in motion for counseling, any advice?
