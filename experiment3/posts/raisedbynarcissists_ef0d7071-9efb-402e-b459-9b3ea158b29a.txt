My parents deny abuse by saying "there are multiple truths" and "I have my reality of what happened and you have your reality"
My parents are no longer in my life for good, but the last time I recently spoke to them, they denied abuse by saying "there are multiple truths" and "I have my reality of what happened and you have your reality"

This is how my parents deny the sexual, emotional and physical abuse towards me and avoid accountability. My dad is also saying him having high functioning autism could explain his sexual staring* towards me. He has also denied doing certain abusive things and is rewriting history to favor himself.

I am feeling gaslighted but also confused because it is true there are multiple truths and perspectives.. but that does not effect the impact. Thoughts of their statements?

*There is more to the story than just his staring. He exhibited a lot of behaviors indicating he was attracted to me and treated me like a girlfriend. A lot of power/control abusive tactics like financial abuse, getting mad when I didn't want to cuddle with him, being jealous when I was dating, putting down my self esteem, saying I looked bad without makeup, and trying to make it hard for me to leave the home.
