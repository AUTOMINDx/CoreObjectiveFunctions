Nobody wants a broken man.
I'm half drunk while posting this, but I feel so incredibly sad. I'm broken in every way, and there is no way anybody wants that. My self esteem is nonexistent at this point, I'm depressed af, skinnier than a skeleton, boring, ugly, neurodivergent probably, and probably other shit that I can't think of in this state. I will always be alone and knowing that fucking hurts. Why don't I just kill myself? There is no point in living. I'm legit fucking crying rn because Im so fucking pathetic.
