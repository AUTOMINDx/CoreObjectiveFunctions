i don't like STEM but they're about the only degrees that can give me a job. So what should i do?
i dislike and am not really good at all in STEM and scientific subjects in general (i have tried also). i'd like to pursue a degree that can give me a decent-paying job that i like or at least i don't hate. The problems is that those jobs seems to be only in the STEM field that i dislike. My passion is mostly in the humanities and arts but of course it's very hard to get jobs in those fields. Please, can anyone tell me what should i do exactly? i am rather desperate and this situation makes me literally cry every time i think about it. i know it is pathetic. i just want to know what exactly should i do..
