What time does the loneliness hit you hardest?
For me it's right after I get in bed and right when I wake up.  Something about being about to fall asleep (when I'm lucky) and right after I wake up I just get really anxious and it causes me to wake up at 5am and not be able to fall back to sleep for hours.  I find that reading helps, meditation sometimes, but mostly I just feel empty and it's difficult to handle.
