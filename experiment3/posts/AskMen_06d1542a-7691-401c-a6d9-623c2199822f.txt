How do I tell my girlfriend her noises/moans during sex make me uncomfortable?
My gf usually moans in a very… I’m not sure what’s the correct expression, painful sounding way maybe? I often find myself slowing down/stopping and asking if she’s ok (I’m a bit more on the sensitive/nurturing side personality-wise) and she always tells me there’s nothing wrong, these sounds just come naturally to her when she’s enjoying it. But I still can’t help but be turned off by them somewhat. Still, I can’t expect her to be quiet or moan/make sounds differently if this is what’s natural to her. I’m not sure what we can do or how I should approach this. Any advice?
