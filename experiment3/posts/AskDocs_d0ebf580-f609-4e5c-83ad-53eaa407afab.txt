I'm suddenly very stupid and forgetful 26f
In the last 2 or 3 months I've gone from being very sharp and quick thinking to struggling with basic math, remembering things I just said,  important dates, why I've walked into a room. It took me 5 hrs to place an order for clothing and I just realized today I got everything in a size i havent been in many years. Im easily distracted and have a hard time following through all of which is very VERY  uncharacteristic of me. I know part could be poor sleep but this feels excessive. Any ideas? What should I know about this?

Edit:Wow thank you to everyone who reached out even though I'm 9 months past birth  im seeing this could be  post partum related. I've gotten a ton of suggestions and feed back that I think will be helpful and could fit what's going on. 
Some top takeaways for me were the b12 and other vitamin suggestions. I haven't been taking my prenatal while breastfeeding so I could just be low on viatmins. 
The next would be to get a full thyroid panel instead of just the TSH test. I didn't think imaging could be an option for what Im going through either so there's that too. Other than that I'm going to try my best to track and write down everything moving forward.  

Also to those saying carbon monoxide you guys are MVPS because I've seen another post where it literally saved someone's life!!! So thank you for that.
