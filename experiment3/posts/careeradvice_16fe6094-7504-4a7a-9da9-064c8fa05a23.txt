Have you ever reached out to someone who held the position you’re applying to via LinkedIn?
I’m searching for a new job in my niche field of Trade Compliance, and I was wondering if anyone ever tried searching for people who held a position at the company you want to apply to? Like find the old person who worked there and ask their experience.

Have you ever tried doing this? Or has anyone ever contacted you asking how it was while working at an old position?
