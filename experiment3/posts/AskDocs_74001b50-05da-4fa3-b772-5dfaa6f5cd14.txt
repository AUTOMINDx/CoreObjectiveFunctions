Is it possible to "defecate out" a virus or illness? (25M)

After 6 days of some brutal flu symptoms, I had a very aggressive bowel movement last night. I woke up this morning feeling incredible. I had no stomach or digestive discomfort at this time or in the past few weeks. My symptoms included severe chills, fever, aches, congestion, headache, and fatigue. 

I tested negative for 2 covid tests (Rapid &amp; PCR) and have no idea what this could have been. I share almost all of my meals with my roommate or my S/O and both of them are healthy. The past 6 days I have had regular BM's and have been eating mostly fruits and plain foods (bananas, oranges, oatmeal, toast, etc) I don’t think it's something I ate. 

Details of the BM: I had to pass gas and unexpectedly leaked a bit. Rushed to the bathroom and immediately let loose a powerful stream of liquid fecal matter. I never felt an evacuation of this magnitude before, it was brown in color and I was unable to see if there were any solid pieces.  Halfway through, I felt and heard my stomach turning for a moment. It seemed to reload another BM into the chamber as if it was a pump-action shotgun and blasted immediately. I have never experienced this before in my life. I showered and went to bed getting my best night of sleep in days. Woke up feeling none of the symptoms I felt from the past 6 days. 

Is it possible to just sh\*t out an illness? Is this a regular phenomenon? Can I trust my rear end to pass gas again? I don’t think it's food poisoning or the stomach flu but I'm no doctor. Sorry if this was gross, thanks for reading.
