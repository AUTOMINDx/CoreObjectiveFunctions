My wife asked me if I honestly thought her friends were attractive, what should I say ?
We went to a dinner for a wedding and her friends were there. We greeted them and I said "wow aren't you ladies all spiffied up" but in a friendly way. 

My wife agreed and told them they looked amazing. When we went to take our seats. She asked me if they looked better than her and I said no because they didn't. She then asked me I thought they were attractive. I just said they looked well dressed and left it there.

She gave me a unsatisfied "hmmm". I know she probably won't leave it alone but did I give the right answer.
