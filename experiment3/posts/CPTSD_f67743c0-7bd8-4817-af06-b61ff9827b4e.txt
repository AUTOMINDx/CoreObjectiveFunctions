A lot of uncommented posts are actually read by a lot of people.
Hi, I just want to say, a lot of posts get no comments but I'm pretty sure a lot of people (me included) still read them. I often see people sad that no one commented on their post. I get that it sucks but each situation is complex and it's hard to comment something meaningful in a few seconds.

If you don't get any comments, don't give up. Sometimes just posting at a different time will get better results.

Hope that's helpful.
