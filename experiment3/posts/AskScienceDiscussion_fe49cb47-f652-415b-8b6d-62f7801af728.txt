Has studying the various aspects of SARS-COV-2 over the past two years led to any discoveries or breakthroughs in virology that extend beyond this virus.
Beyond things specifically related to this virus, I'm curious to know if there have been any specific advancements that will be more generally applicable to other viruses, or to future pandemic causing viruses.
