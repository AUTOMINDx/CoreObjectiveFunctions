good annotated books for getting started with philosophy? (16F)
i’ve read the stranger, the myth of sisyphus, and apology of socrates (all of which i enjoyed!) i also watched prof. michael sandel’s lectures on Justice.
some books im interested in are critique of pure reason, nicomachean ethics, and beyond good and evil. can anyone recommend some others as well?
in particular, im interested in ethics/metaethics, existentalism, and nihilism, but as a beginner, i'm open to anything
