Age: 52 
Gender: Male 
Ethnicity: White 

Propofol (450 mg) was intravenously given during a colonoscopy procedure. Discharge was at 4:30pm, suicide occurred next day around the hours of 5:30am-10:30am. 
Could the drug have impaired judgment? Suicidal thoughts? Should someone had been with patient for at least 24 hours?
