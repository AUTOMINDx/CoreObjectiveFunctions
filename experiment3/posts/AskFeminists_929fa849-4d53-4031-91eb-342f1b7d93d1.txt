Did Andrea Dworkin advocate for incest and beastiality in “Women Hating”?
I might’ve misunderstood what she meant but what did she mean by “The destruction of the incest taboo is essential to the de­velopment of cooperative human community based on the free-flow of natural androgynous eroticism.” and “Needless to say, in androgynous community, human and other-animal relationships would become more explicitly erotic, and that eroticism would not degen­ erate into abuse.” She later says this in the end of the book “Ive in effect advocated fucking animals, thats ok.” 

Could someone explain to me what she really meant by this?
