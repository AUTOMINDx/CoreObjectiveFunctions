New York City just banned gas hookups in new construction. Do you support this move?
This isn't a requirement to get rid of existing gas, just a ban on new installations in new buildings and is focused on both decarbonization and on particulate emissions and would basically prevent new buildings from using gas stoves, furnaces, or water heaters.
