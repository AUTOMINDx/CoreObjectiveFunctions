I just found out you can only get pregnant 6 days a month, so how are all these people getting “accidentally” pregnant?
I’m a girl in my early twenties and have just found out about this. So how do accidental pregnancies happen so often if you can only get pregnant 6 days a month? Are most people not using any protection at all? Are most people having sex multiple times a day the entire month? Can someone explain?

Edit: thank you all so much for all the information!
