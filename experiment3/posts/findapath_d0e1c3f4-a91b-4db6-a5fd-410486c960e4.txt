21, about to graduate with a CS degree, hate technology
So I guess I'll start this by saying some about myself. I'm 21, male, eastern USA, and my parents kinda pushed me into Computer Science before college. It's good money, there's a lot of jobs, blah blah blah - and those aren't false, but the kicker is that I truly despise technology. I think that phones, social media, internet etc. are a plague on society and I can't morally justify to myself the idea of working within a field that I think is actively making peoples' lives worse. When I'm on my deathbed, I'd like to think that what I chose to spend my life doing left a positive mark on the world. What I'm trying to avoid at all costs is being on my deathbed and thinking that my existence was a net negative for the world.

Now that I've said what I dislike I should probably say what I like. I think that the greatest thing in this world is nature, and I would be fulfilled with a life spent protecting or studying it, as that would make me feel like I'm helping leave something positive for future generations to experience. If I could turn back time 4 years I would go out west and get a degree in biology or forestry but I've learnt not to dwell on regrets. I guess my question is what can I do from here? Is there any use for a CS degree in nature/conservation/park service jobs? Are there jobs in those fields that leave a positive impact but don't require a relevant degree? Or am I stuck doing unskilled but morally neutral work (like waitstaff)? Any advice would be helpful. Thank you to anyone who reads this.
