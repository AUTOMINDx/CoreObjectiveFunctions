Using ur diagnosis to get admiration
It may sound weird and ignorant, but being self-aware and in recovery I caught myself boasting to other people about the progress I've made in therapy, that I started to develop empathy, care about others, act less toxic etc. Most people who think that narcissism is harmful abusive way to treat others admire my recovery and I get supply from it. Anyone else?
