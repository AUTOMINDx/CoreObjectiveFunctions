Hi! I was told I have fibromyalgia, until!
I don't know about anyone else, but I have had the term fibromyalgia thrown around for my health for 3 years. I was told that no one would be able to tell me what's wrong, and be able to diagnose anything, especially with every test being nornal! No doctors were able to tell me what's wrong! And then! This year a doctor decided to test for autoimmune diseases, because fibromyalgia has a lot of symptoms that present as autoimmune diseases. I tested positive. I see rheumatology to do further testing to see which one I actually have. Hurray! Finally my pain can be diagnosed and treated. 
Feeling thankful
