Getting comfortable with vulnerability and creating meaningful relationships
Growing up with an alcoholic parent, I’ve spent the last 5 years of living out of the house to process and reflect on the chaos I grew up in. 

I’ve had a lot of successes in my healing journey especially finding peace with my relationship with my parents now

The outstanding issue i deal with now is overcoming my fears of vulnerability that have become habitual and deeply ingrained from my childhood. I’ve gotten close to being in serious relationships but i end up pushing them away. Same with friendships. 

Im a stellar first date when i put on the performance, but I’m quick to go in my shell and shut down or put up a front when a relationship pierces through the surface level. 

I know i have so much love to give, but i think there is a level of internalized self hatred from childhood coping mechanisms that keeps getting in the way from properly expressing that.

How can i start practicing how to overcome this?? I feel like i understand where this is coming from, but i don’t know how to overcome that inner child voice and instincts in the moment. 

Would love to hear anyone else’s journeys in overcoming vulnerability issues and finding meaningful relationships!
