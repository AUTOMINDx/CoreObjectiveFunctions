How do I (19F) recover from (what I consider) to be the most embarrassing moment of my life?
This happened yesterday in class, one of my friends (let's call her Anna), was sitting directly behind me, while my crush (let's call him James), was sitting right next to her.

Now I had told Anna about my crush just a week before, and since she does not know him, she did not recognize him right next to her, meaning that she unknowingly started asking me (rather loudly) to point out my crush among my class, all while James was staring at the both of us.

Needless to say, I absolutely freaked out, I then stood up from my seat to try and tell her subtly that he literally was right next to her. I have always been an insanely clumsy person, so after I tried whispering as quietly as I could that James was RIGHT THERE, I tripped and fell backwards, on my ass, on the floor.

Fortunately I was not hurt anywhere other than my pride and dignity, but unfortunately I was sitting towards the front that day, so EVERYONE in my class saw me go down with a loud bang, at that moment I just wanted to crawl into a hole and die.

The cherry on top of it all is that I'm pretty sure that James heard me telling Anna that it was him (my whispering was probably not as quiet as I thought it was). He has left me on read for an entire day and has not responded to any of my texts, which I am also stressing about.

How do I recover from this? I've been trying to reassure myself that everything was fine all day today, but this moment keeps coming up in my brain and ruining my mood. How do I get this out of my system? Also how do I salvage my friendship with James without making it awkward and weird?

Please send help.

Edit: Thank you all for the funny and kind comments! They definitely helped me center myself and I've been feeling a lot better about this :))
