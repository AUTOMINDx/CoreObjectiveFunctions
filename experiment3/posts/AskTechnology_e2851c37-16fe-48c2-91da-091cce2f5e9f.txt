What device would you recommend buying for pdf reading?
I have a bunch of paperwork on pdf, some of it scanned letters written by hand that I cannot convert to more solid formats like epub. 

Also I don't really care about videos, apps, music, storage or notes I just want it to have lots of battery, not get blind with small words, be able to read with color and be as portable as possible. 

I've seen the 10'' e-readers and some tablets but I still haven't seen any specific brand or model, what would you recommend? 

Thanks in advance for your advices!
