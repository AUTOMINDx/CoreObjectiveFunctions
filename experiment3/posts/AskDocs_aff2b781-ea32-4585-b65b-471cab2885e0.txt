What is the life expectancy for somebody that has endometrial cancer and doesn't get treatment for it?
Here's the deal...  I'm 28 years old, 5'5'', and a 115 pound female.  I have pelvic pain and discharge almost all of the time and I am exhausted 24/7.  I have also had BV and have had 4 rounds of Flagyl and 5 Diflucan pills.  My BV doesn't seem to not want to go away.    My doctors say that my endometrium went from 1.2cm to 1.5cm from July 2021 to September 2021.  They said for somebody my age and somebody my size, I'm way too young and way too little to have an endometrium that thick, so that is why they are thinking endometrial cancer.  I also have ascites, because I am bloated all the time, nauseated constantly and can barely eat anything.  You can just hear the water sloshing around.  I've felt this way for about 8 years.  And if it is any relevance, I used to be anorexic for about a year.  I am completely recovered from that now.  And during that time of my anorexic, I didn't have a period, so I'm questioning whether that had something to do with it.  My cycles are heavy and regular now.

Now, out of the experiences I've gone thru, I saw both parents go thru chemo, and radiation and die from AML and brain cancer.  Even though this is a different type of cancer, I've made the mental decision on to not get treatment for it, and to be honest, I 'm not even sure if I want the biopsy anymore.  I'm tired enough, and I don't want to put my body thru that.

So my question to you doctors out there, how long of a life expectancy would I have since I'm not getting treatment?

Thank you for all and any feedback.  It is much appreciated.  &lt;3
