New boss is asking for my help in outsourcing my own job. What should I do?
I've been working with my company for a few years. I was recently moved onto a new team but with the same position but a huge focus on cutting even more costs. 

My new manager's boss has asked me to get pricing from potential companies that could do my job. It was a request in front of many others and well known that it is my job. I feel extremely uncomfortable doing this. As they want me to get the best price. What is my incentive to negotiate a great price to have them replace me? It's unclear to me if this just means they want more from me in other capacities or if i am being stupid to help on this request. Is it bad to approach my boss to say, no i don't want to help outsource myself? Or do I do it and get the worst pricing possible to secure my own job?  

I LOVE LOVE LOVE my job and company UNTIL this moment. I've worked enough horrible jobs that I didnt want to leave a place i enjoyed. but  I don't feel comfortable asking a company if they can take over my job just to replace me. I am not sure how to approach this. I am in the process of buying a house alone and I am very nervous about job security now. Part of me wants to run for the hills and apply like crazy to other jobs but I also don't want to jump the gun if this is in my head and I'm overreacting.
