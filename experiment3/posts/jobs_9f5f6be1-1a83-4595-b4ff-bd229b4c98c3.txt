Rejected after interview and then saw they reposted the ad
I did two interview and a work sample task (3 hours to complete) for a job a month ago and was told Iâ€™d be invited for an in person interview this month. I got an email during the week to say they moved forward with another candidate. Later that same day I saw that the employer reposted the same job ad?

What happened here? Why would they lie?
