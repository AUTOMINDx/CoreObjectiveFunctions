Does therapy make sense for self improvement when you don’t have a mental illness or trauma?
I just struggle with self control and making myself exercise consistently, get good grades, etc. But I don’t have any trauma or an actual mental illness, I just feel like I need accountability on meeting my goals and a helping hand to guide me via proven techniques to set and achieve goals
