Holy crap. My mom admitted that she parentified me without me even bringing it up.
I have a younger brother who is only 18 months apart from me. He was diagnosed with autism when he was 2 and I was 3.5. 

It was my parents, husband, and myself discussing what I was like as a kid. I have always referred to myself as the perfect child and was joking about it with my parents when my husband (who was definitely the stereotypical unruly kid who ate worms lol) said there was no such thing as a perfect kid, and my mom looked at him and said "She was basically perfect. Obedient, clean, helpful, quiet, never talked back or was disrespectful. But she had to grow up too fast because she was a second mom to her brother." 

My jaw about dropped on the floor. Then my husband made a joke about how I regressed and we basically all agreed that I have. I personally don't feel as if I have matured past age 13. 

I just feel extremely validated. At least my parents have some idea of how it was for me growing up. Funnily enough my therapist brought up me having Asperger's when I was a teenager (a decade ago so that was still a diagnosis then) and I have been trying to get evaluated as an adult. I have heard that feeling mature as a kid and then childlike as an adult is a common theme with that as well so perhaps it's a double whammy combo. 

But man. I am still reeling.
