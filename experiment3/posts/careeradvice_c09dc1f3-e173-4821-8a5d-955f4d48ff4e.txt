How do I tell my manager at my new job work is too much for me?
Hi all - I started a new job two months ago and at the moment, I’m dreading going there tomorrow. The job description was clearly different than the work I am actually doing. They expect me to basically run the firm while I applied for an operational support role. There is an open role for a more senior employee, but currently I am doing their work. 

In the beginning I felt motivated to give it a try and just give my 100%, and figure I just aim for a promotion soon. However, I just simply can’t keep up with the workload. I just don’t have the experience to run the firm yet. I would love to stay at the company, but in the more calm, operational role I applied. Compared to the other offices, the people that do the work I’m currently doing have 10+ year more work experience. 

I am considering bringing this up to my manager, however, he has told me already multiple times that what I’m doing is what’s expected from me at the moment. Yet, he refuses to put me higher up on the org chart - which indicates he is aware that what I’m doing now is not in my job description.

Should I say something, or stay and wait until it all becomes better? It’s a new job after all, and all beginnings are difficult.
