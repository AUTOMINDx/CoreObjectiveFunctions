Slowly deleting socials and addictions
I deleted messenger today! Gave my cell number to a few people I normally talk to. 

Deleted Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram 8 months ago, Twitter 3 months ago. 

I still have TikTok and Reddit. I do make TikToks but really limit my time on the app (only 30 minutes very other day - I enjoy making content and have subs that seem to grow everyday) 

It’s been 1 month since I quit weed and cigarettes. 

It’s been 18 months since I’ve had alcohol. 

What’s next? Porn and gaming. 

I do find difficulties in replacing all these habits with healthier habits. I want to read more, write more and be more physically active. 

Any advice on how I can start to incorporate these healthier options where it doesn’t feel forced but more organic?
