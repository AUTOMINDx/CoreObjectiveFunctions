Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas everyone! Whether you're staying home, going to friends &amp; families, or even not celebrating the holiday, I wish you all a wonderful day and minimal anxiety! 

For those of you who are like me and are venturing out to be overstimulated with family -- hang in there! If you want to just vent about how you feel to get if off your chest, please reach out! I may not reply immediately but I know how much that helps. I usually just post random updates on this sub because it helps gather my thoughts. 

Enjoy your day with whatever plans you may have! We're all in this together!
