Would learning coding be a waste of time for me?
So I know absolutely the bare minimum about coding. Just simple HTML from back in the MySpace days. I understand people don’t even generally use HTML anymore. Another issue is that I’m not maths or science minded. I studied English literature. But I have just been going between admin jobs my whole life (I’m 29). I just would like to do something in demand. Would it be a total waste of time for me to even try to learn even though I’m old now/don’t have the typical academic traits to learn? If anyone has any suggestions for other careers I could try for that would be cool too because I’m feeling totally lost :(
