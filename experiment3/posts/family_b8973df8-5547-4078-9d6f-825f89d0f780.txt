Anyone else’s mother call then just to talk about themselves?
I’m honestly fed up with it. I moved an hour away from my parents about a year ago, just to create some distance. My mom would just show up at my apartment without warning. Even when I’ve told her to call before she stops by. She does not understand boundaries, no matter how hard I try to enforce them.

Anyway, now she calls me 2-3 times a DAY, to talk about herself. She never asks me how I’m doing, and if she does, she doesn’t let me get but 2 words in before she’s back to talking about herself.

And it’s stuff that I do not care about. Like what she bought at the store. What she’s making for dinner. Gossip about family or her coworkers that I don’t care about, at all. I’m 25 years old with my own family now. I have a high needs 1 year old son who I know she’ll hear SCREAMING in the background while she tries to tell me what she bought on sale at Boscovs.

Just wondering if I’m the only one dealing with this lol

She’s 62 years old and doesn’t text or use social media. I’m sure that’s a contributing factor to why she calls me so much, but she could at least ask how I’m doing and listen to me when I respond.
