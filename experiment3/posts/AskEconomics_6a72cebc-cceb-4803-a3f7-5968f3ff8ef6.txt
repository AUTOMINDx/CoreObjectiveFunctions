In the last decade, real estate prices in Israel have risen by 365%, surpassing Switzerland's second place by more than double (165%). Tel Aviv is the world's most expensive city. What makes Israel so ridiculously expensive?
Here is the [jpost article](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/israeli-home-prices-rose-346-percent-in-a-decade-fastest-in-the-world-678028) about the rise of real estate in the last decade in Israel. And this year T[el Aviv is the world's most expensive city](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/tel-aviv-most-expensive-city-index/#:~:text=Tel%20Aviv%20has%20the%20highest%20cost%20of%20living%20of%20any%20city.&amp;text=As%20a%20result%2C%20this%20year,costly%20cities%20to%20live%20in).

Why? Israel may be small, but so are many other countries that are not as expensive. A lot of rich high tech people live in Tel Aviv, but not nearly at the level of wealth NYC, LA or London has. How can it that the most expensive country in the most affluent continent in the world which is Switzerland, has had less than half the growth in real estate prices than Tel Aviv?

And it's not just the real estate. Everything is more expensive here. Cars are 2x to 5x their cost in Germany. Some grocery purchases are 10x their American price. One pineapple will cost you 15USD, while Greece next door sells them for 1-2 Euros. And we grow them here! Clothes are so pricey, it's actually economic to fly to Europe and buy them there, while staying in a hotel, than buying a new wardrobe here.

Almost every third story on the news is about cost of living. Is there any reason for this situation? Have any economists studied Israel and know why it's one of the most expensive places on Earth?
