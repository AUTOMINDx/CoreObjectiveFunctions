I feel like everything i say to women is wrong when i text them.
I’ve been trying so many texting strategies with no success at this point don’t even know where to go from here. Im assuming how I’m texting just isn’t interesting to them because usually get ghost within couple messages. Ive had some success in past but it’s never been with someone i felt I want to be with long term. Ive been struggling with this problem since I was 18. Any recommendations what i can do to be better ?
