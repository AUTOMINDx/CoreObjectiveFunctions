About 2.5 years after my diagnosis, I no longer have PTSD.
I’ve been off of Reddit for almost a year, but I had to come back to say thanks. I’m not perfect, I still have trauma and still get depressed and anxious and angry. But according to the DSM I no longer fall under the category of PTSD. It’s crazy to look back and recognize how different I am now and how much easier it’s gotten to live with trauma. I just wanted to thank everyone here for support and community, and just say that it can and will get better. Please keep going.
