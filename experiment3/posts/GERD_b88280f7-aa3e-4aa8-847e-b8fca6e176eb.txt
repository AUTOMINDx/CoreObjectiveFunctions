Anyone have thick rubbery mucus in back of throat?
After eating does anyone experience a thick ball of rubbery mucus stuck in the back of the throat? Itâ€™s so thick it can be stuck back there for ever a week. 

This is my primary issue and was told it was because silent reflux. 

Anyone else experience this?
