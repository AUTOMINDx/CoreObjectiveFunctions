Finally starting life, but need a lot of help.
I am a 31 year old guy whose been dealing with crippling anxiety and health issues for the last fifteen years. I’m in a place where I finally want to and need to start my life, even if I’m doing so very late. I’ve never had a formal job on paper so I’m looking to figure out and navigate how to go about starting my life. I’m under no illusions I will be able to get a good job but outside of physical labor and fast food, I’m not picky.   


Any advice, or tips how to start my life? I feel a bit directionless even if I have the drive to begin, it’s almost a daunting task to try and finally do this but I can’t keep putting it off.
