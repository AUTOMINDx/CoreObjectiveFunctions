Are rich people mentally ill?
I always wondered if having more wealth than 99% of people is due to a mental illness. Are there any studies on this? My boss (who owns the company) recently bought a $200k Mercedes car but argues with us about using too much hot water in the kitchen sink that might cost him $0.10 more a day . How does that make any sense?
