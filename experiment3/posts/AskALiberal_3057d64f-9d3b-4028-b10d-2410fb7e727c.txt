What is the pathway for Democrats to retain the senate in 2022? Is it even possible?
I'm not very well read about all of the different senate races that will occur in 2022. I know the midterm elections don't usually favor the party in power, but is it possible for Democrats to retain control of the senate and house in 2022?
