Just found out my mom is cheating on my dad
I recently saw texts from my mother and another man where they discussed sleeping together. I don’t want to describe too much but it was clear that it was a sexual conversation. My parents’ relationship seems fine, but there could be things I do not know about. I am hesitant to tell my father directly, as they could have some form of an open relationship that I do not know about. I still feel like he deserves to know, but I have no idea what to do.
