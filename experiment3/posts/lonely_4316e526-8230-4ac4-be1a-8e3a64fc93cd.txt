Has loneliness made you bitter to the point of being hostile to others?
It has with me, despite the irony of me wanting friends in my life. But I've realized that people in modern society don't want relationships, just disposable people (on top of being shallow, fake and wilfully ignorant), and that's why I'm at the point where I feel the need to be hostile.

**Edit:** Thank you to everyone for contributing to this discussion. This is the first time I have had a reddit post make it to the top. It's good to know that I'm not alone in feeling this way.
