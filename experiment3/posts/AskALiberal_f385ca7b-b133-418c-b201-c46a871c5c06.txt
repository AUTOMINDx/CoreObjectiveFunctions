Is it possible for black people to commit racism against white people?
I've been reading about how various scholars are split on this issue.  There are basically two camps:

1. No, because racism fundamentally requires the victim of racism to be oppressed by said racism.  The mechanism by which this happens is power, and if black Americans do not have power and cannot oppress white people, they cannot, by definition, commit racism.  These scholars tend to view racism as solely consisting of structural racism.
2. Yes, because interpersonal racism is still racism.  Just as a person who shouts the N-word at a black person in passing is committing racism even if he or she isn't utilizing power to oppress the black person, a black person is able to commit interpersonal racism even if they aren't able to commit structural racism.  Some scholars also argue that black Americans do have some power -- even if they have less power than whites -- and are therefore able to commit racism via power and oppression.

What are your thoughts?  I will say that I find it strange to define racism as *strictly* structural racism.  While that might be the most deterimental form of racism in modern America, I think it's easy to imagine a single individual committing racism against another individual solely due to the nature of their interaction, regardless of its further consequences (i.e., oppression).
