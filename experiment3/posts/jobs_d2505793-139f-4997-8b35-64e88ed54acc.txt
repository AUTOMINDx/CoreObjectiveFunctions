It's Christmas Eve, I'm in the office
That's right, the office.   With a clueless mumblefuck of a boss meandering around trying to *make* work for us.   At first, we were supposed to be off today.   Then last night he says "ahh we absolutely *need* you in the office tomorrow until noon"...there's literally nothing to be done.   Then, come noon time today, he goes "there's too much to do, we have to keep you til 6 now"...again, there is nothing to be done.   This company also claims to have "christian beliefs", yet refuses to let their staff go home early on a FRIDAY CHRISTMAS EVE to be with their families.   This is also the same company that tried to cover up the fact two office employees tested positive for Covid, and get away with not telling anyone.

He's struggling to justify having us in, but refuses to let us go home.    My point here is, when you start a new job, find out how they treat their staff around the holidays.

Merry Christmas all, Happy Holidays, and be safe.
