[CA] Boss is pushing my employee to come to the office holiday party
One of my employee don’t want to come to the office holiday party. The party was organized last minute and this employee already had something planned that night. Moreover, this employee is working remotely (2.5 hours drive from the office party location) and our director don’t want the company to pay for an hotel room so he don’t have to drive back home in the middle of the night.

His reason not to come is very legit, and never I will force someone to attend an event after regular working hours. However, my boss is putting a lot of pressure on me to make sure that he comes. He even said that her not coming could compromise her chance to get his contract renewed and could impact my perception as a manager. Seriously, WTF!!! It’s just a Christmas dinner in a restaurant.

I want to stand for my employee, how can I address the situation with my director?

Thank you for your help!
