The underrated heroes
People who work in mental health field including therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental health techs, CNAs and others I may have missed are heroes that we don’t talk often about. Well the public and the media anyway. They may not be the ones taking care of people with COVID and fighting the pandemic but they definitely are fighting the plague of mental health issues. I started my first shift as a student nurse intern in psych unit that I was a patient at yesterday. We had two patients who had severe mental health conditions - one who had been there for over a month and half (it’s an acute care unit so most, if not 99% of people leave in about a week) because she couldn’t get placement in any LTC and had a guardian making all the decisions and another who was living in another world of her own. They were very combative and required frequent interventions. The social worker (who happened to be my social worker when I was there) was amazing at deescalating the situation. I never knew how powerful therapeutic communication and words could be. It was truly an eye opening moment in seeing how much mental health workers go through. The fact that they care so much for the patients to tolerate the verbal and sometimes physical abuse and being compassionate towards people who the society would deem insane and shun. And those in outpatient settings who try their best to keep people alive and protect them from their own minds. The nurses were the ones who inspired me to go into nursing and this just furthered my respect and admiration for them. 

So to therapists and other mental health care workers here and out there, you are the unsung heroes.
