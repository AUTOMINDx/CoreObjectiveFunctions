Is memory loss in daily life a part of PTSD?
So I know ptsd can cause you have memory loss about the traumatic event, but I’ve also heard people say it can cause memory loss in your daily life which is something i experience sometimes. Like I’ll completely forget about what happened during the week and things like that, and it’s usually during weeks where my ptsd acts up a lot. I just didn’t know that was because of ptsd. Anyone relate?
