All my doctors think I have an autoimmune disease except my rheumatologist lol
Posting as a rant because all my doctors believe the symptoms I have are caused by an autoimmune disease, however Iv been seeing a rheumatologist for two years now and he doesnâ€™t believe that and just says I have fibro and need to get into therapy
