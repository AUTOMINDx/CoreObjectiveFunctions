Sometimes I wish my abuser was dead or didn’t exist.
I feel like a terrible person for wishing someone would never experience happiness or freedom. Here we are tho. I hate him so much it hurts. It hurts knowing he’s out there living his life. I lost people over him. They chose him. He fucked up my life. I don’t know trust or love anymore. I don’t want to know happiness because what he did to me has made me miserable despite therapy and time. He doesn’t deserve to be happy. He deserves to feel the pain I do. I’m terrible for saying it but it’s how I feel.
