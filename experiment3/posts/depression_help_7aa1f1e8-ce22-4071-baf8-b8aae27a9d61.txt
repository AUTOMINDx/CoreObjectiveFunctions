Feel like a burden
I feel like a burden to everyone I interact with, my social skills aren’t the best and I don’t really know how to improve them. I can do the basics fine and I’m good with speaking about skills/activities, but outside of that I just don’t know what to do; it feels like no one I know is interested in me as a person and it’s been eating away at me. I want to meet people but don’t know where to go.

I’ve been working out and worked on taking better care of myself these past 2 years but I still feel worthless, like nobody cares. 

Any advice is welcome.
