What gift would professors appreciate and really use, given by a student?
I’m planning to give a little gift to two of my professors with whom I’ve closely worked with over the past year. I really appreciate all they’ve done and also the overall noble profession of an academic professor. They’re also providing me with a LoR for my further studies.
So, do you have any suggestions for what gift could be given to a professor?

PS: I’m thinking about gifting a book with a personal handwritten note, but not sure about which book to give. Any suggestions would be helpful!
