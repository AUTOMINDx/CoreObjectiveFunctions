My therapist fully cried in our session yesterday
So I was struggling this weekend, I was already kind of depressed but in our session last week she brought up that eventually I wouldn't need therapy anymore, and that really sent me into an abandonment spiral. Yesterday, I told her that I had that reaction, that I was feeling terribly sad at the thought of leaving therapy with her (even tho it's not happening in the near future yet), and that I was scared that she was going to forget about me when I left. She started genuinely crying and said "I will never forget you." 

It was honestly really touching and I can't stop thinking about it. I have strong transference feelings with her, I see her in a motherly way, but it feels like it's not "just" transference. I've been seeing her for four years and we have a really strong connection. I want to tell her that I love her when I see her after the holidays. Not in a romantic way, just in a...person way? It just feels like I want her to know. 

I can tell that she really cares about me, and it's wild to me. I grew up in an abusive, neglectful home, and have such a hard time believing that anyone loves me or wants me around, so it's kind of amazing that I feel so sure that she cares (except when I'm in an active depression, when my brain tells me that no one loves me and I'm completely alone). I don't even know how to express all of this, but I definitely want to tell her when I do end up leaving therapy about how much of a gift she has given me.
