Vulnerable narcissists: What did you think you had before you realized it was NPD and how did you figure it out?
I always assumed I had avoidant personality disorder, but I've never actually been officially diagnosed with anything. Recently I learned about vulnerable narcissism which is almost the same thing as AVPD pretty much, but with a few narcissistic traits sprinkled in and it looks like an even better match. I am wondering if anyone else had a similar experience. Did you think you had social anxiety or something else? Or did you always know you were narcissistic?
