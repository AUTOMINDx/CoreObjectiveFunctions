I asked my crush what he was doing friday evenening. He answered "no idea, and you?" whereas I answered I'm going to an event. Now its radio silence. Did I do this wrong?
I wrote on Snapchat asking what he was doing friday evening and he he answered "No idea, and you?" And I answered I was going to a bar event. He opened the snap but hasn't answered anything.

I have mild autism. I was expecting him saying something like "nice, have fun" or "sounds fun, can I come?" but none of that happened. 

Can I assume he isn't interested because he hasn't followed up?
