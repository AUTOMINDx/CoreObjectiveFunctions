RANT: I’m tired of being a “therapist” friend who only exists when they have issues
It’s like I’m a trauma dump bc I have nothing much going on in my own life. The only time I talk to friends now is when they text me asking for advice or ranting about their issues to me. And their stories are always usually about their other friends and their problems with them when they hang out or something. 

But they never invite me out, only use me to talk to them about their issues. I always try my best to be a good listener and help them in hopes to strengthen friendships or whatever but the moment their issues are resolved I will never hear from them again. 

When I do take the initiative to ask to hang out, they always have other plans with other people. Yet, if I don’t keep them as my friends, I will pretty much have none.
