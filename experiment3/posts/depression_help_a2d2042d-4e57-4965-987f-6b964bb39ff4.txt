it's my birthday today and im surprised and so fucking proud of myself for living for 20 years.
It's 4am right now. I turned 20 today. 

I am and was suicidal for most of the times. I feel like shit, because i feel alone right now but the fact that I have lived for so many years, struggling with trauma and abusive childhood, makes me realize that I'm strong as fuck. I cannot believe that I got to witness myself, stepping into my 20s. It's crazy. I really hope it gets better for everyone out there. It's not getting better for me, but I'm just happy that I lived for so many years. Feels like a HUGE FLEX?? haha.
