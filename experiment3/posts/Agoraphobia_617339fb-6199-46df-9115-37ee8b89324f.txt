After being housebound with anxiety for nearly 12 years, my family insists it's nothing but laziness and 'all in my head'
I have a mother who resents me because I haven't left the house in many years and she's "exhausted with me" in her own words. There's a lot of bitterness and hate between us. She's pulling the weight and I'm pulling her down by not doing anything with my life. I'm in my 30s. I was a great student until college. In college I started to struggle with social anxiety to the point it ended up destroying my life. It digressed into hiding in the restroom and skipping classes. I know why my mom is pissed. She expected a lot from me and I let her down. Lots of people expected wonderful strides from me. It shocks people who knew me as an honor student in high school. I understand my mom's point of view totally...but it also hurts to know I'm viewed as a burden to her. I'm also really embarrassed and don't want my friends and past classmates to know what happened to me. When I get messages like "What have you been up to?" I have to lie so I don't alarm anybody.

I don't know how to get out of this trap I l've gotten myself stuck in. Staying home, relying so much on my mom who can't stand me anymore, and ordering everything I need online instead of driving to get it myself has destroyed everything. I need medical care. I need dental care. I need mental health care. 

My mom is done with me. She's said all she's going to do for now on is provide food and feminine products- nothing else.

I don't know how to get better. I may never recover. I hate everything about myself and my life.
