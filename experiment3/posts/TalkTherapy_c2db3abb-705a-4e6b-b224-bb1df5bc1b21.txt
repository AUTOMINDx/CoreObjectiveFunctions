Therapist asks me where I’m feeling the emotion in my body?
Whenever I’m talking about anything bad, whether it be in that current moment, or in the past, my therapist will ask me where I feel it in my body at that moment. Half the time I don’t even feel negatively about any of it in that moment when I’m telling her. Even when I really try to think about it, unless it’s something actually affecting me right in that moment, I’m just kinda like uhhh I don’t feel it anywhere? I feel like I’ve just accepted it already or something? Maybe she thinks I’m getting upset and wants me to focus on my body? But I am fine?

The only time I’ve ever felt an emotion somewhere is in my chest, otherwise I feel like I’m just making something up or thinking about it too hard. She’ll even ask me what colors I’m thinking of sometimes. 

I feel vibrations in the center of my chest when I’m anxious or a heavy/drooping sensation when I’m deeply sad or heartbroken.. that’s as far as it goes.

Is this common? Why does she do this?

Edit/ I’m not literally “making up” where I feel an emotion, I am trying so hard to think of where I feel something, that sometimes it feels like it is placebo or I’m imagining it, not lying to her or pulling something out of nowhere necessarily, although I should just tell her this anyway
