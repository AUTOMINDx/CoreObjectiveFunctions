A share
I have been spiraling lately. Nothing happened but I have been inside of my head a few days. The year is ending, I want to achieve more things in work and in my hobby. I have been running around doing many tasks so that I can get a feeling that this year is successful as if there is some sort of a deadline. I am overly emotional and anxious. Trying to let go but I just cant. The result of all of this is less and less productivity in my day because I'm not thinking clearly. I need to take it easy but I just don't know how to.
