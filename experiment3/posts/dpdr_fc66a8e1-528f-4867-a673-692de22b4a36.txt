Consciousness is now a trigger
I’ve been dealing with DP for about 7 years and it’s now the worst it’s ever been. I know being in quarantine added to the worsening of my mental state, but if got progressively worse over the last few months. Long story short, these last few weeks I’ve been dealing with increasingly distressing intrusive thoughts. The one causing me the most anxiety and stress recently is the idea of consciousness. I really don’t know how to explain it other than being conscious freaks me out. Anyone ever deal with anything similar? I’ve been hesitant to try medication these last few years, but I felt like I had no other alternative. I started Zoloft about a week ago and I’m really hoping it provides some relief from this.
