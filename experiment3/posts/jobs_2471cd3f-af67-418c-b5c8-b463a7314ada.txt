Told boss that I wanted to end internship early. Boss offered full time job.
Hi everyone! Need some advice.

So during my internship, I received a job offer from a different company. The pay is decent and the job is in an industry that I want to be in. However, the interviewer made it clear that I will need to be prepared to work overtime. The job scope also seems to be quite limited so I'm not sure about career growth.

I decided to inform my manager that I plan to quit by this month. They were speechless but was quite nice about it. They then said they'll let the management know. So the next day, the COO video calls me. They offered me a full time job with a much higher pay (without prior knowledge of what the other job was gonna pay me). They listed down points of how my skills can come in handy in the industry I'm in and possible career advancements. They finally ended this by saying that I still want to change jobs, they'll network me and find me an interview because they feel like my skills are pretty good.

I'm not gonna lie, it sounds pretty good. The work hours are good, management is pretty great so far, I can do the work given to me. If I decide to stay, what's my next step? Should I ask about benefits etc, whether I'll start once my internship end?
