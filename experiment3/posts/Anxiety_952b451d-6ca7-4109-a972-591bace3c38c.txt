I made my doctor cry today!
And I’m utterly speechless. Today was the first time I met this doctor. I have had a nightmarish phase for the past 2 years. I have so many things going on and so much to lose. I told her my entire story and she patiently listened to me, until she broke down. 

Watching her, I couldn’t hold myself either. My eyes got misty and I tried my hardest to make sure she doesn’t see that I’m weeping too. As a 25 year old male, crying with her would have been embarrassing, that’s what I thought. 

I don’t really know what to make of it. She is a pretty well known psychiatrist with an MD and decades of experience. She patiently listened to me and prescribed me the meds that would help me battle anxiety and ADHD. She seemed really kind and compassionate, and the fact that she cried listening to my story made me realize how bad my situation really is. 

I choose not to relive my past memories since they are filled with hardships and trauma, but today I had to convey everything to her and relive my past. It was hell.

I just wanted to share this with all of you and ask if any of you had a similar experience.
