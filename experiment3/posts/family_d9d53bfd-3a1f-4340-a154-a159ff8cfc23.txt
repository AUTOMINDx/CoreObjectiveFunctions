Dad achievement
Just had to tell somebody.

I was rubbing/massaging my wife's back when my toddler approached me with a cutie to peel for her.  I was able to successfully peel it one handed (and all in one piece) without stopping my wife's back rub!

She didn't notice until I had just about finished peeling it.

Wish I'd filmed it
