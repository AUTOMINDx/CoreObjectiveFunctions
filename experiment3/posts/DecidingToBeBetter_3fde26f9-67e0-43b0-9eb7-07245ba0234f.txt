16Y/O Starting my first work day today.
I just felt like coming on here &amp; talking about how I got my first ever day at work today. 

It’s currently 8AM and I’m eating breakfast before I head to the gym before I have my first ever shift at 4PM to 10PM.  It’s crazy, I never thought I’d be working so early but I’m really tired of asking people for stuff &amp; I wanna become more independent, it feels good to take my first couple steps into adulthood even if it is a little job at Wendy’s making $9.50 a hour. 

I was really depressed &amp; lazy before, so this right here is showing that I’m really changing. I’m not that same kid anymore who couldn’t think of anything but killing himself. I can’t feel it but I know my dad is looking down on me smiling, wish me luck!
