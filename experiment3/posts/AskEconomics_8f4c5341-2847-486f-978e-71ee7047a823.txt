Hyperinflation
Ok, I buy crypto and spend A lot of time on crypto Twitter and I notice they always talk about hyperinflation is coming and it's the end of the world, and compare it to the weimer republic.

I want to ask someone that actually knows economics works because I see hyperinflation thrown around since January and I haven't seen anything crazy yet, I've seen prices increase but it's not like I'm spending $100 for a sack of potatoes.

So is this hyperinflation a reality or do we not know?
