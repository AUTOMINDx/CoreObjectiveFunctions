People don't understand I don't want to be a leader
I work in a department where my boss (dept head) is retiring in 6 months. Co-workers  have naturally assumed I'm going to be in the running for his position. I politely tell people I'm happy doing what I do and don't desire being a department head. Their response is akin to looking like they saw a three headed person. They aren't able to grasp the concept I prefer being in the role of a supporting team member.  I like to play it safe.

-I'm not a natural born leader (although I believe you don't have to be to be a successful leader)
-In previous jobs I was turned down for supervisor positions and left my ego feeling bruised, it was a hard blow.
-The dept head  role requires clarifying expectations amongst other departments/top brass and others with strong personalities. I always feel like a shrinking violet interacting with these people. I stumble and bumble. I'm not very good at delivering messages in a linear, polished manner.  
-I am uncomfortable with confrontation.  
- My boss hasn't encouraged me to consider his position. The person who he spent 2+ years  grooming  to be his replacement left due to unforseen health issues.  

- I do feel I'd be great managing what would be 4 employees that comprise our dept. I'm good at instilling morale and training others.

There's always party of me that thinks "what if", but the nagging gut-feeling of staying the course where I'm confident and comfortable keeps me where I'm at. I don't think I'd be able to take  yet another defeat.   I've learned just because someone's good at their job, doesn't  mean they possess the skills to lead.  Any advice?
