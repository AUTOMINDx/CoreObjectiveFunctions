What do you do when your mental health makes it hard to schedule appointments?
I find that when my mental illness is especially bad I can't seem to schedule appointments to see my therapist (or psychiatrist)

It's so many things combined: I don't have the motivation to do anything, I feel hopeless so I feel like there's no point, I get bad dissociation so logistically scheduling or anything to do with time feels very confusing...

I know it's not my T's responsibility to remind me to make appointments. So are there any ways you've worked out to address this in the past? Even right now I know I'm not in a great place and should probably schedule an appointment but it feels so complicated that I don't know how
