The oldest profession
I've often heard of prostitution as the oldest profession or the first profession. Which makes me wonder how far back can we identify prostitution in cultures as a means of making up a significant portion of one's income (if be it through a pimp or some other authoritative figure)? Was is it something that starting appearing with the rise of large permanent settlements? There is [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663035/) to suggest that our closest evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees, practice a form of prostitution using valuable food as currency. So, would dedicated prostitution be even older than that stage in our development?
