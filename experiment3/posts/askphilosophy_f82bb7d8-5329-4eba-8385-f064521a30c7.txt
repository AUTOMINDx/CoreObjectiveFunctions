Should I believe in Pascal’s Wager?
I have read through several articles and websites regarding Pascal’s Wager and whether or not it is logical. Many sources claim it to be fallacious. I am pretty young, and am just on the tip of the iceberg when it comes to philosophy. I was raised in a predominantly christian household, and the fear of going to hell is pulverizing, despite it likely not being real. I forget where the term came to me, but Pascal’s Wager seemed logical to me at first. It seems fatuous now but I don’t want a doomed eternity. Upon further glance some rethinking must be involved.  I must remind you I am still forming opinions on my own philosophy and way of thinking, so please do not judge. I don’t have anyone in my real life I could speak to about this, so, tell me, should I believe Pascal’s Wager?
