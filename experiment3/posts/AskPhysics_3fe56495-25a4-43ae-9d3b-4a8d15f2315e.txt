Why is it not obvious that the future is predetermined? Where are the flaws in my logic?
Imagine a universe with only one ‘object’ and one force acting on it, nothing else exists. At the point of inception in this universe, you know everything about the force and the ‘object’. Therefore, you must know exactly how the object will act at a point directly after inception. You can repeat this process moving forwards snapshot to snapshot in time,and therefore know every future state of this universe. Every state is predetermined.

Why does this logic not apply to our universe? Is it not obvious that everything must surely be predetermined, as this universe is no different than the other only vastly more complex?

Appreciate anyone who could point out the flaws in this. Warning, I’m fairly shit at physics.
