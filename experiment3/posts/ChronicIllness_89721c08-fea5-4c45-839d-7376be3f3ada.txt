Anyone else find that people don't believe them, because "no one so young can have that much wrong with them"?
I'm 17 and have a fair few ilnessess/conditions (all of which are diagnosed by a doctor):
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Chronic daily migraine
- Trigeminal neuralgia
- Sensory processing disorder
- Visual snow syndrome
- PTSD
- Depression

Today, one of my friends at school ask why I take so many days off sick (my attendance is like 80% or something), so I told them about all this. Their response?

"No one so young can have that much wrong with them. Why are you lying about all this? Maybe you just have Munchhausens instead".

Does anyone else ever get told stuff like this?
