Gravity and the second law of thermodynamics
How does the effect of gravitational pull not break the second law of thermodynamics? Disordered clouds of dust or gas in space will come together into a planet or a star given enough time. How does this process not decrease the net amount of entropy? Where in this process is disorder increased to balance the decrease from the formation of a planet from dust?
