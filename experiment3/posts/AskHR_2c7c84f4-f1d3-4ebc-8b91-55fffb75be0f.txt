[MD] Boss lied about vaccination status
My boss told our office in June that he received the COVID vaccine and then walked around without a mask. During several meetings he would tell people "it's Ok, I'm fully vaccinated" and then would take off his mask and sit right next to someone. Our vaccine mandate just went into effect and turns out he is being told to stay home and telework until he gets the vaccine. Forcing him to telework doesn't really seem like much of a punishment but the real issue several of us employees are having is that he lied about his vaccination status to us. It ruins our trust in him and gave us a false sense of security when it turns out we weren't in the safe work place we thought we were in. Is there anything we can do? Thank you all.
