Home is where the indifference is
I'm home for the holidays and struggling, even though it's only been three days. 

Usually around this time of year I come home ready to be on holiday, ready to unwind for the new year. Unfortunately this time I've had lingering projects that won't allow me to take my usual leave. So I've brought my work stress to my family home, which is already an anxiety-riddled environment. Basically, compounded stress and worry, which is super shit. 

In this short time I've been home I've experienced such gaslighting and invalidating behavior from my parents. One night I worked until 10:30pm. I wake up the next morning, very tired still, and relay this to my Dad. His response? 10:30 isn't even late. Your mother stays up working until 1am. 

They don't ask what's happening in my life. The TV is always on. When we do talk they're barely paying attention. My Dad will literally change the subject in the middle of me talking because something else has caught his attention. Social interaction feels so awkward, which is so weird, because I don't know how I survived living in this house for 20+ years. 

When I'm here I feel myself getting smaller and smaller. I know they love me, but they have no clue about how to show it. It feels like I may as well be somewhere else. It feels like I'm just some distant relative spending time with almost strangers. After years of therapy, ups and downs of feeling sad, angry, furious, neutral, I'm still flummoxed by this all. 

The major relief I have is knowing that this is not my day to day life. This is not the life I've built â€“ this is their life, their mess. Ive worked so hard to create a gentle, compassionate life, where I can live without constant judgement. I have to keep reminding myself this because I otherwise lose touch with reality.
