(22 F) Why does every guy my age want a threesome?? God it’s so fucking annoying! Men please share why you think that’s fun or attractive?!
If one more guy asks me I might snap. A guy I’ve been talking to for a month asked me about myself and a friend last night; while ex boyfriends have brought it up in the past. To this recent guy, I said, “what if that was me asking about your friend” and he immediately said sorry. SO…….. why do so many guys want it, yet wouldn’t be cool with reversing the role? I don’t even want to but it makes more sense thinking about it that way.

Edit: Damn this blew up. Lol. I was not trying to shame people for liking that stuff. Just trying to get some insight into the male mind :)

Another edit: He knows I’ve been cheated on before. That I’m very loyal in nature. Said he DOESN’T care about sex that much. Seemed like a very normal guy. 10/10 was just completely shocked he’d ask after all that we talked about.
