ok so im a girl and im afraid to go onto ingame voicechat.
some dudes (not all) really out here being so goddam sexist. They be roasting me purely on the fact that i am of the female species.

So how do i roast them back? i got some ideas like

You are the most beta dude i have ever met.  
Something calling the person a "basement dwelling slug"

Something about dad going to get the milk...

idk i need more ideas.
