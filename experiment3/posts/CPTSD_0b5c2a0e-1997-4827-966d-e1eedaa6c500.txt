I hate that my life was ruined before I even knew what being alive meant.
My first encounter with CSA started as a toddler. Maybe even before that, I can't tell. It went until I was eleven or twelve. Those years were intermingled with a dysfunctional family's toxic emotional and psychological abuse, and bullying, and my own fears and mental health spiraling.

No fucking wonder I find life to be a nightmarish chore.

...Man. I'm tired.
