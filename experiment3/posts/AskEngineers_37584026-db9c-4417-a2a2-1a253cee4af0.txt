Why do companies do not post prices of their products?
I am currently an engineering student and designing a powerplant. Part of it is an economic analysis where I need prices for equipments like turbines, boilers, pumps, heat exchangers, etc. I've been searching for prices of these equipments for weeks now and yet i haven't found a single "sure" price. How can I find information regarding this or even cost estimates?
