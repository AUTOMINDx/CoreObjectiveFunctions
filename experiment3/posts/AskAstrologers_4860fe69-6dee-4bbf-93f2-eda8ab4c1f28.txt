Any Virgo moons feel like they were the parent in their household as a kid?
My mom is a Pisces sun Aries moon and she often behaved as a child when I was younger. From being emotionally immature to literally whining. I had to grow up so fast because there was no parental figure present in my life. Anyone else?
