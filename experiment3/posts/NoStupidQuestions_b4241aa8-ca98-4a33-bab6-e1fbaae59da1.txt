What should I do while the furnace guy is here?
It's so awkward having someone at my house to fix or work on anything. I feel like I should be doing something.  I'm not going to sit there and make small talk with the poor guy.  

This has been over 30 years of awkwardness for me.  I've never known what I should be doing. 

It's winter, so it's not like I can pretend to be busy by pruning my bushes.  

Oh, and it's Christmas Eve day.  I think I'll fake baking something so I don't look like a loser without plans.

EDIT: Cookies are done.  Thank you for the godl award!

 Also, the 30 years is a accumulation of any types of service people coming to work on anything at my house.  I stay out of their way 100%.  I still feel anxiety though, as I have PTSD and am a single female. 

Merry Christmas everyone and thank you for all the input!

**Last Edit**   Furnace guy did not come.  F.
