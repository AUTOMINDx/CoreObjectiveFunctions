Does randomness have explanatory power?
As a quick example, very often in a debate between an atheist and a theist you will hear one side saying "X was done by God", and the other side "It's more likely X just happened by chance". I was curious about whether randomness has a good explanatory power, is randomness itself a *cause* or something like that, do we explain anything by randomness in our world?
