I can't feel love.
I both can't feel love coming from other people and don't feel love for other people. In my opinion this absolutely stems from my emotional neglect â€” I had a single father and he never told me he loved me or validated me or was able to pay attention to my emotional needs. He also never hugged me unless I
hugged him first. I think he just didn't know how to show affection. And while I *knew* he loved me, I never *felt* it. I also never felt it from anyone else in my life.

And now that I'm older I've realized I can't really feel love for other people or feel it when they have love for me? I can't feel my friends' love for me and I don't feel love for them even though I appreciate them and am glad they're around and would be very upset if they left. I just can't seem to access the feeling of love. I do think it's a thing I would be able to eventually feel when I work through my trauma but it really sucks now. I do feel love for animals, just not people.

Has anyone else struggled with feeling loved by other people or loving other people?
