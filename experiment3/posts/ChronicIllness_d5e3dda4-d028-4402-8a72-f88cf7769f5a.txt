Rant/Vent - A divorce due to illness…
My husband of 4 years and partner of 8, has asked for a divorce because he cannot handle the tension of my SLE and nutcracker syndrome even though he knew about it before we even started seriously dating. My last long term relationship before him ended partially for the same reason so I was completely upfront and honest about it, that I require frequent hospitalizations, doctor visits, etc. and he said he could handle it, that I was more than just my illness, and that I was worth it. I am still able to drive as well as take care of myself but apparently he cannot stand the “tension” that my health causes him. I honestly am feeling completely hopeless right now. Is this something that happens a lot or am I just unlucky enough to have found two partners that seem to ignore the is sickness and in health part of their vows?
