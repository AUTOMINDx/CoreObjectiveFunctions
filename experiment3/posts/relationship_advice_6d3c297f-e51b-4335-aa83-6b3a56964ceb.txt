Is my (F28) boyfriend (M26) a hypocrite? He likes other women’s pictures but doesn’t like when I post.
So my boyfriend does not like when I post “sexy” pictures of myself on Instagram. They are never too revealing. I like taking artful nudes where the majority of my body is covered with my hair (I have extremely long and thick hair) I see it as art. I make sure to cover up my private bits. 

Now the kicker is that my boyfriend goes around liking sexy pictures of other women that are far far more revealing than the pictures I post. And not like they are random girls; they are girls from around the area. I don’t care what he likes; I care about the hypocrisy. 

I brought this up to him saying that it’s hypocritical if he’s going to like other women’s bikini, boobie-centric, and borderline pornographic photos while trying to control what I post. 

Do i have the right to feel this way?
