Is there merit to the claim that inflation is not caused by a supply chain crunch, but instead the result of companies taking larger profits?
I’ve seen at argued that inflation isn’t caused by a supply chain crunch at all, and instead is happening because companies are increasing prices in order to make more profit.

If this is true, then what is allowing these companies to raise prices without being undercut that wasn’t present before?

If this is untrue, then why are companies able to make more money than ever despite the supply crunch?
