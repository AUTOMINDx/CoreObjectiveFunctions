The energy was bad but not it’s not anyone notice this shift
It seemed for awhile the energy was bad from November to a couple days ago and now starting yesterday it shifted more positively arguably this is probably one of the more positive energy shifts I’ve felt since at least those couple weeks in May I know Venus is conjoining Pluto but right now it feels slightly refreshing hmm anyone else feeling some better vibes right now ??
