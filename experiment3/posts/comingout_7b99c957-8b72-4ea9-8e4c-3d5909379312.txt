Just Came Out to My Friend!!!!!
I have been talking to my therapist and one of my friends about struggling with gender and sexuality for a while now. I officially came out to my therapist like 2 weeks ago and I just came out to my friend! 

They are both so supportive and reacted so much better than I could have thought in my irrational lizard brain!
