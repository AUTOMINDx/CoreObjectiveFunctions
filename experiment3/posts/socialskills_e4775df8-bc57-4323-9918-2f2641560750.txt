Do girls go for men a couple inches shorter than them?
I was at the mall buying some things and I saw this really pretty girl and she saw me, I wasn’t interested by reflex because she was taller than me and I know how this works (it’s a fucked up world) anyways I caught her staring at me several times and she was sending clear signs for me to approach her, but I didn’t cause I thought I was misinterpreting all this situation because girls always go for guys that are at least 6’ and I’m a 5’5” short fuck haha anyways I find it kinda hot when a girl’s taller than me now that I think about it.

Edit: whoa I didn’t expect too many replies, I’m reading you, thanks to all of you for your advices. I’ll go for it next time!
