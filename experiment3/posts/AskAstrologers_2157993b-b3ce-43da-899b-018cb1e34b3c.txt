A lot of famous artists have Chiron in their 5th house
John Lennon, Courtney Love, Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, etc.. You can find the list on Astro-seek using the “celebrity astro search engine”

I’m really bad at putting things into words so I also got a quote from Astro-seek about Chiron in the 5th and it says:

“Whether these people create - a piece of art, a novel, a scientific text, or start a business - it is not accepted by others with recognition that they believe they deserve. There is always some defect: it is out of date, it is prejudiced or it does not attract enough attention. The more unique and distinctive are the fruits of their creativity, the more painful is their trauma of rejection.”

So how is it that these famous artists have found success/recognition with Chiron in their 5th?
