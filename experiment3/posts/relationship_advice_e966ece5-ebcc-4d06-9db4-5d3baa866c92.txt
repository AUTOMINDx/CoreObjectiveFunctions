(15m) My friend got a gf and is now a complete asshole
A guy I’ve been pretty much best friends with at school for 4 years got a girlfriend a couple of months ago, and the way he treats me has completely changed. He always puts me down in front of her for no reason, makes comments about my appearance, gets pissy at me about the smallest things, like me playing guitar if she’s with us, and rips on me for everything, but only in front of her. 

Last week, he told me to meet him at the music rooms in school during lunch, so I went there and waited for him, but I saw him walk down the corridor, ghost me completely and walk the other way, so I went up to him and asked him what his problem with me was. He told me to piss off and leave him and his girlfriend alone, and I said that he told me to meet him there, and he said “no, I told you to piss off,” why is he being so two-faced and obnoxious? They hang out with other girls at lunch, so he clearly doesn’t mind if other people are with them, but he doesn’t want me there. I would respect if they wanted privacy, but they clearly don’t, since they’re around other people. 

It’s not even as if his relationship with me and his gf are mutually exclusive. 

TL;DR Why is he acting this way? Should I cut him off?
