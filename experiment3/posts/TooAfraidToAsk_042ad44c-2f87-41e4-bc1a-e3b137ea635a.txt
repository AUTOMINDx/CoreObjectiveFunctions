People with a vagina: while peeing do you sometimes press on your clitoral hood and pretend you're one of those soda dispensers at fast food restaurants and your pee is lemonade?
I sometimes pretend while I'm peeing that my body is dispensing lemonade from one of those soda machines where you press the buttons to get your drink.

I know this is super specific but I have to know if I'm the only one  who made this weird mental connection. It's not sexual, just a joke (I wasn't sure what to tag it other than nsfw).

Edit: I realize I didn't specify that I am a cis woman.

Edit: wow there are some real transphobes here. To clarify because I will die on this hill: not all women have vaginas and not all people with a vagina are women. Trans people are valid.
