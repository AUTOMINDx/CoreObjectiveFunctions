My self hatred has reached another level
Throwaway account.

Basically, I got scammed. And I'm blaming myself because all of the facts say I consented, because they don't have access to my brain. I've been anxious for a week, losing sleep and appetite. I've relapsed into thinking about doing bad things to myself. I concluded that I hate myself for bringing this upon me, because I'm too nice and too polite and also, too stupid. I'm trying to find a way to fix the scam issue, but the mental impact it has already done, killed me inside.

I just want it to be over with. I don't know what to do or who to run to, because I feel like I betrayed myself.
