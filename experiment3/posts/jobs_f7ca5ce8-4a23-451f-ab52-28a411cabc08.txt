The workers shortage is everywhere - yet Ghosting is rampant and went through the roof
Everyone complains about the "workers shortage". If such a shortage should really exist - why the hell is Ghosting rampant - having gone through the roof since Corona? 

A whopping 77% of job seekers say they’ve been ghosted by a prospective employer since the U.S. onset of the pandemic last March, with 10%  reporting that an employer has ghosted them even after a verbal job  offer was made.  Only 27% of employers say they *haven’t* ghosted a job seeker in the past year.

Sure some job seekers do Ghost companies as well - not showing up for the interview - just dissappearing ect However employers are ghosting much more frequently than job seekers. They are awfully picky for an economy that is supposedly going through a "workers shortage" huh?
