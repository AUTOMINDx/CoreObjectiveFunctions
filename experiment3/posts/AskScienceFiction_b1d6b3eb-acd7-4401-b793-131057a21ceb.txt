[DC Comics] What exactly makes Superman the strongest in the league and how is he able to defeat the rest of the justice league by himself when you have people like MM and WM or Super girl and Power girl not to mention Orion who are a match for him even at "full power" and also ganging up on him?
like him "holding back" shouldn't mean his full power is somehow magically stronger than people of the near the same/comparable  ,the exact same, or far more power than him. Hell WM alone has shown better feats against him by herself but all of sudden her and like 4 other powerhouses can't take superman at "full power"???
