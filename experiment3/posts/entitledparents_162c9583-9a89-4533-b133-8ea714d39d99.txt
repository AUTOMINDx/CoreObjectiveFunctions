Entitled parent demanded that I cancel my plans for her
Hi guys this is a latest story that had happened, characters; me , my mum , entitled parent.
One day me and my mum booked tickets to movies and we were getting ready to leave ,at that time EP called me , and just told me to get ready and she is coming to pick me up to babysit her children (EP kids).  I  was like no, I am not coming , I have my plans for today.
EP said me to cancel my plan and to come babysit HER CHILDREN. I again refused .Me , my mum and with our friends we got into the movie theatre.
Ep, was so mad at me and EP called me again while I was getting popcorn , EP again said to come back to babysit.or else she will call the cops. My mum said her to do the deed and ended the call.


Edit : thanks for the awards and response guys
 
Some of you have asked what happened after that, hereâ€™s the story EP away smart enough not to call cops she just used it as a threat to make me come. I just switched off my phone and carried on with my life.
And had clearly said to EP that I was not her babysitter and I just helped her by baby sitting her kids for just 2 days.
 I know this was not the update you have expected.
