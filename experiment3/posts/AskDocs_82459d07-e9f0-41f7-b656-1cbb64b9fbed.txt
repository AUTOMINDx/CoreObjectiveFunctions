Glioblastoma 100% removal survival timeline 65f
My best friends mom just had a glioblastoma tumor removed from her brain. The doctor said it wasnâ€™t in the traditional octopus shape that it normally is and was able to removed 100% of the tumor (just checked via MRI). 

My question is if they did indeed get all of the tumor, what is her survival timeline? I know glioblastoma is very very serious.
