Now is your best time to recover and rest.
With the holidays rolling in, people are putting out their "out of office" email responses and settling down with family or friends for the festivities. **This is your best chance to recover to be more energetic and motivated for 2022**. Here are three tips on how to get the most out of the holidays so you will be more ready for next year than ever!

1. **Focus on keeping your habits after the holidays**:  With the holiday break pausing your routine of working out, reading a  book or eating healthy, it's good to pay attention to the days that come  after: The quicker you get back on your habit, the more likely it is to stick.
2. **Stay consistent by doing less**: Making a "lite" version of your habit is a great way to make sure  you'll be doing it even in January. Tend to read for 60 minute daily but don't have the time for it on the holidays? Go for 15 minutes every  evening instead.
3. **Recovery is insanely productive**:  No one can stay productive and work on their projects, businesses, or careers indefinitely: Be efficient and rest because you need and deserve  it. This holiday, pick up your favorite hobby again and leave your worries at the door.
