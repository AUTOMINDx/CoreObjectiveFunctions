my entitled family wanted me to use my make Awish on them
note: this was when I was 8 years old. 

I was born with brain damage, because of this I have a lot of heath problem. when I was 8 my health decline quickly and the doctor did not think, I would live to the end of the year. make a wish got in contact with my mom and she told me, the rest of my dad side of the family found out quickly and start to get excited about going to Disney (I chose meeting the actor of Draco from Harry Potter) when I told my family I did not want to go to Disney, because there was nothing for me to do, I can't ride roller costar and I don't like Disney princess or character.

But they did not care, I could not go a day without hearing "your sisters always wanted to go to Disney world, and you are robbing them of it" or " you are our sister you are a post to love us" only one of my sisters was sad I was dying. or this one my favorite "you are going to die anyway what do it mater, let your sister have this, you are going to be on your death bed wonder why everyone hate you" 

It became too much, watching my mother cry holding me and feeling my other family hate me. so, I told my mom that the wish should go to some one that can use it for what they want to not their family. 

My family made themself the victims and for a couple years after this they would tell me "They hate me and how they wish I die" but then when I start to become successful. they start to love me, but I ignore them, working on moving out and cutting contact with them but for the family that I know love me.
