How much of an impact does being fired have on future job opportunities?
I'm a college grad  who's been employed for about 3 years now. I've had 2 jobs. I had my first job for about 2 years and I felt like I did a good job at it. I've had my current job for about a year and feel like I perform pretty poorly at it. I would be pretty surprised if my current employer didn't fire me within a year. I feel like the reason why I perform poorly at it is because I chose it mainly for money.

My first and 2nd jobs are pretty different industries in my opinion. My first job is a Support Analyst and my 2nd job is a Software Developer.

I was just curious to know how much of an impact it would have on my career if I walk into work one day and I'm told I'm fired. My career goal is not to be a Software Developer. So maybe it doesn't matter that much then I'm assuming.
