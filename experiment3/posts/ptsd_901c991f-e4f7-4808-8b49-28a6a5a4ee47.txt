I need to talk. I want to talk. But I can’t.
I’ve been feeling like I really need to talk to someone because it’s all just building up inside me. But every time I try to say something my body just shuts down like ‘haha nice try’ 
It’s too overwhelming like I physically can’t say what I’m dying to say. It just won’t come out. 

And also I’m terrified of people seeing me as having a victim mentality. Like I question whether I am making it up or if I have a right to feel like a victim. 

Anyway I’m currently dealing with a lot of intense negative emotions relating to the event and I can’t tell anyone anything because my freaking body just shuts down 

Very frustrating. Its so much to carry
