Should we seek ER care for husband (30m) with excruciating body pain likely COVID positive?
30 m husband almost definitely has COVID (see below). He was double vaccinated by April 2021 no booster yet. His fever is 102.5 while on alternating doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen every four hours. He is in near tears from the body pain, shivering, alternating feeling overheated and chilled, disoriented and terrified. He has an extremely high tolerance for pain (I.e broke foot didn’t even flinch, walked on it a mile and drove self another 15 miles not even a hint that he was in pain) so I am extremely worried about him. He can’t even handle fabric on him right now. His breathing is rapid much like with a fever.

For background there’s an outbreak at my work which is also my 7 year olds school. 7 yo tested positive on rapid antigen we were only given one test. 30m husband, myself (36f) and 18month old child all have been symptomatic but cannot get tested PCR until tomorrow and results are taking up to a week right now.

Thanks in advance
