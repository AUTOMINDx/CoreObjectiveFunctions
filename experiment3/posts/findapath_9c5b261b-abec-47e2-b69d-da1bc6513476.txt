IAMA professional resume writer &amp; career consultant who, out of holiday spirit, will rewrite job descriptions for free in this thread to those who are seeking help. (Part II)
Hi all,

I am a [**professional resume writer and career consultant**](https://danielcatalan.com/) who has been serving the Reddit community diligently for the last two years. The big break in my own career came from hosting [**an AMA that made it to the front page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ia5oxr/iama_writer_specializing_in_career_services_i/) in August 2020, which I [**followed up on**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/oeuc74/iama_cvresume_writer_living_abroad_in_portugal_i/) in June 2021.

I am grateful for everything Reddit has done for me, and I try to pay forward my gratitude whenever I can. [**Last year on Christmas Eve, I hosted a thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/kk2fux/iama_professional_resume_writer_career_consultant/) where I volunteered to rewrite segments of Redditors' resumes pro-bono and I felt compelled to do so again. I am caught up on work for the first time in ages and I enjoy giving back and feeling useful.

**To anyone who sees this thread and wants components of their resumes (NOT their entire resumes) rewritten professionally, copy and paste segments of your resumes into this thread and I will respond to your comments by rewriting the texts in an actionized format.** Much love, and happy holidays.

**NOTE:** Whenever I give away such freebies, they are for a limited time because doing this is my full-time job. Please do not contact me in weeks or months asking me to help you for free.
