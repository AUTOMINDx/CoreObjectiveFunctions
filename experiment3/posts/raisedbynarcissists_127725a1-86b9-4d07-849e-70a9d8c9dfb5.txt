my mom said those special, nine little words today!
“no one will ever love you like i do.” And here I thought it was a narc urban legend! 😂

edit: thank you guys for sharing your stories with me 💕💕💕 I’ve had a really hard time this holiday, and I love knowing that I have a little family here. I love you all so much!!!! ❤️
