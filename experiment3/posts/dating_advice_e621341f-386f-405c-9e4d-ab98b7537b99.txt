What did I do wrong?
My co worker and I have been talking daily for 3 months mostly initiated by her. She’s cried on the phone and we’ve talked about everything. We’ve hung out twice and slept in bed together twice and even got a hotel together with friends and her and I shared our own room. After that night she hasn’t talked to me until now and said we’re just co workers and not friends and that we don’t need to talk daily. She’s extremely bitter. We’ve only cuddled in bed, nothing more. So apparently we’re just “co workers”?? I don’t get it..
