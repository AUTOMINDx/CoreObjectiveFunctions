What would happen to the families of the Ottoman princes after they were murdered by the new Sultan?
After the death of an Ottoman Sultan, I understand that there would be a succession crisis resulting in one of the Sultan's sons inheriting the throne, and the rest of them being executed. But what would happen to the families of the sons who were executed? I'm sure they all had children, wives, probably a living mother, sisters. I assume that any of their male descendants would be executed, but I'm not sure what would happen to the women. Would they be spared? If so, what would their lives be like after?
