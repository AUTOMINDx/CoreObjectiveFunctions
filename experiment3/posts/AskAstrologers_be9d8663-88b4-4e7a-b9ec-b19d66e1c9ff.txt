An astrologer told me something very disheartening
I had my first in person, long astrology reading done the other day. This guy had been recommended to me as a great astrologer. My main dream in life and something I’ve always felt deep in my heart that is for me has been relocating to one country I love. I had spent my entire life feeling like I belong there, went there for 1.5 years and all of my assumptions came true. I felt at home. I had to leave because I didn’t have the financial means or anyone there and my visa ended and with the type of visa it was I couldn’t have extended it. I was leaving knowing I’d eventually be back. Not knowing how though. So now Im back in my home country and I asked the astrologer if I ever move back there and he said NO. He said that someone from there will come to me though. I cant accept that faith. Im a very happy, rarely anxious person who usually doesn’t see problems and accepts everything life gives me and I’m grateful for everything I get to live through. This entire experience made me realise that if I don’t eventually relocate, I really
don’t see a point in life. I feel alien in my home country and I’ve traveled to around 15 countries and there is only one place where I want to be. yet he said its not in the cards for me. Does anyone have any input on this
