Partner of 6 years has been cheating on me for 5 months
I don't have anymore words to say about it

Her and I talked for maybe 4 hours, I was texting a friend for that long as well, and then I texted another friend about what happened after

I've already said so much about it, I'm tired, I just want to sleep

I just think that the reason it hit so hard was because  I live in a fantasy most of the time, so something so real happening so fast just really felt like a punch to the face

I know most of you guys won't be able to empathize with me, but I could use some sympathy and some compassion before I pass out from exhaustion (it's early in the morning for me rn)
