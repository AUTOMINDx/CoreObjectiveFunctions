Have any of you gotten a PhD even when it didn't make sense economically?
I am currently a master's student in a thesis based program. In my field, (I think) a person with a master's degree earn around the same wage as a person with a PhD. I know I don't want to stay in academia, but I would really enjoy doing a PhD. I'm loving the research that I'm doing and want to go deeper into it. Also, since there's still some COVID restrictions at my university, I don't feel like I'm really getting the 'grad school' experience right now, so I wouldn't mind staying longer to experience that. 

Have any of you decided to get a PhD even when it didn't make sense economically and you weren't aiming to become a professor? 

My field is robotics and AI, so if anyone wants to give me advice related to my field specifically, I'd really appreciate it!
