How to tell if she just wants $$?
I'm FA and never had a gf before. Recently tried an app. So I matched with this girl much younger and better-looking than me. (I only have 1 other match, but she wasn't interested.) Chat was going pretty slow at first, but not completely dead. A few days in, I mentioned I ordered my dad a christmas present (very pricey item). And it seemed like we were chatting more. We still haven't met up because she says she's broke (but yet meets up with friends almost every day). Of course I offered to pay for dinners etc, but she's still too busy to meet up. We are only 5-10min apart. She sends pics of herself, some sexts, kissy emoticons, and says she wants to be a sugar baby. Of course I'm not so dumb as to believe she's actually into me, but I'm not sure what is it she wants. Everyone one else just ghosts me, she is the only one to actually pay me any attention (albeit sporadic).
