Crappy Childhood Fairy Critique
There's a bunch of posts on the subreddit that have talked about this YT channels en courses. Here's my thoughts:

While the information can be helpful to a degree I'm turned off by Anna Runkle's brand and platform.

Presenting oneself as the "Fairy" who can solve all your problems in simple ways for a several hundred dollar course, from someone who is not a licensed therapist is dangerous. 

Coming from a background of an authoritarian Christian upbringing I see the danger in someone claiming they have THE truth and THE solution. You're not allowed to think or question for yourself in these settings. 

I'll take what's best and leave the rest from this YT channel, working with my therapist, and focus on content from licensed therapists to discover what works for ME. That's where the growth and empowerment happens.

EDIT: Wow! I never expected this post to blow up like this. Its been helpful for me during a rough day. Thanks to everyone for you opinions and comments. And extra big thanks to folks who gave awards (my first two on Reddit!). I hope you all continue in your healing and that this subreddit may aid you in doing so!
