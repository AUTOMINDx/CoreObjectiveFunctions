Do we have any evidence (or educated conjecture) about when or why people started changing clothes for sleep?
I assume pajamas are not universal across cultures today. Of course, even in cultures where pajamas are common, some people sleep naked or in their underclothes. Other people wear clothing that could be worn during the day and viewed as daytime clothing—for example, sweatpants—but nonetheless do change clothes before sleeping. I guess I’m most interested in the concept of changing one’s clothing to prepare for sleep rather than the development of distinct features of sleeping clothes.
