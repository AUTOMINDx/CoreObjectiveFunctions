How did high rates of parental PTSD impact the Baby-Boomer generation?
Many baby boomers were raised by fathers who were part of the greatest generation that fought in World War II or the silent generation that fought in the Korean War.  Given that so many men of these generations saw combat, it is likely that many of them had PTSD.  How did this impact the upbringing of their children, the baby boomers?

Has there been any studies of this question?  Or are there any generally recognized trends and effects from it?
