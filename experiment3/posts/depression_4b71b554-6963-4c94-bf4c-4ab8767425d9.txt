Depression and weed
Okay this is really random but I just want to know others feel the same way. 
I feel like ive been dealing with depression for about a year. And I use weed to cope with my mental health issues. And I love how weed makes me feel. I love how showers feel, how movies just seem way funnier and fun to watch. I love everything about it. But I feel like Iâ€™m still sad. I feel like Iâ€™m using weed as a way to feel better but I hate that Iâ€™m always high. Idk if that makes sense. I hate that I have to smoke to feel normal, happy motivated. Itâ€™s like I love weed I hate that Iâ€™m still struggling with something and I have no idea how to fix it. 
I sound crazy

EDIT: I appreciate every single person who commented. Itâ€™s a struggle but weâ€™re not alone and I appreciate all the kindness and empathy. I donâ€™t know how to really use Reddit but itâ€™s refreshing getting to hear from nice people ðŸ’“
