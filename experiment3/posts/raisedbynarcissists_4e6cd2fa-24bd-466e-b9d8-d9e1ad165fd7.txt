The Dog Had an Accident
I did not demand that my child clean it up.

I did not threaten to get rid of the dog.

Nobody screamed. Nobody cried. It won't be mentioned again. 

Neither nature or nurture could turn me into my parents. Thank god.

Funny how these little moments can put so much into perspective, isn't it?

I'm gonna go pet our dog.
