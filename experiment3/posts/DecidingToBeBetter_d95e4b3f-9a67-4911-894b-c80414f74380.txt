I'm up! After months of oversleeping I've finally got up on time.
So I finally woke up round 6am and got up to do stuff. It's been a goal of mine for awhile in my situation but luckily have vitamins and hate on my side to motivate me, don't want to be an emotional bch no longer.

Edit: Holy cow thank you to the kind redditor for my first silver medal, glad my post inspired some others that much!
2nd Edit: Holy shit you guys are too kind! You guys give me even more motivation to keep going and pursue my goals, I'm glad I could help all of you!
