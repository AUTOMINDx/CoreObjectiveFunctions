Please help
For context, I’m a teenage, bisexual guy, at the age of 16, almost 17. My boyfriend is a year older and almost 18. I just came out to my mother as bisexual. So I was on FaceTime with my boyfriend, and my mother had come in like 30 mins prior to say she was laying down in bed. Naturally, I figured the coast was clear. However, she ended up walking into the room and inquiring as to who I was talking to, with a very worried look on her face. She looked very upset, and I explained that it was just a friend from school. She asked if the guy I was on the phone with was my boyfriend, and I told her no since I wouldn’t have a boyfriend. She then began to inquire about whether or not I had a boyfriend or a girlfriend, and if I would tell her if I would. I simply told her I didn’t and I would. But she looked very upset when I inquired why she said she thought I had been untruthful with her recently. I was not in a position to really tell or want to tell my mother about my sexuality, but she was on the verge of tears. I tried to comfort her but nothing worked. So, I went with her to the living room and tried to tell her. Basically, I sat there sobbing for about 40 mins before mustering up the courage to tell her. When I did, she was very accepting, but did say she was afraid for me and how hard my future might be. She did promise not tell anyone else though. We would spend the next 15 mins talking about it, but I couldn’t help but feel awful. I didn’t want to come out to her but I felt like I didn’t have any choice. I don’t know what to do please someone help and give me advice I hate myself right now and I don’t know what to do I’m freaking out please help someone. At this point I’m beating myself up mentally so much about it rn I’m hating myself for being bi and wishing I wasn’t this way. Please someone help
