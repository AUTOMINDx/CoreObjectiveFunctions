mom tried to kill my family
hi so this is kinda an update from my previous posts about the intervention i had with my dad (the “complacent parent”). following the intervention, he started to take a more active stance on her leaving. when threatened to leave, my mom went on a massive binge. she drank a liter of alcohol and started threatening my family with a knife. 

my dad was pushed to call the cops for the first time and they put her under a 5150 hold (involuntary psychiatric hold). im in shock and almost relieved it happened this way. this really seals the deal that she’s going to leave permanently.
