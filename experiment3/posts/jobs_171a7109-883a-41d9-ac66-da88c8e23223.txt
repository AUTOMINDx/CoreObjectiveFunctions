I hate cover letters and it’s a massive waste of time
It can take me more than an hour to create a cover letter. I have a template, but I’m editing it each time I apply somewhere to answers the company’s questions or my experience in what they are looking for.

It slow down my search process for what? Getting rejected.

For real, I spend days working hard to make a  great cover letter for nothing.
