Spend some time "sitting with my feelings" and now feeling emotional and exhausted
I've been reading "running on empty" by Jonice Webb and in the book she suggests spending time sitting with your feelings and trying to determine what you are feeling. 

I did that today and felt some very strong emotions and physical sensations. 

I also did an exercise which is supposed to release trauma trapped in your vagal nerve. (You lie flat on a bed or matt, put your hands behind your head and while keeping your head straight turn your eyes to look far left or right for about 90 seconds, then to switch sides and look the other way)

Anyways just wanted to randomly share this with people who may understand. 

I also realised how much focus it took to keep myself occupied on exploring and experiencing the unpleasant emotions and not jumping back on my smartphone or inventing some household chore that needed my urgent attention. 

Still feeling somewhat emotional and worn out from it
