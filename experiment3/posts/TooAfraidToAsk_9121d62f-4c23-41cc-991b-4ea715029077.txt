Do I need to shave my vagina?
I never have before. And honestly I’ve never given it much thought before. Before I have sex with a guy is it better to shave?? I already know it’s not necessary but is it better? Or expected?

Edit: I KNOW it’s the vulva that I would shave if anything and not my vagina. I do anatomy in my course. You got my point, no need to be rude.
