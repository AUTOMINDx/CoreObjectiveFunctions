My birthday is tomorrow and I think I might end up spending it aloneâ€” what are some things I can do to make it less lonely?
I turn 25 tomorrow and I live far from my family, I spent Christmas alone today &amp; I was supposed to have plans tomorrow but my friend fell sick. What can I do to make it more fun even if I have to spend it alone?
