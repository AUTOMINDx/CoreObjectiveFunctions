Autopsy says that sister died of an aorto-enteric fistula. She had been unwell for a year. It was apparently missed on multiple CT scans
I am 25F, 140lbs, 5'5. My sister (32) just died after having complained of ripping pain in her back and GI symptoms for a year and I want answers. I am typing out her medical history as best I know it because before she died we sat down together and typed it out for a new doctor. 

**Beginning, Dec. 2020**: A year ago my sister complained of sharp stabbing pain between her back that progressed to burning pain across her shoulder blades that came on suddenly when she ate. Also pain in her epigastric area. She texted me on December 11, 2020 saying that there was something causing pressure between her shoulder blades that was preventing her from taking a deep breath. She also said she could not pass gas and was nauseous. I told her to go to the ER. 

She went to the ER and they did some blood tests, a chest x-ray and checked her gallbladder and found nothing, gave her a GI cocktail and a lidocaine patch and sent her home. The pain got worse and she also developed panic attacks and couldn't sleep. She developed a huge fear of eating and lost 20lbs very rapidly. She kept clutching the area between her left shoulder blade and her spine and could not wear a bra anymore due to the pain. She had to take a leave of absence from her job and move back in with our parents. She started sobbing every day and expressing suicidal thoughts from the pain and panic so my parents checked her into a psych ward. 

**January 2020, Hospitalization:** The psych ward was at a major teaching hospital so they ran a bunch of blood tests on her in addition to pumping her full of meds. She had had some negative experiences with doctors in the past so at this point she was obsessively researching what could be wrong with her online, reading papers and constantly texting me possible diagnoses. Hiatal hernia, MALS, nephroptosis were all on her list. She texted me saying her heart felt like a hammer in her back and her stomach felt like it was in her chest, and she would hear her heart pounding in her ear constantly. She also told me she saw her aorta bouncing up and down in her stomach but the doctors told her it was just because she was thin.

She declined getting a CTA that they offered her at the hospital because she had had several CT scans in the past due to a car accident and was very afraid of excess radiation.  The hospital did not take her pain seriously and said it was totally fine if she didn't get it. They attributed all her symptoms and panic to psychological problems which in retrospect it clearly wasn't. 

At the hospital they did a tilt table test and she passed out so they diagnosed her with POTS (even though her BP was high) and put her on a bunch of POTS meds like mestinon and propranolol. They did not help really help her but she complied. They also put her on 60mg cymbalta which she said helped the pain a bit. 

They did an endoscopy and colonoscopy and found a bunch of linear erosions in her stomach but did not know why they were there so they didn't investigate further. No H. Pylori. The pathology report said they could come from taking NSAIDs but she did not take NSAIDs. 

**Late February 2020:** Two weeks after she got out of the hospital, she had chest pains and said she was so bloated in her back that she couldn't pass gas. We told her to go back to the ER. The finally saw her d-dimer was elevated and did a chest x-ray and CTA. They were expecting to find pulmonary embolism but they found a "mass-like density" in the lingula of her lung as well as pleural effusion and atelectasis. I am looking at the report now and it said no evidence of dissection or aneurysm, but also image degradation due to motion. The ER doc diagnosed her with pneumonia, but said it was strange because her lungs sounded totally fine and she didn't have a fever or anything. She sent her home with antibiotics. Radiologist report recommended follow up CT without contrast to "document resolution and exclude neoplastic disease."

**March 2020:** She took the antibiotics but that did not make the pain go away. She went and saw a MALS doctor and got a doppler ultrasound to check for MALS. Her inspiration velocities of celiac artery were 27, and expiration were 215 so he diagnosed her with MALS even though he said velocities were low. He recommended a CTA of abdomen to continue but my sister again did not want more radiation. 

**On the radiation piece:** I feel like all of her docs and especially her PCP mismanaged this so much. In retrospect all of her OCD-like symptoms, panic attacks and fear of radiation were clearly due to the pressure on her aorta and occult internal bleeding, but everyone just thought she was nuts.   


**April - August 2020:** At this point my sister started gaining weight. Like 60lbs in the span of 2.5 months. It didn't make a ton of sense because she wasn't eating much but her PCP attributed it to the mirtazipine they had her on in the psych ward to sleep. She went from weighing 150lbs to 215lbs and she became a recluse. She was still in pain every day but she returned to working from home and it almost seemed like maybe she could live with the pain if it was going to be chronic. I am loooking back at our texts, and in mid-August she told me the pain had changed from burning pain to a "ripped off fascia" feeling and she could feel like a thin membrane moving around in her back to the left of her spine. She said it was extremely unnerving and felt like her entire ribcage was falling in the back and she couldn't breathe. When she told her doctor this she didn't know what to except recommend the follow-up chest CT because maybe it was lung cancer.   


**September 2020:** She had a follow up chest CT and the report said the "mass-like density had gotten smaller, "probably infectious or inflammatory." She went to the pulmonologist for a breathing test and tot review her imaging and they said she had powerful lungs like a swimmer.   


**October 2020:** This part is hard for me to write about. She was visibly declining mentally in October and had repeated panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. She kept texting me about them and I would talk to her and try to calm her down and beg her to keep herself safe, that we were going to find an answer. She said she could not breathe and that she had the sensation of strips of cloth moving around and twisting around her spine o the left. She said her stomach felt inside out. She also said she felt like there was a "stretchy noodle" in her back to the left of her spine.   


**November 2020:** Her PCP convinced her to get an abdominal CTA even though she said she didn't think it was going to find anything. She got the CTA and it found nothing except a collapsed stomach and a small ovarian cyst on the right ovary. At this point she texted us saying she was constantly feeling like she was on the verge of passing out anytime she tried to walk anymore and was nauseous and retching, but not vomiting. My family didn't know what to tell her as the ER had not really done anything for her in the past and she had just had a CT scan.   


Over the weekend after Thanksgiving my sister wasn't answering her phone or texts. My parents and I got worried and so I went over to her apartment on Monday, November 22 and convinced the property manager to let me in. I found her laying unconscious on her bed and immediately called 911. The ambulance arrived and pronounced her dead. My family is completely heartbroken and we don't know what to do.   


They did an autopsy and looked inside her abdomen. They found a small fistula between her duodenum and aorta which is I guess what killed her. They still don't know why but they said it could have been a genetic defect. I am so depressed. I can't believe it was missed on multiple scans and no one helped her. I just wonder if her death could have been prevented if it had been discovered sooner.
