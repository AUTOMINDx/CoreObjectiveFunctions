My younger brother feels it necessary for him to bring his gun everywhere. That makes me a bit uncomfortable, is it reasonable and justified to ask him to leave it in his car while we have Christmas?
The fact that he found necessary to bring to have a gun at his side over Thanksgiving bothered me as well.
