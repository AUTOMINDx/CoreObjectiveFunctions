stop fucking telling me to "push myself"
i literally dont know how much longer i can cope with this i just need to get it out somewhere people will actually understand what i'm talking about.

pushing myself to do more things than i can manage is not a triumph. it is irresponsible to my health. i let myself down every time i do it and i am Sick of being praised for it.

by telling me to ignore my body begging for rest you are not being the saviour you think you are. you are HURTING me. (@ ableds)

do you guys deal with this daily? is there any explanation that will work for people who say this?
