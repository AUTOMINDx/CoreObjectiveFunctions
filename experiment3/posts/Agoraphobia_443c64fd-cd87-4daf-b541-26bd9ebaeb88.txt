A new bout of agoraphobia after 15 years
I had a severe stint of agoraphobia with a few hospitalizations about 15 years ago. 
I got better. For many years.
I recently did a lot of traveling for work and when I returned, those feelings of fear came back.
I'm scared to be in the car, scared for my family while they are gone.
I'm not bedridden as I was before but the fear is so overwhelming that some days I just cry off an on all day.
I see a psych this week and am struggling with how to describe my symptoms.
Did anyone else have a relapse after years of no symptoms?
