I am tired of EVERYONE claiming trauma and PTSD. It cheapens the real thing.
Listen, I know trauma comes in many different forms and I know that even traumas that seem ‘mild’ to me can result in PTSD, but people seem to be claiming PTSD without a professional diagnosis a LOT. 

I don’t take pride in my trauma or PTSD, but I hate that, because tons of people are jumping on the bandwagon, it makes it seem that my actual PTSD which I earned the old fashioned way (by experiencing a traumatic event that was listed in the DSM-V) is just ‘a trend’ and not real, substantial and horrific. 

War. Rape. Catastrophic accident. Child abuse. These are things that are so horrible that your brain gets stuck in a permanent state of ‘danger!’ level arousal. These are things are so wildly outside of the mind’s ability to cope with that the mind just shuts off those areas completely. I am not alone when I say that without intensive therapy I couldn’t even remember most of the details of my rape (I do now). 

Come on, people!

Update: 
1) People have some really good points about gatekeeping. I appreciate that and didn’t realize that I was doing that. Learning for me. 
2) Seems like a whole lot of people didn’t even read my post. If you have real, legit PTSD then own it. But if you watched a crappy episode of Seinfeld and are moaning about how that ‘triggered’ you and you have PTSD from that time you got too drunk and embarrassed yourself at Thanksgiving dinner- I don’t want to hear about it.  Gatekeeping be damned- don’t water down a horrific disorder by claiming that losing your hamster caused PTSD for you.
