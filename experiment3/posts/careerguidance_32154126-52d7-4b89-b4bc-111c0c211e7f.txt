I just got fired yesterday and I need a new job soon. Do people hire at this time?
I worked my first gig as a recruiter coordinator and I helped hire well over 80 sales reps for my first client in a 5 month period and by help I mean I did literally almost all the work. Unfortunately my boss fired me. His reason for doing so didn’t make sense so I can’t really talk about it. He just zoomed me in and said “it’s not working” and fired me, removed me from slack and even unconnected with me on Linkedin. Again I didn’t do anything that I know of that was bad apart from minor mistakes here and there but I always fixed them as they arise, with me the company was making more money than before even (this is a small company like 5 people including me).

But that’s not important as I don’t want yo work with such people anyways. I want to find a new job in the field. To continue becoming a recruiter or something along those lines. I heard that people don’t hire at this time of the year. Is that true? I am low on money because of an incident and i really want to find a new job ASAP so I’m quite worried if companies aren’t hiring at this time like I heard. Also as a bonus does anyone have any advice on what to do to cheer up? That would be a bonus because I’m quite depressed atm
