My physics teacher couldn't answer thus question, can u guys pls help me ?
My thought was, that if I move a heavy object on the horizontal, I need to put in energy to make the object move. But the energy of the object and its position is the same. So where did the energy I put in to move the object go if it didn't add to the one saved in the object? And it most went somewhere since energy can't get lost and only transfer between different forms

Edit: please excuse my grammar 

Edit: since a lot of people talk about friction, I forgot to say that in my original idea I lifted the Object up, but put it back on the same height. Example is a pencil u pick up on a desk and Put it down somewhere else on the same desk
