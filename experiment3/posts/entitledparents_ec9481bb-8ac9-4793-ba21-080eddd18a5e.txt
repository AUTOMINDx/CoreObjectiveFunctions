My (23F) mother (50F) is hounding me to give her a baby, when I’m single and not even interested in children…
All I hear from my mom is how much she wants a grand baby, when I’ll be giving her one. It’s getting annoying and I’ve told her countless times I’m not ready to have any children as of now. We’ve even had an argument about it. Maybe this is common for mothers to say whenever their daughter reach a certain age? But it’s just getting too much. 

I’ve suggested why she doesn’t pressure my younger sister to give her kids (we’re not that much different in age) my mom said “she’s got potential to achieve more things in her life.” I’m shocked… like *am I not capable or worthy of accomplishing more?!* I’m aware my sister is favored and the golden child, but will I finally be recognized if I give my mom a grand baby? 

I have my associates, just got my bachelors… currently working on my masters and have a solid career. My parents are aware of all of this, yet I’m pressured to have a child soon. Not happening btw!
