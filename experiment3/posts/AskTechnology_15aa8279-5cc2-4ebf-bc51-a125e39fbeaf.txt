Does anyone has any universal remote suggestions?
We have a Sony TV and a Rifo sound bar. Well our doggie chewed up the sound bar remote. I was looking on Amazon for a universal remove but it seems like they all have specific brands listed and our off-brand sound bar isnâ€™t one of them. Will a generic universal remote still work?
