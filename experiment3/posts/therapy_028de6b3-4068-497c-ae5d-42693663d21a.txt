Is it normal for a therapist to be distracted during most sessions?
She’d text/look at her phone while I’m talking or use her computer. She’d also pack her things (if I chose to see her in the last session of her shift).  Sometimes I have to repeat what I said while she looks at her phone. She’s a really good therapist but I really don’t like it when she uses her phone and I feel like I’m being ignored and I end up leaving the session angry and regret spending money. I don’t know how to bring it up I don’t have the guts to. Is this normal? Could it be because what I’m talking about is stressful and she’s using her phone to cope? Any help appreciated.
