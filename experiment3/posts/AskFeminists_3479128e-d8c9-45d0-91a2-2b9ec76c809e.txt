Thoughts on cosmetic surgery
Hello everyone, I’m a trans woman. I’m highly critical of the cosmetic sector and I feel very conflicted about my need to get a facial feminization surgery, most importantly a forehead reconstruction and a tracheal shave. Most trans people would say facial feminization surgery is different from standard cosmetic surgeries as it alleviates gender dysphoria and there’s some truth to that but I still feel like doing this will stand against my beliefs. I definitely don’t want to pay thousands of dollars that I could spend on good causes into a patriarchal sector designed to take advantage of traumatised women by beauty standards but also I don’t think I can handle not being able to look at the mirror every morning. Is there a way to reconcile these feelings?
