Where do I begin?
As the title suggests, where do I begin to learn about Cosmology? I’m thinking of taking it up at a University level maybe even a PhD because I’m so so so interested in it, but I also feel like I know nothing. So how do I give myself a solid foundation in cosmology? Where do I begin - what do I read/watch? Thanks :)
