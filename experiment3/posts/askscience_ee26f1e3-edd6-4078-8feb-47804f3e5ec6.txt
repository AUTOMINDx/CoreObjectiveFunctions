How broadly might Pfizerâ€™s new covid antiviral pill work?
I read that Pfizer's new pill, paxlovid, is a protease inhibitor that interferes with viral replication, and that they expect it to work just as well against omicron as it did against previous variants. 

Will it work against all potential sars-cov-19 variants? Might it work on other coronavirus? Other types of viruses, like influenza?
