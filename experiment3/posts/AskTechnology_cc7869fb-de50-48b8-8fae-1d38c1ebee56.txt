Can I spoof a UK dial tone when abroad?
(For context, phone calls placed through UK phone networks have an immediately noticeably different dialtone to European networks).

My work has a (supposedly based on VAT tax rules) policy on us not being allowed to work while abroad, which I am keen to completely disregard.

We are all homeworkers, and have a lightly surveilled ICT system (I have pretty ironclad assurances on this through our work as a union branch). So, I am pretty certain that a personal VPN would let all my computer-based work go unnoticed.

However, we have work-issued mobiles, and any calls placed to my workphone while on the continent woulld give me away due to European dialtone.

Which is all to ask:  Is there any way to spoof the UK tone?

 (I am less concerned about outgoing calls, simple as I never make them and always use VOIP)
