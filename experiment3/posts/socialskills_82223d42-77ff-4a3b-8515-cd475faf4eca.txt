Seeing girls as only gf material
So I've been in an all boys school for 18 years. I'm really cool around the guys and in most situations, would approach them pretty easily. But it's not the same case with girls. Whenever I try talking to a girl , I start seeing her as a girlfriend material and I would mess up everything.I start acting very shy and weird and that ruins most of it. Any advice
