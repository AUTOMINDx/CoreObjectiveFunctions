It's normal or appropiate for a 13 year-old boy to bathe with his 10yo little brother?
I am 19yo, usually I am not at home Wednesday, but yesterday I came to my home just to ask my 13yo brother a favor, and I heard my two brothers laughing on the bathroom, and I saw them with the door opened, they were on the tub together, my 10yo brother was naked just wearing a white brief, and my 13yo brother was also shirtless just wearing his blue short pants who use to play football. The tub is for just one person, so my 10yo brother was laying over my 13yo brother.

I was shocking, but anyway I entered to the bathroom and I started to talk with my 13yo brother, and he was talking with me and playing with my brother at the same time, acting like it was normal, then I just left.

This morning I talked with my mother about that, and she says that it's normal and even cute, but I find it weird and inappropiate. 

It is appropiate?
