Is information the foundation of reality?
I saw this article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.space.com/amp/29477-did-information-create-the-cosmos.html

And this reddit comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/ibmgkk/comment/g21u227/

That both made somewhat compelling points towards reality being made of information. I also saw this article: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/why-information-cant-be-the-basis-of-reality/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-5Ojoouz0AhVPgXIEHQRUCoIQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Naz0j6qJuDJ2u1uiD9a5X

That implies the opposite. Kinda confused on which points to believe, was hoping for some help here.

Edit: I also saw these two wiki articles: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bousso%27s_holographic_bound

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound

That both mention this idea that information is fundamental, or not a human made construct
