[Marvel] Who is more accurate, Bullseye or Hawkeye?
I’ve seen many people state that Bullseye has more ridiculous accuracy feats, but I haven’t really checked Hawkeye’s top tier feats out. Is Bullseye legitimately more accurate than Clint, or is Hawkeye just as accurate, but his morality and preference for a bow prevents him from pulling off the same feats as Bullseye?

I’m aware that Ultimate Hawkeye has looser morals than the 616 version. After all, the 616 version of Hawkeye vocalized his beliefs on the sanctity of human life in Solo Avengers issue 8 (I believe, haven’t read Solo Avengers in a while).

I’m referring to both the comics and the MCU versions. Any versions, really.
