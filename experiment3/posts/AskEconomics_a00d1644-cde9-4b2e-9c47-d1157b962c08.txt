Have wages stayed low because firms behave like monopsonies?
I know a monopsony is only 1 buyer and many sellers, but can’t fast food, call centers, and other similar low paying jobs be viewed as monopsonies? Prior to the great resignation, low skilled laborers had no choice but to accept the going wage for their position because they needed a job. The great resignation helped because people were able to save more and be comfortable with the extra money. This was not possible before. 

So if laborers were price takers, and firms set the wages, wouldn’t they be a monopsony?
