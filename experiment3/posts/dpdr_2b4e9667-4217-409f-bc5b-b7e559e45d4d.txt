Is it really gonna end for me?
Is the dissociation ever gonna end for me? I mean what if I have it til I die? I’ve already had it almost 3 years and if I have to live out the rest of my life like this then I’m not gonna continue. What I mean is if there were a day (even if it were in 10 years) that I was able to just go back to normal reality I would be happy but if not honestly I’m tired of the bs. Seeing all the people saying they’ve found peace with it. I respect that but I give up and if it’s not going away I am because I can’t keep doing this everyday
