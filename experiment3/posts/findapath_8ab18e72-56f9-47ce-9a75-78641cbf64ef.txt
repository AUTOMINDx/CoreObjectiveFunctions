26M, soon to be CS graduate, want to get into medicine/health instead
I've always had a passion for Medicine but never got into it because I made some stupid decisions when I was young(I graduated High School at 16 years old and ended up choosing CS because I was young and stupid). I have negative interest in CS. I literally could not give any less of a shit about this field than I already do. On the other hand, I can research and learn about the human body all day. I'm pretty good at biology and chemistry. I'm taking them as electives currently and I find myself doing way better and enjoying those classes way more than my CS classes. However, I am about to graduate with my CS bachelors by Spring so I was wondering what path I could take in order to reach my goals of studying medicine. I have even considered becoming a physicians assistant but I need some advice on how to get there

Thank you
