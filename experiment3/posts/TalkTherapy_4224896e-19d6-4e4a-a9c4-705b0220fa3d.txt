Is it appropriate to email my old therapist to say thanks?
I was terminated by my old therapist for appropriate reasons. We left on amicable terms.

I wanted to let him know that I really cherished our sessions together and that despite everything that happened I grew a lot and learned from those sessions. 

Is this overstepping client/therapist boundaries?
