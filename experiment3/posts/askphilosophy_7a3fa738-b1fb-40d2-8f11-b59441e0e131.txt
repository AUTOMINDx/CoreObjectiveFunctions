Is the dialectic method truly a science?
When I say dialectic I mean Marxist dialectic. In the socialist literature, I read Marx and Engels both refer to dialectic as a scientific method, Stalin's writings as well. 

It is repeated over and over it is a scientific method. 

When I think of dialectic I think of having a thesis, and attempting to prove, disprove or expand on it the thesis or creating an antithesis that evolves that original into something new. 

According to Marx contradictions cause this for example the contradictions of class society, working-class, and capitalist class with their opposing interests. 

Can this be regarded as science though?
