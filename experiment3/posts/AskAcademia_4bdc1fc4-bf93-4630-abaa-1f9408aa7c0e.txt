Mid-career professional considering jump to college professor world
I graduated 13 years ago with a BS in general science. I’ve spent the last 10 years as a technical writer / program manager at a FAANG company in Silicon Valley. I love love love the money and benefits, and it has all been a pretty good experience. However,  I’ve basically hit my limit climbing the corporate ladder unless I want to get an MBA and attempt to move into management (I don’t). I’m also experiencing some moderate burnout, partly due to the general lack of meaning at my job and also because I have 2 little kids and want to spend more time with them. 

Soooo, I’m looking for a new career with more flexibility for my family and in something that I have more passion about. The idea of pursuing a Master’s degree and then becoming an adjunct professor seems appealing. My questions are:

1) How difficult is it to make this transition, having no academic or teaching experience at all but with lots of private sector experience?
2) What steps should I take now to gracefully exit my current career and start tip toeing down this path?
3) How easy is it to control your schedule as an adjunct professor?
4) What advice would you give someone considering making this transition?

EDIT: I appreciate all the responses so far! I should clarify that the money is the only thing I currently like about my current career and my family has made me realize that some things are more important than money. My spouse makes enough money to support our household now so money is not the point of this transition. I’m just looking for advice on how to transition to a more meaningful part time career. I don’t care about salary or benefits or even job security, which I why I thought adjunct at a community college could be a good path.
