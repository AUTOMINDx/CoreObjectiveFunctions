Chinese has many dialects, and there are dialects that are so different that other Chinese speakers cannot understand them, but they are still dialects and not other languages. So what is the criteria to become another language?
Bonus fact: Spanish and Portuguese people can still understand each other even though they speak 2 different languages but they are 2 languages, not 2 dialects. Same with Lao and Thai people.
