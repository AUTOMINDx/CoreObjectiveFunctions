Are guys put off when a girl asks them out first?
So I'm (19 F) thinking of asking a guy (19 M) out, maybe to the movies or a Christmas event. My only concern is if guys find it off-putting if a girl does it first, and if it will seem desperate/weird. I've already brought it up during text a couple of weeks ago and he said "yeah sure hahaha" (like word for word), but we didn't talk about any concrete plans or set time, so now I'm thinking of asking in person. What do y'all think? Should I go for it? Any tips?

Update: thanks for all the encouragement and advice! I did it and he literally said he’ll go no matter what lol. But since I’m kinda worried that it’ll be a bit awkward if it’s just the two of us, i suggested we both brought a couple of friends and he agreed :))

Even if this time it isn’t exactly “going out” with someone, this definitely gave me courage to ask guys out in the future, so thanks to everyone who replied &lt;3
