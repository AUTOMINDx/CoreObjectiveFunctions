Long Covid Created the Optimal Diet
I have lost my sense of taste and smell since I contracted Sars II in August of this year. I can not taste a thing, no amount of aroma therapy has worked. It was very depressing at first, but I have since reframed the situation. Sugar, salt, and butter do not do anything for me anymore. Since I can no longer taste or smell food I have decided to eat the same thing everyday with three goals in mind: optimal health, optimal muscle building, and saving as money as possible. I feel like an Android, so this may not be for you, but after 100s of hours of research I have concocted a mad scientist diet that I believe to be bulletproof. And man let me tell you it was hard. Food Industries have tainted the science with their funded studies. That's why there is so much contradictory information out there. And not to mention the woo woo, pseudo scientific bullshit you have to sift through. A lot of people are going to downvote and criticized this diet due to either of these camps and I do not care. It's bulletproof and I can back it up. Prepare to lose the debate in the comment section. 

Along with the diet I have incorporated 4 day a week weight training program, an intermittent fasting routine with a 4-5 hour feeding window followed by a 17-18 hour fast, quit smoking pot and cigarettes, quit drinking alcohol, adopted good sleep hygiene (7.5 hours a night) and have been doing the Wim Hof method (10 min breathing exercise followed by 3 min cold shower, followed by a 20 min meditation session. From my andecdotal experience, I don't feel like a million dollars, I feel like a billion dollars. My mood has done a 180 (bipolar symptoms have subsided), my skin has completely cleared up, my seasonal allergies are a thing of the past, my cognition is sharper, my energy levels are better than my 20s (I'm 35), and for what it's worth, my erections are harder than a diamond in a hail storm. I have put on 10 pounds in 10 weeks since starting and have been progressing nicely in the gym. I wanted to share it with others to take it or leave it because of how great it's been for me. Here it is, the optimal diet for human health and muscle building.

- 3/4 Cup Coconut Milk Yogurt (unsweetened)

- 1 tsp Maca (gelentazied)

This diet is roughly 3,200 calories with 136g of protein. Zero grams added sugar and trans fat. Every micronutrient is overbuilt, every ingredient has a purpose. For instance the cranberry juice gets you iodine while the Brazil nut get you your selenium needs. The sodium to potassium ratio is 1 to 5 (just like hunter gathers), and the vast majority of the fat is healthy monosaturated (also aids in testosterone optimization). It's great for digestion with prebiotics (111g fiber) and pro biotics (coconut milk yogurt), plus I don't have to wipe anymore for #2. You may have to adjust proportions to meet your unique needs, MyFitnessPal is a great resource. For a late night appetite suppressant I would recommend mineral water.

Notes:

Keep vegetables, vegetable/fruit juice, coconut milk yogurt, hemp powder, chia seeds, and Brazil nut amount the same when scaling down to keep micronutrient profile

Double the cranberry juice to 4oz if pregnant

Switch wheat germ out for ground flaxseed if female

Make sure cinnamon is of Ceylon variety as cassia variety could be toxic to liver
