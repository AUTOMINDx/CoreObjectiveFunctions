How to tell my cousin I’m pregnant. She’s attempted to have children for 10 years now…
Women on my mom’s side of the family have always had trouble with fertility and having children. Between my mom, aunt, and grandmother.. they lost more than 5 babies. 

My cousin is now in her mid 30’s and I’m 28 years old. She’s endured multiple fertility treatments (including 2 rounds of IVF). It’s always been a sensitive subject because her husband is one of 13 siblings. 

I’ve told everyone in my family, but her. I love her so much and I want to be sensitive to her. This is my first pregnancy and honestly was not expecting it… I’m filled with guilt when all I want to do is celebrate. 

Posting here to see if there are any women whom have struggled with this issue and how they would handle a situation like this.
