Dog destroyed gift from husbands ex, should I tell him about the note inside?
I (29F) have been with my husband (30M) for 2 years married for 1.
He's out of town for a few days so I took over letting the dog out in the morning. I snoozed a couple times and let the dog out less than 30 minutes after the normal schedule.
Our dog had chewed threw the corner of a handmade throw pillow during this time (more of a tear, its unlikely pup ingested much if any but I am watching in case). It was a gift from husbands ex. 
I never had a problem with this pillow as it was well made, matched our decor, and didn't get the sense my husband had any emotional attachment to it so we kept it.
Upon finding the pillow I took it apart to see if I could repair it and found a note in with the stuffing written by ex. 
The gist is "I'm sorry I can't tell you how much I love you so I made this instead. I love you now and always" and now I'm conflicted.
I could repair the pillow although I'd probably need to tell him I did since it would be noticeable if looked at closely.

I'm conflicted because he had told me he loved his ex but felt she didn't really care for him as much as he did for her and it led to their breakup (rarely told him she loved him and only when he said it first). It now seems like she was scared to be open and made the pillow as a way to communicate how she felt. 
Should I tell him about the note or just pretend it didn't exist? I don't think it's enough to ruin our relationship but I don't want him to him to reconsider his decision to break up with her in the first place 

tldr husband's ex confessed her love in a note i found by accident, should i tell him?

edit: he saw her over xmas while we visited his hometown....
