What do you think of the country music genre getting away with misogyny?
I hear people talk about how rap is very much misogynistic, and while I can say that a lot of rap music is misogynistic, why don't I hear any criticism when country music gets away with misogyny?

I see a lot of country songs written by men are mostly about girls and while writing a song for a girl you like isn't inherently misogynistic, most of the lyrics in country songs about girls seem to objectify women.

When I see country songs written by women, they seem more feminist and less sexist.
