Tesla or UBS internship? Which is best?
Hi all,

I have currently been offered an internship at Tesla within Finance and Accounting and at UBS (swiss bank) within Asset Management. However, I am unsure which one to pick. Any advice on what would look best on a CV and help me land some nice positions in the future?

Thank you!
