does anyone understand this?
i can see but i cant ? it’s like my eyes are closed 24/7 but i can still see, just very brokenly. depth perspective is gone, everything has no depth to it and looking down stairs is crazy trippy. always feel like i need to remind myself this is real life. it’s awful. anyone else understand this?
