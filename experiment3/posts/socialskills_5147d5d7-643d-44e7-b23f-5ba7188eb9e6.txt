How to avoid crushes at school and work?
TLDR, lifes too short to have to deal with the anxiety and anger that comes with crushes.

So im 22 yo male, in my last year of college, and as such i will be going to employment soon (hopefully). My problem is crushes, i can get too easily  infatuated with females and it can just make a job so much more awkward than it should be, and especially going into a place i may be working for years i don't want to be branded as creepy or whatever. There just no real positive to crushes and it would be great to eliminate them. I have no interest in dating at all really, im not attractive nor do i have a good personality for dating, rather just focus on my work. I feel like this fear of developing crushes also limits me in making platonic female friends, as i dont want to catch feels at all. Anybody have any tips on consistently and confidently  avoiding crushes? I feel like dealing with it on a case by case basis could just get so tiresome and annoying. Thanks
