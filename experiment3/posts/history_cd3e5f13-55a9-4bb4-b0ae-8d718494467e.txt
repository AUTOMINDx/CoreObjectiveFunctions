Areus's letter to the Jews - What in the world?
Hey! It's Cleba76. I never post here, but I was skimming Wikipedia earlier today and came across something I just legitimately can't explain at all. Areus's letter to the jews. In the 200s\~ BC, this spartan king seems to have stumbled across some kind of document that apparently told him that, and quote, "Jews and the Lacedemonians are of one stock, and are derived from the kindred of Abraham."

I've never heard of this claim of kinship between the jews and spartans, but apparently it existed because the letter seems to be fairly well documented in a couple different sources. What gives? Is there anything supporting it?

Thanks!
