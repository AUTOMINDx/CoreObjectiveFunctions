My therapist says there’s nothing he can do to help me; maybe I should just give up.
It’s pretty much all in the title. At my last therapy session, my counselor told me “I don’t think I can help you. Maybe you just have to get worse before you can get better.”

I don’t think I can get worse. This seems like an inappropriate thing for a counselor to say, but I still can’t help but wonder if he’s right. Maybe I’m unfixable.

Has anyone ever dealt with a counselor stopping to this level? Am I irrational for thinking that there’s something he should be able to do to help? I don’t want to pay for therapy if I’ll never improve.

I dunno, just rambling a bit here.
