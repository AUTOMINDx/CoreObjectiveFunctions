How do I accept that my husband wants to leave me? Is there life after divorce? Can I fix it? Please help me ):
Second update: I have been crying for about fourteen hours and am completely drained. I called my mum and she and my aunt immediately helped me to make a room at my grandparents home (she is renovating and has nowhere for me right now). I am absolutely heartbroken at having to leave two of my cats behind and to be losing so much of my heart and life. I couldn’t appreciate the comments you guys have given me anymore and I promise once I can, I will respond to everyone. My mum will be back here in the morning to help me pack everything away and I’m enjoying the last few hours of getting to see my babies (cats). I have an appointment with my regular psychologist on Friday, so I’m hoping that she can give me some tools to help me recover from this breakdown in my life. I am completely astounded and overwhelmed by the amount of support I received and I just wish that I could be totally okay and not care, like he does.


Update: my husband left me.


My husband (30M) and I (28f) have been together for almost ten years and married for four of those. I just woke up to a text message saying “We should talk when I get home”, and I know things haven’t been perfect and I know he is going to tell me that it’s over. I love him so much and can’t imagine my life without him and now I feel like everything has just stopped. I’m sitting on the edge of the bed trying really hard not to throw up (really bad anxiety), and I just don’t know what to do. Is there life after divorce so young? I don’t remember what it’s like to be alone and I’m so scared.
