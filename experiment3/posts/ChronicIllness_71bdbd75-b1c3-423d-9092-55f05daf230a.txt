Guilt and shame over not being able to bathe/shower regularly
I’m been having a rough go especially lately and I feel so guilty for not being able to get a shower or bath. I’ve been just depending on dry shampoo and baby wipes. 

I know I shouldn’t feel this way because it’s not my fault I’m not well. It’s just difficult ugh.

EDIT: I can’t thank you all enough for the support and suggestions and big hugs to those who are feeling the same ❤️
