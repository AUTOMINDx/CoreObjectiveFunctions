How much of a raise should I ask for?
A coworker of mine left and I took over almost all of her tasks (I would say about roughly 90%). I became the lead on quite a few projects and am the only one who knows how to use a specific software in the group. I hesitated asking for a raise because I felt like I wasn't originally qualified to take on these responsibilities and it was a hard transition. However it has been a few months now and I've been able to maintain our deadlines and have made a lot of progress. 

I think I should be asking for a raise now but I'm unsure of how much to ask for. Is 10% of my salary a fair ask or should I go higher if I want 10%? I know they were paying my coworker a lot more but she also had a higher level of education than I do and different certifications. Thank you in advance!
