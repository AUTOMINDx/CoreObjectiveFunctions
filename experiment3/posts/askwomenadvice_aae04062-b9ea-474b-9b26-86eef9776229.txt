To all of my women out there with strict/ethnic parents—how did you navigate telling them that you are moving in with your significant other?
I’m 26 years old (F), currently living in an apartment with a friend of mine. After our lease is up, I plan on finding a place with my boyfriend (29 M) of 2.5 years. I have no idea how to tell my strict-ish Arab parents, who expect us to live separately until marriage. I don’t want to hinder my relationship with them, nor do I want them to resent my boyfriend (who they currently really like!)

Yeah, it’s crazy that I am still worried about this as an adult, but I know y’all understand what I mean. Any advice?
