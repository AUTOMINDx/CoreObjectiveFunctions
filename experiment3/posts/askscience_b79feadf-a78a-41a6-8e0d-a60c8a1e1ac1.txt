Why does COVID-19 seem to have so many more variants than other pandemic-inducing pathogens?
To clarify, the title is merely my perception of the situation, not an assertion of fact!

  
Basically it feels like compared to other pandemics in history, such as Spanish flu, the pandemic resulting from this particular coronavirus has included many more variants and possibly is more long lasting.

My guess is that compared to former pandemics, we are simply a lot better at identifying new variants, so prior similar episodes were lumped into one single pathogen? As for the longevity, it may be because we're actually a lot better at preventing death and spread than in previous pandemics, there are more uninfected people for a longer period of time leaving them open to infection for longer?

These are just some of my guesses, but i'm curious if my perception is just simply incorrect or if not, what the actual reasons are behind these phenomena.
