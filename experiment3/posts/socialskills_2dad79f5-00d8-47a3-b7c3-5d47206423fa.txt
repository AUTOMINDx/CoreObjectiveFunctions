How do some unbelievably shy and anxious people manage to get so wild at parties?
I’ve met People who I know for a fact are far more quiet and anxious than myself in day to day life, with diagnosed anxiety disorder and all, who at parties are dancing like no one is watching and it’s the last day on earth, being social butterflies as though they’re releasing all their repressed energy. 

And it’s not just the liquid courage either, some of them don’t even drink.

I asked one of these types recently what’s got them feeling so good at a house party and they couldn’t explain it, from the outside it looks like their self consciousness has just melted away. 

I’m envious. 

Although I’m not that anxious day to day, I never reach that stage of not giving a single fuck no matter what the occasion is or how much alcohol I’ve ingested.

What’s the secret?
