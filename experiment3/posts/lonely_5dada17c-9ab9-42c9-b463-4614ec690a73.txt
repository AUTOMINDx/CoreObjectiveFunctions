Delete all my social media. What you guys think?
(19M)I'm bout to delete my Facebook, Instagram, and other social media accounts. For the last few days, I feel like social media make me more anxious and feel extra lonely. All I saw on my feeds is how awesome others' lives seemed to be. I know that some of it is fake, and people only post what they want other to see. However I still have FOMO and feel inferior for myself.

Can anyone share your thoughts and experiences with me? Or simply reply 'hi~'
I'd like to know.  :D
