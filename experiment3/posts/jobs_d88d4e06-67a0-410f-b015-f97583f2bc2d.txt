My coworkers got 50-200% more stock options than I did even though we started at the same time
Two of my coworkers at separate times (and unprompted by me) have mentioned how many stock options they received when we were all hired at the same time several years ago. Their numbers being so much greater than mine makes me realize how little my contribution is valued in relation to others on the team. I understand that different roles are valued differently but it still stings. Managers often tell me how valued I am because I am a hardworking, conscientious team player etc but those are just words. The promotions, stock options, and raises they give to some members of our team but not others tell the real story. I don’t know why I am having trouble processing this information since it is pretty black and white. I am attached to “the team” and genuinely like many of the people I work with, but to the company I am just a cog, to be used as cost efficiently as possible, and that shouldn’t surprise me.
