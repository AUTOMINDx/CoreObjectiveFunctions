Any tips on how to not be mentally overwhelmed when you haven’t gotten a job in your field several months after graduation?
I graduated back a few months ago and I’ve applied to I think almost 350+ jobs and it’s starting to affect me slowly. I’ve had interviews but the usual response is you don’t live in the area or Im just not good enough. Dealing with this and stressing about paying loans soon is affecting me more than it should. Im not sure if posting this type of question is okay but any advice would help a lot. Thank you  very much.

response: I would like to thank everyone. Thank you for your tips and advice. I am currently restarting my resume as some of you recommended and i am going to increase the amount of applications I submit per day. I’ll try to network more and see if I can get lucky there. I applied mainly in the state I live in and I am currently studying to try to take the fe exam. I am also trying to get my certification in solid works as well since I really enjoy using the program. 
Once again thank you very much. This has helped me a lot and cleared my doubts about a lot of things.
