Why do so many poor people vote Republican?
I cannot fathom why someone making under 30K a year would be against taxing billionaires to receive more welfare that would help them climb the ladder and instead vote for the people that are trying to cut their welfare and leave them in financial ruin. I mean I can't fathom why ANYONE other than billionaires would be against taxing billionaires to help the poor, but it makes even less sense for the poor who are the ones being most affected by this.

The only explanation I've seen to this thus far is that they think they'll be a billionaire one day. But are people really that delusional? Especially considering that a lot of the conservative demographic skews old.
