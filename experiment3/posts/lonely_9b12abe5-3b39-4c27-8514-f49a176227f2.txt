Considere this please
Here are a lot of guys asking only for friendship and instantaneously they ask for a picture, even if you only are talking only for 1 day. I think that's okay but no every girl here can do that. Some of us feel insecure about how they look.
And in general if the guy thinks u r ugly they stop to talk to you and if they think you are pretty they start to flirt. NOT EVERYONE but it happens.
So its nice to be comprehensive about it. 
Its okay if you don't want to send a pic. Even if that person insist. Women will understand me I guess.
Be kind. Im pretty insecure and it get me anxious when someone who barely chat with me ask for a picture and im not the only one.
And is not necessary send one to be friends. Is not.
Have a nice day.
