I am getting over a cold so I think my stomach is weak, and I went out for dinner with my dad. Had a drink and halfway through my salad I felt like I had no appetite. Fast forward two hours I threw up mostly bile (I hadn't eaten much all day). I have had this type of nausea before, I think it is related to my crappy stomach lining. Only this time I noticed quite a bit of blood with every heave (teaspoon per heave), but figured I must have torn my throat from coughing so much the last week. It wasn't small streaks, either. I tried to make myself cough hard to see if I could produce blood, and nothing. Only when I threw up.

I finished up, flushed, and drank water. I felt some pretty rough burning sensations, so I did some googling. After reading I quickly went to the closest ER. Told them I vomited blood and they asked how much and what color. I said a few teaspoons and it was fresh red. I waited for about two hours and the burning kind of went away. I told the nurse I was just going to leave and she more or less told me it was fine and that I was fine.

I am back home now, burning sensation has returned, and my googling has resumed. I am now reading it could be an ulcer or something. If it was as serious as the internet says, why did I wait for so long and why did they just let me leave? Can bleeding from gastritis/ulcer just get better on its own?
