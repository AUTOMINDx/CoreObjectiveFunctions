[Dune] Is the Empire of "The Known Universe", contain the whole Universe or just our galaxy?
I've wondered about this since rereading The Dune novels and watching the film adaptations again.

&amp;#x200B;

I was introduced to Dune through seeing the 1984 film on TV one time several years ago. At the time I always assumed the human empire encompassed the entire Universe. For example the Duke and Baron would rule their own private galaxy.

&amp;#x200B;

Since rereading the novels, I imagine it more as just our galaxy, which seems to make more sense. The "known universe" being what was been discovered and colonized since the time mankind left planet Earth.

What is the official cannon explanation?
