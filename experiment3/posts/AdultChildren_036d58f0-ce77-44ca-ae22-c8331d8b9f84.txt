I get triggered by weddings and engagements
Well, I will first say that my dad has shown up to every single event in my life drunk. It was embarrassing. My mom is an enabler (still married). My dad showed up to my wedding drunk and embarrassed me too. 

It makes me so angry and upset. I was talking to my therapist and she told me to reframe it and look at it as he was still trying to be supportive even if it was in his own dysfunctional way - most people would be mad that their parents didn’t show at all. For some reason, I can’t agree with that. 

But regardless, I get really emotional every time I see an engagement, or wedding. I cry. I can’t help but feel like I’m not as important as everyone else and I missed out on that “happy” moment.
