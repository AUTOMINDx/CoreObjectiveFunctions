Is it bad that I downvote anti-vaxxers?
No matter what they say, the moment they start a comment with “I’m an anti-vaxxer”, I hit the downvote button. Sometimes it’s not explicitly stated, all they say is “I didn’t get vaccinated and I’m fine”.

I generally consider myself open-minded and willing to listen to all opinions and not judge based on my first impression. But when it comes to vaccination… I feel like it’s a social responsibility? It doesn’t just affect you, it affects everyone else too. And I guess it gets on my nerves more cos there’s so much misinformation surrounding the topic as it is.

To clarify, I don’t mean unvaccinated people, who may have underlying conditions etc. I mean the people who identify as hostile to vaccinations.
