I didn't hear the name "John Brown" until after college. Who are some other "forgotten heroes" that get left out of the typical history curriculum?
It seems like a sin that 16 years of schooling didn't expose me to a bad ass like John Brown.  For those who aren't familiar with his story, John Brown was an abolitionist that attacked the armory in Harper's Ferry VA with the intention of starting a revolution to free America's enslaved people.  His story highlights the racial tensions that led to the civil war and was widely known at the time.  He was hung for treason 2 years before the start of the American Civil War.

Who else has the average person never heard of?


On a related note, I'd love some book recommendations where I can learn about Mr. Brown.
