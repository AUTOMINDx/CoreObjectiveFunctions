I have such a small range of emotions that it drives me crazy
The only reactions I get are in my chest, right below my collarbone. Feel bad? It twists or it's like a heavy weight. Feel good? It feels like someone is slamming something from the inside and it goes up to your throat. 

It's so stupid. I hate this whole thing so much. I miss being able to feel things as they are. I miss not being home for one moment and then the next checking out items at the store. I miss having a decent vocabulary, I miss being able to describe my feelings, I miss understanding how others feel too. 

It feels like everything's been robbed of me. There's nothing there. The most that can be taken are those two states, good or bad. Because the only other that exists is nothing. And you can't steal something that isn't there.

When something reaches me, it's like I'm back for a second. I remember things that before were at the tip of my tongue, my past isn't so elusive. My head doesn't feel full of cotton. But that's only that. My body still never feels mine. I'm on autopilot every day.
