Do abusers walk into a relationships thinking "Yep, I'm going to pretend to a nice person, then slowly isolate, emotionally manipulate, and abuse them" or how does it end up that way?
I'm confused about how much awareness is involved, or do they just act "naturally" and it happens to turn out this way?
