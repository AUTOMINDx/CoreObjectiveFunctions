Girl with SA wants do Engineering, is this a bad idea?
In most of my AP science classes I get talked over by others and ignored. I have awful anxiety and as a result I let myself get completely steam rolled and this especially happens with the guys in class. I want to do Engineering because I like money and I’m fairly competent at stem. But if I can’t handle highschool labs, I feel like I’ll be screwed for college. My parents don’t believe in therapy so I haven’t gotten any treatment for my terrible anxiety.
