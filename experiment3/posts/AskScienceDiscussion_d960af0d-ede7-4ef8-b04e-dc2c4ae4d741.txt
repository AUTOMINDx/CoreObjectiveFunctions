Is there a scientific reason that the UK and South Africa are not comparable when it comes to Omicron outcomes?
So could someone explain this to me. 

We keep being told by scientific advisors that UK is not comparable to South Africa because they had a lot of prior infections. Around 70% of Sotuh Africa have been shown to have evidence of immunity. 

But, the UK has fully vaccinated 70% of all eligible adults. 50% of all eligible adults have now had 3 doses.

On top of that we weren't exactly Australia, we have had 11.3 million confirmed Covid cases, the real number will be at least twice that.

As of the 8th of December [95% of all adults in England](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/antibodies) show Covid antibodies indicative of immunity in a random sampling of blood donations.

Other than the median age of population difference why aren't we comparable?

Apologies if this is too long for this sub, but I couldn't make the question much shorter I don't think.
