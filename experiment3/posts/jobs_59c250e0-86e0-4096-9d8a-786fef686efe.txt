28 male never had a job. Just apply for first job. Asking for interview advice
Im 28 and just applied for my first job. The job is at two different grocery stores both stock. It said no experience needed. I have no experience with interviews and afraid they will ask why i have not had a job yet.

I have bad anxiety and just let it control me. I have rarely left my house since high school. This is my fault. Now i wished i had forced myself sooner to get a job. But iam wanting to better myself and have made goals. My first is to get a job.

I am asking for interview advice. I live with my grandma and if they ask why i have not had a job i will say i have been taking care of her.
