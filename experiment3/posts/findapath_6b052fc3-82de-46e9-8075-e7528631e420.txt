Stuck in analysis paralysis late 30s
I am actually quiet happy in my career path, but stuck in where to steer the ship from here. I went into technology with a second degree in CS in my early 30s. Now I am a program manager/ product manager call it however you want it in IT in a non software company. It is saturated and I am having a hard time to switch company to something I would enjoy more (from an industry perspective).
Now I wonder if I should deepen the technical side: Continue Technical Program Manager/Delivery Head or pursue a Solution Consulting/Business Development and sales route.

Both sound fun as I love the business side and meeting customers but I realize how much bullshit there is to deal with politics and sales. On the technical side I realize that my foundation as weak, but there are more opportunities as there is giant lack of peopleâ€¦

I am super scared to become irrelevant in the next 5 years.
