Does parents feel sad when they see their kids grown up
Every time I talk to my dad he says how proud he is and I am currently 20 years old and I haven’t lived with him since I was 16 years old (my choice I still have lots of love for him) and every time I bring up something new or exciting he seems almost sad but still really proud and he says it’s just cause I’m growing up and I don’t see him a lot since I’m in college 2 hours away.
