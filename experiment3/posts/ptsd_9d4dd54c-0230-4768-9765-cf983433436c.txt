It’s been 2yrs since horrific accident. I only seem to be getting worse.
Dec 23rd 2019 I was on my way home from picking up a Christmas gift for my wife on my motorcycle when out of no where a vehicle struck me from behind which I recovered from but then was struck again in which I lost control of my motorcycle and both the bike and myself was dragged underneath a HhR which continued on. The women opened the door and said I got what I deserved and then proceeded to pull forward and when that didn’t work she tried to pull backwards. I suffered major injuries a shattered left leg and a de-gloves right foot along with a separated shoulder. It’s taken 2yrs for my physical injuries to finally heal although the pain is still there and my left foot will never look normal again. She only received a No Insurance Ticket. I’m at a loss of how to put this all behind me, My wife tells me she can’t fix me and I need to figure how to fix myself. I’m in desperate need of advice or Atleast a direction in which to head too.
