What would happen if protons, neutrons, and electrons kept accumulating in a single atom?
I read that the heaviest elements are produced artificially. What would happen if there was some environment, maybe inside or a star or some weird set of circumstances in space that caused particles that make an atom to keep accumulating “infinitely” or as long as possible. What would the resultant element be? Is there a prediction of the properties or such an element?
