Brian Greene said the mass of the visible universe is about 10^53kg. Will it get lighter as galaxies recede away from us because relative to our space theirs is moving faster than light?
Another way to ask, in a very long time the expansion of the universe will leave only the local group or other gravitationally bound objects to the local group will be seen. Eventually, it will just be Andromeda/Milky-Way' Triangulum, \[rest of local group\], their satellites and collision debris.

That would be a lot less mass. With the visible universe shrinking, it seems it would weigh less every second. (Visible universe is the part we can ever see)
