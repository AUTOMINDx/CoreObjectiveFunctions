PTSD and Memory Loss
I know this has been touched on here but I’m 18 and one thing I’ve noticed with my PTSD is when it really spikes up (more nightmares, hypervigilance/anxiety) I have trouble remembering anything at all, not even to do with forgetting memories of the event, just anything. My memories are basically an inkling of knowing I have to do something but not being able to place what it is, and even if I do remember I remember it wrong, I’ve shown up at parties days early on multiple occasions, rocked up to work at the wrong shift times, forgotten things I’ve agreed to do, I lose everything and it’s so embarrassing and everyone can see my memories are bad because my coworkers are constantly reminding me of things (which is kind of them and I appreciate it) but I’ll still forget or get confused, I don’t like being unreliable. I’ve always been an organised person and I like to be prepared but it’s almost impossible with how shocking my memory is lately, I have almost no capacity to absorb information and I’ve just become the girl who forgets everything.
