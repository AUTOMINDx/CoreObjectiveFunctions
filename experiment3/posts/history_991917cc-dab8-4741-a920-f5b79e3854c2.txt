Why are Stuart Era drawings so distinctive?
I’m talking about those little ‘cartoon’ sketches of groups of people that all seem as if they were drawn by the same person and often have little snappy captions to describe the scene e.g. ‘newes from Scotland’. I’m aware it may have something to do with the newly introduced printing press/using art to convey a political message but still can’t make out why everyone of those drawings is in exactly the same style? Also does anyone know of a special name given to this particular type of art because I absolutely LOVE the style and want to find more - thankyou!
