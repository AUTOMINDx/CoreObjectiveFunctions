I thought the relationship IS the therapy?? So confused.
I had a slight rupture with my therapist and it led to a larger conversation about the therapeutic relationship. 

She said that while it is important to talk about the relational part of therapy, we also need to focus on the “content” of our work because that is where our goals are. She said if relational therapy was the goal, we should have agreed on that in the beginning of our work. 

This therapist sells themselves as an attachment-based therapist specializing in complex trauma. I have CPTSD from developmental trauma. 

I told her I was totally confused. To me, I always thought the relationship IS the therapy, and any conversation we have about the therapeutic relationship is equally, if not more, important than the content. 

I was under the impression that the “content” of therapy (ie my depression, anxiety, unhealthy coping, etc.) was merely the fuel to get the relational part of therapy going. And most of the “healing” will actually be in the therapy relationship - since the underlying problem is my fucked up attachment system. 

Am I crazy? I feel like I’m losing it. This feels like 101 stuff to me. I’m so baffled. Is this person not really an attachment-based therapist or is she making excuses for the rupture? I don’t get it. Thanks.
