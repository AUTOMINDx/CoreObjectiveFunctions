Tough time at a funeral service
Hey all. I work as a part time funeral service attendant. So far I've only encountered the aged or chronically ill descendants. Tonight however I saw a  mid 20s fellow who committed suicide by gun shot to the temple. Almost a year ago I was in his shoes. I had the gun to my temple, loaded, finger on the trigger. I saw his mother scream and rage. I saw my mother in her. I was able to pull through my depression with therapy, meds, and a support system. I feel so much guilt right now. Guilt for putting people through that. Guilt for him laying there. Guilt for my mom still having me but his mom missing her baby. I just need to vent. I know the pain he felt. I know how it is to have no way out. And I tonight I saw the aftermath. I hate that my mom almost went through the same. I hate that he had no one to help him through.
