Hello Reddit, today is my birthday and since I have nobody by my side, I will share it with you.
My 19th birthday to be clear. I have no real friendships and that is why I am stuck lonely. It is a very bad feeling when you congrat some people to their birthdays and they just seem to forget you on your own birthday. I don't want to life in that way any more. Could you guys tell me how to get some real friends?

Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind words and congratulations. You really made my day a lot better.
