The ego is destructive. But having no ego makes you a target.
One realization that has made me really confused about the idea of having an ego is that it seems like a necessary thing in order to succeed in life but at the same time, it makes you a huge jerk. But not having one makes people look down on you and view you as "less-than". How do you develop a healthy ego that isn't rooted in insecurity? For me, there have been times in my life where I get a drive to improve myself or get good at something but when that happens, I get really egotistical and competitive with people around me and so I have suppressed that part of myself so I don't push people away. But I can't help but feel that by doing so, it makes me shrink into the background and I don't get noticed. I get overshadowed by other people who have big egos which in turn makes me resentful of those people. I do have confidence issues for sure which contributes to it but I also don't want to put other people down to make myself feel better (because doing that doesn't make me feel good). How do you balance maintaining a healthy ego without it getting out of control and making you an unbearable jerk?
