Grateful for this and similar forums!!
Just feeling grateful that my cPTSD, neglect, trauma etc etc, is being felt and worked through at a time when there are forums like reddit.

This must have been so hard and confusing - being so lonely before

I felt that loneliness when i started therapy, but the forums have been a lifeline after

particularly it has helped me realise how crap my first therapist was - waste of 4 years

anyway, glad to be here and grateful for all of you
