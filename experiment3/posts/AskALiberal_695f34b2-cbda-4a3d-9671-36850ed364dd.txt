Fully admit: I'm not smart - why can't we do something about the supreme court?
I loved Pete B's idea of 5 liberal, 5 conservative justices and then 5 mutually agreed upon by the 10. 

Why can't we force something to happen on the court? Just watching people's rights evaporate, watching tax dollars being pushed to fund religious ideology, and just watching the train wreck of civil rights abuses coming forward ...what can actually be done about this?
