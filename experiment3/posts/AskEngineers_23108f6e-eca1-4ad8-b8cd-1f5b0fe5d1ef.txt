Did I ruin my career by moving into supervisory roles? FOLLOW UP
About a month ago I was panicking about my career choices and made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/qbu713/did_i_ruin_my_career_by_moving_into_supervisory/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). I received a lot of feedback and comments and I wanted to do a quick follow up (if that's allowed):

I just accepted a new role as an engineer in the same town I'm currently living in! Additionally, there is room to grow as an engineer or transition into management based on the interview. And it pays a full third more than my last job. I could not be happier and wanted to thank the fine engineers that reassured me during what felt like a huge and terrifying crossroads in my life. Thank you!
