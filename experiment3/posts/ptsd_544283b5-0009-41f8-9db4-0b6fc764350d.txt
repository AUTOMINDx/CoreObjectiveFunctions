Has anyone ever told you they could tell from your eyes you look like you’ve been through shit? (TW rape)
I never used to get this comment before I was raped, it happened years ago and the PTSD has subsided massively by now. But I get the feeling that my trauma hasn’t just affected me psychologically but somehow physically as well to the point that when people look me in the eyes they see a hint of sadness (even when I’m not a sad person nor am I depressed anymore), even if they barely know me I’ve had this comment.

I’m just curious to know if anyone else has had these comments as well? I haven’t heard it from just one person but several.
Or have you yourself noticed it in others when you look into their eyes that somehow you could just tell? As though this “spark” which may have once been in this person is just gone? Like a lingering mark of trauma just remains in the eyes, even for those who have recovered.
