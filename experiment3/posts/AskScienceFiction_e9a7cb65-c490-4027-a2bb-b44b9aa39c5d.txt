[Marvel] 'I Can Do This All Day' - Steve Rogers only said this in private situations, so how is it well know enough to be the basis for a song?
Far as I can tell Captain America said, 'I can do all this all day' three times:

* In a back alley fight in the 1940s
* In a secret Russian facility fight with Iron Man
* In a fight with himself in Avenger's Tower

Three very private situations, not a lot of people around

So how is it famous enough to be made into a song for Rogers: The Musical?
