Getting back into social life after years of self isolation
Hi!  so:
As an underachieving ex-gifted kid i had serious depression from ages 18 til now (22), during which i started to fully isolate myself, my only social contacts were my parents and a few online friends (as well as one very devoted childhood friend)

After therapy and working on myself HARD for years, i feel great now mentally and physically, but i dont know how to rebuild my social life or meet new people.


The childhood friend i mentioned invited me to drink/go clubbing with him and some friends of his, but i only went clubbing once in my life and i feel like this would be a little to much for me for now.

Even if i go somewhere with a friend or aquaintance im usually scared shitless, trying to not be too awkward

Just to clarify- Im not socially inept or anything, definitely a bit rusty when it comes to speaking to people i dont know but thats probably it.
