How many of my fellow females here on reddit got at least once sexually harassed in their life? I feel like it is a lot more common than most people think.
Hello everyone,
I saw a post on reddit which stated that only some women/girls get sexually haressed but i actally think most have experienced it at least once in their life.

I experienced it both in rl and online (23f)

(PS. I know men can also get sexually harassed which is absolutly not okay as well)
