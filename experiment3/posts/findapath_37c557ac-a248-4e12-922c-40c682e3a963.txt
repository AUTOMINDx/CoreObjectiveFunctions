23f with a useless degree seemingly stuck in retail (I sell supplements.) I’m in a a management role, but I’ve been trying to get a different job since I obtained this one almost a full year ago! I need advice on how to change fields
I don’t know what else to do! I got my degree in health and wellness-so basically nothing. It was easier than premed and felt more useful than art but at this point what’s the difference. I’ve been working in supplements for years, and I’m now a manager at a local shop. I need to get out of my health themed retail job but nothing that will hire me pays enough? 

I currently make $22/hr looking literally to do anything that isn’t sex work or sales for more. Any ideas? Anyone know anyone with the same sort of background as me who was able to get to a different field and make more money?
