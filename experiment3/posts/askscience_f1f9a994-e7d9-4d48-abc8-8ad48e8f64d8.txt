How does a wild animal population naturally recover from an STD outbreak?
Wouldn’t a population be perpetually infected and/or die off as a result of STIs? In the case of animals that engage in casual sex or polygyny, I’d expect STIs would be even more easily spread. 

This NCBI article [Disease and the dynamics of extinction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427566/) concludes that extinction events due to an infectious disease is relatively unusual… 

Without any anthropogenic intervention, hepatitis could easily wipe out troops of bonobos. An outbreak of syphilis would wreck havoc in a pod of dolphins. There may be survivors that recover and possibly develop a resistance…. provided they don’t get reinfected, the disease doesn’t mutate, their reproductive organs aren’t compromised, etc. So, what’s the science behind a species surviving from an STD outbreak in the wild kingdom?
