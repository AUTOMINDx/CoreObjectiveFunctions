I am a wreck that needs advice…
I (20 ftm) feel as if I am going nuts. A month and a half ago I had moved out of state away from my abusive family.But I feel so alone without them. I was a sheltered child, barely going outside and barely had internet or TV until I was 15(?). I was of course, heavily abused by my mother (alcoholic/narcissist). I had finally left during thanksgiving of 2019 when she had physically hit me on thanksgiving day. I had moved in with my grandparents. But they were bipolar , putting me up and tearing me down at my weakest. But they loved me. My father should have his own post. 

Now that I’m in another state, I new place, alone. I’m even more depressed. I haven’t had a good hug in a while and I’m paranoid even when I’m alone, I don’t talk to people out of work. Everyone is nice and even my family is being nice now. I feel like there’s something wrong with me, like I was making it all up in someway. Like I was wrong about something. Like everything they did I made up. I know it’s not but it’s so hard. 

I need advice. How do I deal with this? I can afford therapy right now but I’d like to ease it a bit.
