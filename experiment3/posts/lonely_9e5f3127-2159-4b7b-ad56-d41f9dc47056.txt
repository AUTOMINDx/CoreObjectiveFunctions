Desperate for intimacy.
I could make a long post about this and my life, but I won't.

I'm just lonely (hide your surprise). Never had a relationship. That's really the only thing wrong with me, but it fucks me up. No trauma, no parental issues, doing well in school, no intolerance for being a trans girl...

But being lonely fucks me over. I feel like all the rest is pointless, and I let myself be so vulnerable on the Internet as a result. Desperate for doms, hypnotists, catfishes, anyone who I can have a connection with, even for a moment.

Does anyone else do that? Does it even make it worse?
