Boss wants me to slow down at work
I have been working a lot and getting work done. Boss said they are concerned with my mental health and told me to take a break and slow down and try and work less. As an adult, we need to pay the bills. I cannot afford a pay cut at all. Working overtime helps me and my family with bills.
