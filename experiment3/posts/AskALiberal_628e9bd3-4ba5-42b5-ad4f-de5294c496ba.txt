If Trump is indicted for racketeering and fraud, because of his financial crimes, will that keep him from becoming the GOP nominee?
David Cay Johnston seems to think so...

...Me I'm not quite so sure. Sure being under felony indictment should be the death of any POTUS candidate...but this guy has survived many "fatal" mistakes and blunders and even blatant corruption.

I don't think Trump has a chance in a general election he is very weak politically...

He lost the last midterms and the last POTUS election..by a lot

Let alone his financial/criminal exposure or whatever political/legal damage done with the 1/6 investigation. I'm still not sure if he would get the GOP nomination.

I guess **the real question is, will there be any candidates with the guts to run against him** and his dirty campaine style and the fact that he leads in all polls.
