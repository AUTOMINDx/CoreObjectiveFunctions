I love my therapist
She’s professional. She never pushes any sentiment or advice either way. She’s honest and compassionate and kind. She’s well educated and ethical. She listens to my cry every week for a year and always provides me warmth. 

She’s honest and she is so differnt from me in so many core ways and yet is 100% there for me as a professional counselor and has my best , healthiest interest at heart. 

Appreciation post bc we need more therapists like this in the world
