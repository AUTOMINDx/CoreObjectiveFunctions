To what extent do people have the right to someone else’s labor?
Asked this on r/askconservatives but I’m interested in hearing the liberal position as well.

During discussions surrounding certain social policies (I.e. universal healthcare), I often see conservatives, especially libertarian conservatives, say that these programs are immoral because people don’t have the right to someone else’s labor. 

For example, I’ve heard conservatives say that people don’t have a right to a doctor’s labor. Another example could be the whole “gay wedding cake” situation.

However, on the flip side, everyone has the right to a trial by a jury of their peers. We also have a right to a lawyer. Wouldn’t that mean that jurors and lawyers are forced to provide their labor to others? What about judges? What about firefighters, police, mailmen, or even state representatives?

So, my question is, to what extent do people have the right to other’s labor? Where do you think we draw the line?
