I’m (F26) feeling a little smothered by a new person I’ve started seeing
I’ve recently gotten out of a 4 year emotionally unhealthy relationship and have been single for a few months. I started to see someone about a month ago, which started out pretty amazing but have been feeling more and more overwhelmed by it 

I wanted to be single and date for awhile after getting out of my past relationship so I could fully process it and feel good on my own again but when I met this guy I really liked him and felt like we had so much in common. Some things that happened though that now I’m feeling we’re probably too soon was that he took me to let his grandma within the first two weeks of knowing him, he asked me to be his girlfriend on the third date, and I’ve met his family and he invited me to Christmas. 

Last time we hungout he asked if when we had a house together we could get specific lighting in it and is talking about travelling together. He asked for the password to my phone and will randomly pick it up when we’re sitting beside each other to look something up without asking me. He constantly tells me how much he likes me to a point where it feels like it’s a bit too much. He also just got out of a relationship so I’m not sure if he’s trying to just jump back into something but when I ask him he assures me that’s not what it is. We’ve only been seeing eachother for one month. Is me feeling smothered a normal response from not being sure if I want a relationship or is he coming on strong ? I’ve also been honest about being unsure if I want a relationship at the moment and feeling overwhelmed and he said that he likes to moves fast and that I shouldn’t be afraid of being hurt.
