Would cancelling all US student loan debt tank the economy a-la a subprime mortgage crisis?
Basically title - isn't it possible that cancelling all student loan debt would tank the economy? what if our debt has been packaged, sold, and speculated upon by banks a-la subprime mortgage crisis? wouldn't value just disappear?
