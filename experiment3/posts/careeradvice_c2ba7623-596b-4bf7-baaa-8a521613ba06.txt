Anyone else not interested in the "corporate ladder"?
Personally, I just want to find a good paying job. But I have no interest in climbing the corporate ladder. I'm not career-oriented. I don't want to live to work. My passions are things completely unrelated to work. I refuse to work 60-80+ hour work weeks, work outside my scheduled hours, just in hopes of getting one tiny step up the ladder. Also when you move up, it often means longer hours and more stress/responsibility, and often with little to no pay raise. Who needs that? It makes sense if you have a family or are planning to start a family. Personally I don't really want kids, so there's no incentive for me to move up.

That being said, if there's an opportunity to move up without working longer hours, without working outside my scheduled work hours, and without added stress/responsibility, but with a decent pay raise, I'd definitely go for it. However, for most jobs that does not seem to be the case.

So for me my main goal right now is to find a decent paying job that I can do well in and will provide a good work/life balance.
