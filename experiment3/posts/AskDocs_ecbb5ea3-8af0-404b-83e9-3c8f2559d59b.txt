28F. Told perhaps 2 weeks ago that I'm not pregnant. However, told today that I am. How did this happen?
I took 2 positive tests over 3 weeks ago. 2 weeks ago, I had a bit of bleeding and then 1 test being positive, the other being negative. The out of hours wanted me to be checked for an ectopic pregnancy. When I went to hospital, the urine test was positive and the blood test wasn't. I was given an ultrasound, to what they told me they couldn't see any signs of pregnancy. At that point, the pregnancy should have been 6 weeks. They claimed that it was probably my kidney problems causing the urine tests to be positive and cysts causing the bleeding. I have CKD and endometriosis. Previous ovary torsion.

Anyway. Today, I had a scan to observe my bladder and kidneys. I was told I was pregnant, measured at 7 weeks and 5 days. I'd accepted that I wasn't pregnant and feeling pregnant must have been psychosomatic. I don't know what to think now.

My questions are:

How was it possible to have a negative HCG blood test at that point?

How come they didn't see anything on the last scan?

Edit: In the UK and BMI is 17. I don't know imperial measurements.
