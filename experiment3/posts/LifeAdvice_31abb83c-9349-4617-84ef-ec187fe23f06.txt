what is life
i’m so damn fucking broke and i can’t save money for crap and i have to mentally brace before work because i get so much existential anxiety. im 17 and i don’t have a family anymore i live with my older friends i thankfully met. i don’t ever feel happy i upset my girlfriend 24/7 and it feels like life is just one empty room. i don’t know what to do, i hate work i just can’t stand life
