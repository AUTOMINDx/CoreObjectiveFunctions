Reproductive autonomy and child support
I've been recently reviewing for myself the arguments for reproductive autonomy, as this became the center point of recent political developments. The core of it, as best as I can say it, is that since pregnancy and childbirth pertain exclusively to the mother's body, the decision to bear the child has to be up to her only. The wishes of the father play no role, since it would infringe upon the bodily autonomy of the mother.
This intuitively seems like a reasonable ethical and legal framework.
However, it occurred to me that this has a strange side effect in the converse case, namely if the mother chooses to bear the child despite the father's wishes to the contrary.
In that case, the mandatory child support often present in law seems unethical, since in this case it effectively penalizes the father for matters beyond his legal control.
I've looked into this, but found few scholarly articles addressing this, much less ones without obvious political agenda outside of the question itself.
My conclusion seems strange and counterintuitive to me - am I missing some relevant factors here?
