How th do I learn to clean?
I’m a 17yo living with parents. My parents have almost zero knowledge in cleaning, they have poor understanding of hygiene and cleanliness. Can’t blame them, I’m sure their parents don’t know it either. 

Sooo I want to learn how to clean my house. How are you supposed to clean floors? Can you vacuum wooden floor? Do you mop the with just water? How do you use cleaning products? Do you have to disinfect surfaces? How do you clean glass and mirrors? How often do you have to clean? How do you remove dust? What to with dust on couches and on furniture with textile? I’ve heard you shouldn’t mix cleaning products, how do you prevent that? How much product do you use? How do you clean sink? How often do you clean? 

I have sooooo many questions and I’m really confused and don’t know what to do. I tried to google and research but I don’t understand the articles and how do you actually clean because there are no examples with videos. And most of the stuff on internet is more like “5 tips for cleaning”, “try this new cleaning methods” rather than a detailed, structured step by step guide for beginners. I have adhd so I often struggle with following guides and instructions. I live in Central Asia, there are no cleaning lessons and I don’t know anyone who can teach and help me. 

Please help me. I want to learn to keep my house clean and also not spend too much time and energy on it. I’m a university student, also I have to help with my parents’ business, I’m supa busy, I have limited time and energy. Also I’m depressed. 

Please share resources and advices, I need help
