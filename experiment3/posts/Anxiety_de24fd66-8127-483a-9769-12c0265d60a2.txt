Yesterday i went outside in the city for 45 min!
I have had depression and anxiety for many years now and it was a long time (maybe years) ago i was outside and talking and having a conversation with someone at all, and yesterday i talked with a person for 45 min! It might not be alot for some people but to me it was huge, i am so Happy and proud :)!
