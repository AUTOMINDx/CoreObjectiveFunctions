I [23M] stopped taking 100mg of Sertraline around 5 days ago because my insurance ran out. I have been getting a lot of vertigo and keep hearing sounds when I move my eyes. Does that go away? Would it be worth it to see a medical professional?
Also I recently exposed to Covid, Im sure that might also be part of it. Any help would be great because if this isn’t that serious Im not trying to pay ridiculous out of pocket expenses to see a doctor.

Edit: Also I should say that I’ve been experiencing a lot of covid symptoms like body aches and congestion, I just haven’t been able to secure a test from anywhere yet.  
  
Edit: I appreciate all of the help guys
