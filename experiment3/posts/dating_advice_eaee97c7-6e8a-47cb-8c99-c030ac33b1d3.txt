she cheated on her bf and now I feel like shit
quick story. my ex cheated on her current bf with me a few nights ago. I didn’t know they were dating at the time, but found out after. I feel like shit now for helping her cheat because I feel like karma is gonna come back around on me. My question is do I tell him she cheated or just leave it?

edit: I have proof of us hanging out in form of a picture with a time/ date stamp. you only hangout with someone @2am for one reason. I also don’t live in the same state so I’m not terribly worried I would get my ass beat.
