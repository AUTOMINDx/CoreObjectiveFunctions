Was just discharged from ER with a healthy heart today yet I still have crushing pains and can’t even do basic chores.
25F, 150lbs, 5’4”, no drinking drugs or smoking. Omeprazole, klonopin, nitroglycerin (for chest pains), hydroxyzine. 

I went to the ER today for crushing chest pains that kept me awake nearly all night. I got a clean bill of health, two EKG’s normal, chest X-ray normal, troponin levels good. They gave me aspirin. I left still feeling the same. 

I came home. I did laundry, my bedding. When I was putting my bedding back on my bed, I became so out of breath and the crushing chest pains came back. I almost passed out just making my bed. I still have the chest pressure. Took a nitroglycerin and it helped the pain for like 30 minutes maybe? Now I’m laying here with crushing chest pain right where it was this morning. Right in the middle of my sternum that kind of branches out to the left side under my breast. Back hurts, short of breath upon walking, head and limbs feel heavy. 

I have also had a persistent dry cough with this pain, and coughing actually relieves the chest pain. I just read that coughing to relieve chest pain is indIcative of heart failure? I wouldn’t be surprised because it really feels like my heart is failing. 

How can I get told repeatedly my heart is okay but I almost pass out and have crushing pains just making my bed? This isn’t just anxiety. I’ve had so many EKG’s done, so many chest X-rays, blood work, bp is always good (diastolic is always near 90 however), oxygen is always perfect. Also had a chest CT a couple weeks ago that cleared me of pulmonary embolism. 

I’m afraid I’m going to drop dead. Please help me, I’m begging someone to help me.
