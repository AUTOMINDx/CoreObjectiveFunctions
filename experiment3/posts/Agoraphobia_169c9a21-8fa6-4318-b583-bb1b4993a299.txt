I am crying tears of joy after finding this subreddit
I have never had mental health struggles before, until two years ago I had my first panic attack and haven't felt the same since. I recently moved across the country to a new school, which has really made my fear of leaving the house worse because of COVID and I don't know many people here. When I go outside, my vision gets blurry (not really physically but I disassociate), I become conscious of my breathing, and have to walk home. It is hard for me to even go on class or on a date, but I still try my best. My anxiety has been so bad in the past few weeks not only because of my grad school thesis advancement, but I thought I was slipping from reality and "going crazy". I just feel so seen, and am now inspired to seek treatment :)
