Applying to first job post-PhD - How long should a research statement be?
Basically the title. I am applying for an academic job as observatory staff. It's a permanent research position but distinctly separate from the institution's tenure track Astronomer positions.

The job ad readsÂ (emphasis mine)

&gt;Please submit with your application a short Cover Letter, CV (PDF files preferred), and **a statement of research interests and plan covering a 3-5 year horizon.**

How long should a statement of research interests and plan be? I do not want to apply with something so short it is dismissed or so long that it is not read. 

Is 2-3 pages reasonable? Or should I be thinking 10 page grant proposal?
