The film’s over and I’m stuck in a theatre I can’t leave
The best way I can describe how I feel in my life is:

That I’ve watched a full, feature length film in a movie theatre, it was good, I enjoyed it well enough… but now the film is over and has been for a few years but I’m not allowed to leave the theatre. 

I’m stuck in some “afterward” existence. The feeling that the main part of my life is over and now it’s just waiting things out. Nothing fulfilling or particularly happy to come, that it’s all in the past. 

I can move around and interact in theatre and there are some people who still come and go but again the film has ended and the lights are on. There are fewer people here than ever before though none of them really interest me and vice versa. 

I’ve felt this way for about a year and half or more. Not sure how to get out of it. 

In reality, I’m successful at work and am generally healthy. I have 2 great kids and am divorced. 

I’ve been in and out of therapy for few years but will probably start again. 

Any helpful words is appreciated.
