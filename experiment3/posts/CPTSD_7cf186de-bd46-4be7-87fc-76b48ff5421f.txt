I did it! I survived a full year without trying to off myself!
After a religious suicide because of homophobia, I am back. I survived! I turned my life around.There are still problems but I am going better then how I was going before!

If anyone whats a hug, I will give you one! I might be a bit late but I will try my best!

Thank you all so much for the support!
