What is the most masculine hobby a man can have?
Edit: Thanks for all the great answers! Didn't expect to get so many. Just to clear up some confusion - I am not taking up a new hobby. I'm also not seeking any sort of validation. I was simply curious, what hobbies are nowadays considered the most "masculine". Some of y'all got offended for no reason. Peace!
