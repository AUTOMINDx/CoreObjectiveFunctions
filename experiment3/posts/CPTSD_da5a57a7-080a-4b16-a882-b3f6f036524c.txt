Why does childhood abuse turn some of us into narcissists and others into empaths?
Something I have been wondering about for a while. All of us here have been horribly abused. Why do some people shatter and become abusive and narcissistic themselves? Why do others become kind and caring and try their best not to hurt others?

What differentiates the two? I haven't found much about it even after searching a lot?

Perhaps empath is a wrong word to chose. My point is, some abused people are kind while others are not. Why so?
