Please learn to just walk away
I've been lurking for a long time and I can't believe how ridiculous the hot posts always are. I find myself HOPING that they're fake. Either they are, or a good bunch of people need to learn relationships 101.

If everything tells you she's cheating on you, yes she is. If your "suitors" send mixed signals, no they're not into you. If he cheated on his girlfriend with you, obviously he will cheat on you later. If she's emotionally burdening you, yes you need to stop being a therapist for her and no she's not ready for a relationship.

This sub is a circus, how can people not understand basic stuff like this? Please get a grip. This world is tough, the dating scene is tough, so you need to be strong and respect yourself in this kind of situations. Learn to walk away when someone is harmful. 

There are dozens of people out there who are a good match for you, there's no such thing as "the one", and if she/he is being suspicious she/he isn't the one anyway. And even if you don't have dozens of options, remember you only need one... Therefore you'll also survive dropping one of them.
