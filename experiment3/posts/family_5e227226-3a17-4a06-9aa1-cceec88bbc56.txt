my unintelligent mom putting all her money into bitcoin after watching youtube videos
Before the crypto lovers come at me, I work in finance and understand it quite well, it's not about that but the reckless process of watching youtube videos of charlatans, taking them seriously and then deciding to actually follow through.

Wondering if anyone has dealt with this.

My mom has always had a very child-like mind, she is quick to anger (the kind of person to get mad at employees for no reason), and bad at ever reasoning things through. When I told her I thought the youtube videos were nonsense she got extremely upset at me for disrespecting her.

The reason it worries me is financial stability, my mom has never really worked a job, she divorced my dad and got his house almost 20 years ago, which she was able to sell for a couple million. She should be able to live off this  but as you see, overnight bitcoin investments without strong thesis, the price can quickly go down 20% and she might panic and then goes 20% of her entire life savings..

Maybe not looking for advice as much as rambling, my mom is honestly a horrible person, no friends, always angry, very mean. etc. But finding this situation kinda ennerving just to process, that your own mother could be fooled so easily by charlatans on youtube.. and when you try to explain things, she gets angry at you for not respecting the youtube vids   hard to describe but not a good feeling.
