What do you call a research paper that only summarizes the state of a field or subject area using existing research without providing any new research beyond the analysis of the state of the field or subject area?
Hi, I feel like this is a super dumb question, but I'm drawing a blank, and Google isn't helping me.

I've occasionally encountered articles that do not provide any new studies conducted by a researcher and serve only as an analysis of the state of a field or subject area. Is this ringing any bells? Or is my memory not serving me well?
