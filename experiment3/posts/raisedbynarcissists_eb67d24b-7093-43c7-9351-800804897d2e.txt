Does anybody else’s nparents make you pay bills etc just to live with them?
My parents force me to throw 600 for mortgage just to live with them plus also pay money for grocery and cable bill. If you don’t then you can’t live with them. I just find it ridiculous because that should be your parents job to provide for you without you worrying about all this adult shit.

EDIT: I’m 19 and I’m a college student working part time
