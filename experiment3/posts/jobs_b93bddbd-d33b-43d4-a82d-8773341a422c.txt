Did your company give you a Christmas bonus or any kind of present?
I started working at a new company this year and they did not give us anything versus my previous company. I'm just curious.

Edit: Hi everyone!! Thank you for sharing your experiences!! It was so intriguing to read the comments - I read each one and appreciate everyone who commented. I hope you had a wonderful Christmas. 💕✨🎄
