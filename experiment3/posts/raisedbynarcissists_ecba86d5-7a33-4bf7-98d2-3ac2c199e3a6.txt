I ruined Christmas by getting COVID
I have pretty bad COVID symptoms so I decided to get tested yesterday. My Nmom decided to call my aunt and say that I “go to the doctor for every little sniffle” and she thinks I’m going to come back positive because “the government wants numbers to go up” (everyone is entitled to their own beliefs but I’m having BAD symptoms. Shortness of breath, horrible cough, fever, headache, stomach issues. So I know mine isn’t a false positive.) When I came home I got my test result and it was positive. I let her know and she goes into this huge rant about how “I’m so sick of hearing about COVID. This is all bullshit. And now no one is going to come for Christmas!” She also is telling me that I don’t need to isolate and that I still need to help her with stuff around the house. AND SHE STILL WANTS TO HAVE PEOPLE OVER FOR CHRISTMAS! She’s acting as if I just have a cold. She is scolding me if I’m trying to rest or taking any meds.

No sympathy. No “can I do anything for you?” No care. No love. 

I HATE HAVING A NARCISSISTIC MOM!!!
