33 days sober: my journey and what I’ve gained so far!
So 33 days ago I was in a hospital bed I had been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis. I am 26 years old and have a beautiful two year old at home. My life was absolutely crushing around me I have been in and out of detox and felt like I could not stay sober my last relapse was absolutely horrifying. It was truly a wake up call.

Since I got out of the hospital I have been dedicated to my sobriety completely I have not had a sip of alcohol in 33 days and let me tell you some thing I am so proud of myself. While I am still in early recovery I’ve noticed benefits already. 
•I am much more present with my son and ENJOY being with him
• my sleep has improved
•I’ve lost 10 lb
• skin is clearing up as well as my eyes (I was totally jaundiced)
•people are coming back into my life 
• my energy levels are up 
• I have a great sober community
• I am rediscovering old hobbies 
• mood is improved 

I will not tell anyone how to go about their own recovery but I can share what is working for me. I go to a peer recovery center close by that offers free groups such as stress management yoga women’s and men’s groups art therapy exercise group and book clubs. I also attend AA meetings I have not gotten a sponsor yet but I plan to. 
I go to weekly therapy to delve into the issues of why I did drink which I find very helpful and I surround myself with sober people. Most importantly I keep things in the moment because the moment is all we have. 

Thank you if you read all of this. This group is truly inspiring and powerful❤️
