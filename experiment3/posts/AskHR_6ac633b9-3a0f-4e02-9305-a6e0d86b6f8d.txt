[DC] Over 9 Months since I left my last job, and my previous employer has not responded to my requests to return their company property, not sure If I can dispose of it.
I left my previous employer (a large firm, 20K+ employees) over 9 months ago. When I left, I was told that I should receive a box in the mail to return all of my company property (laptop, id, card keys). I was also told explicitly that I should not attempt to return it in person (due to COVID). Thing is, I never received a box. I've tried contacting them several times at different emails and phone numbers, but still haven't heard back from them on how to return it. At this point, I'm inclined to believe they don't care and I can just get rid of it. I don't want to do anything wrong, but I don't want to keep lugging this stuff around when I move to a new city. Any ideas on getting ahold of someone? Can I just get rid of this stuff?
