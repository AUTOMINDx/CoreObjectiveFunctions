Would you tell a new engineer to stop asking questions and start working weekends?
I've been working full time as an engineer now since I've graduated in May. I was interning at the same company for almost two years before being hired on.

During my initial performance review, one key takeaways were that I need to stop asking for help/questions so often and that I should look into remoting in on the weekends more if I don't get enough done during the week.

These two really struck a nerve with me. I have over a decade of experience from the military and I've filled a number of positions. As a supervisor I would never tell a subordinate to stop asking for help or asking questions. This was only a few months after being hired and I've been trying to take in as much information as I can.

Then they tell me that I should try working on weekends. I am a strong believer in work life balance and will refuse to work on my time off unless it's a life or death situation. Some of the people I work with will work on the weekends or work from 9-7 every day or even later. I don't want to do that.

Am I alone in feeling like this? Is this the type of feedback you would give a brand new engineer? What steps should I take moving forward in my career?

I've been reading through everyone's comments and I really appreciate all of the help and guidance! I'm going to take this advice and help it to push my career forward. It seems like I wasn't alone in how I felt about the situation but there were areas that I had a blind eye to. Hopefully I can use this thread as motivation to keep improving!
