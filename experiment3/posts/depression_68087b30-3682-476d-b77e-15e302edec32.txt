I don’t want to get better
When people tell me I just have to “move on” from my problems and start to improve, it makes me feel worse about myself. It makes me want to crawl deeper into the hole I’ve made; I don’t want to do anything. I would rather sit in my sadness than try to do anything about it. It’s pathetic but knowing that doesn’t make me want to change anything. I don’t know how to explain it. It’s not like I enjoy being depressed. I just won’t get up. I won’t.
