I just turned 30 and I'm spiraling
I have no idea what to do with my life. I feel like I've wasted a lot of time and should have figured it out by now. I have an associates in criminal justice and I'm 3 classes away from having an associates in science and really don't care about either of them anymore.

I want to help people. I want to make a fucking difference. I feel so radicalized and angry about the state of the country and I just feel like I'd be happy if I felt I was making a difference, even if it's a small difference. I'm so tired of working jobs making money for assholes who don't care about anyone but themselves. Sorry that this got a little rant-y but it's how I feel.

If anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your input! It's giving me a lot to think about. I've started looking at some non profit work that actually pays more than I make now so something might work out :)
