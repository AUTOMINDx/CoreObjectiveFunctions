Brother and I share accounts, is he still getting tracked? Safe in general?
My name is Art and I live with my brother Adrian who's a few years younger than me. My family's never gotten seperate devices for the children, so we've always shared not only devices but also accounts even if they were managed overall by one or the other, since generally we were never smart enough to manage multiple computer accounts (as such this will likely be a throwaway).

With data tracking and all that becoming as big of an issue as it is, my question is is he able to be tracked seperately from me despite the whole account stuff? Our interests are fairly individual from eachother so I've been paranoid about stuff being compiled on him.

He's autistic on top of other things so I've always been a little overprotective of him, but I do feel this is something within the realm of reasonability.

Any response would be appreciated. Thank you so much!
