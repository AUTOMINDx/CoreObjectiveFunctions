Why and how does it make sense for the governments to have a budget deficit? Just like an individual shouldn't government also save some money, but it's negative in most countries. I know they print money digitally but what is the problem when government spends less than revenue.
I also want to know some consequences of too much deficit, no deficit and surplus.
