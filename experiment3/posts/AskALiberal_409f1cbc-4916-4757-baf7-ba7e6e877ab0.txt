How can United States liberals ensure midterm success in 2022?
Okay, on the one hand, Biden and Congress have passed some pretty epic legislation including another Covid Relief package and the Infrastructure bill (the later with Republican support). This shows that he can get things done. and I would count these as major successes. 

On the other hand, the BBB is not getting done this year and has been watered down, inflation is being seen as a major issue and Republicans are running and winning on a platform of immigration fear, CRT and other culture wars crap. 

Virginia, NJ and elections in states like PA (where I am from) show Republicans are fired up and have done well recruiting. 

In short, things are not looking good but there is still potential for victory. So how do the Democrats save themselves in 2022 and by extension 2024?
