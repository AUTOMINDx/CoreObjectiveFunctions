Why do my friendships reach a saturation state very early?
This happens especially in the case of girls. Me being a guy, approaches them, we talk, we text and that's it! A ton of girls have shared a lot of their personal stuff with me over text or over call but it hasn't really gone any further.

Edit: Some of you have really picked up the point and have very resonating suggestions, thanks for that!
And for those who are confused, all I am saying is 'not every time I want to get into someone's pants, I just want some of my female friends to be atleast like my guy friends. Hanging out, Video Calls(if not in the same city), Not ghosting under the pretense of mood swings.
