Pearl Harbor at 80: My Grandfather's story as an 9 year old eye witness.
As told to me in 2012:

"71 Years ago today I had just turned 9 years old, and was in the 4th grade.. The president had previously issued an ultimatum to the Japanese to get out of Burma and this was the deadline day. (China was our friend then) Hitler was raising all kinds of hell in Europe and England. (Germany was our enemy then)(Japan was our enemy then)

Joe Louis was heavy weight champ of the world, and as far as I knew always had been.

Roosevelt was President of the United States and as far as I know always had been.

Jesse Owens was still a national hero after the 36 olympics, and Jim Thorpe had not had his medals returned.

June of 1940 I was put on the USS Mariposa to go live with my dad in Honolulu. He worked for the government at Hickam Field and lived in Hickam housing.

On the day of Dec. 6 he worked from 4:00 till midnight as the Army Air force had decided to move all the instruments from one hanger to another. I rode my bicycle from the housing to the field about 8:00pm and took him his dinner.

The next morning I was playing out in the front yard, when all of a sudden these small airplanes with brilliant suns painted under their wings and on their tails flew over our house about 50 feet above ground. They proceeded over the housing and I could hear the bombs and the guns when smoke erupted from the field. The planes would then turn right over Pearl Harbor and soon there was heavy black smoke everywhere.

I went to wake up my dad, and told him what I saw. He said it was just military maneuvers and not to bother him. "About that time another zero passed over and he jumped out of bed. He put me and my step mother into a 1939 Pontiac after gathering a few clothes and we were off to the mountains where he had friends. Our car was strafed by a lone plane and had about 6 holes in it, but we were not hurt.

After dropping us off in the mountains my dad returned to Hickam and we did not see or hear from him for 4 days. He related that the Hanger they had emptied the night before was totally destroyed, and the one they moved to was untouched.

I remember lying on the floor in front of a big radio with a big green eye in it telling us what had happened and that the government was fearful that there might be an invasion. In June of 1942 I was placed on the USS Lurline and returned to the US to live with my mom where I lived happily ever after. (Through both democrat and Republican Presidents)"

When I asked my grandfather more about it, he said:

"A few days after returning to Hickam housing, I rode my bike to the main gate of Hickam field. The guards were armed with sub machine guns. A 1934 ford with 4 Japanese men approached the gate and were told to halt. They accelerated instead and the guards opened fire killing all 4, the car swerved out of control and rolled over. I can still see that in my mind"

I asked if my grandfather would have ever come back to the mainland if that hadn't happened. He said:

"Not sure. Even tho my dad had remarried, my mom was trying to get to Hawaii , but the only way was by boat which was hard to do on $4.00 a week"
