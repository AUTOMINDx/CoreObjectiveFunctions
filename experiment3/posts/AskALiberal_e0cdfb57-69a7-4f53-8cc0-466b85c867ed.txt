It’s been 22 months since the first identified US COVID case. 780,000 Americans have died. Why are rapid test kits still 25 times the price compared to Europe despite Europe not offering any subsidies?
Psaki was asked about the admin’s approach to making rapid tests more affordable and she just mocked the idea of sending people weekly test kits.

The admin recently announced that private insurers would cover the rapid test cost, but this leaves out the uninsured, those with Medicare or Medicaid.

FDA is dragging its feet on approving the test kits. Seriously this was the same problem that led to 6 weeks of COVID spreading in February and January of 2020 undetected in the US.
