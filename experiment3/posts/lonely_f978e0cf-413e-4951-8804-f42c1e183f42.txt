Please stop telling people to "learn to be ok with being alone." ALL primates are social creatures and humans are not an exception.
We live in such a left-brained and egoic society that it is going against our true nature as humans which is to be unified in a social group and to spend quality time with people that we value.  Why do you think no matter how much these self-claimed self-help gurus (who often have spouses and tons of close friends) want to spin out BS about how "people need to be ok with being by themselves" that loneliness still persists. This is not the kind of life we are supposed to be living. Nobody seems to care either. They only pretend to care when you die and shed fake crocodile tears when the truth is even when you were alive, to them you might as well have been dead.

No other primate on this planet lives such a lonely life as humanity does.
