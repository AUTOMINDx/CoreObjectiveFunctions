What happened to you between Fri-Tue and which house is ruled by Capricorn in your chart?
In other words, which part of your birth chart did the Venus-Pluto conjunction hit?

Make sure to mention if it makes any tight aspects to other parts of your chart and whether you're using Placidus or Whole Signs. I'm curious how this affected everyone!

As for me, my 10th House (career, public image, etc) is ruled by Capricorn. On Friday, when Venus-Pluto went exact) I had the WORST job interview of my life. Made me depressed all weekend and had to reflect a lot on my future. I normally consider myself to be an articulate, intelligent person, but I was so nervous that I became a rambling idiot. My ADHD took over lol. What's worse is I'm actually super qualified for the job and still think I would've been great for the position, but I completely messed up 90% of the questions they asked. FYI transiting Venus-Pluto was also exactly conjunct my Moon and opposite my Mars.

Your turn!

EDIT: I should note that the Venus-Pluto conjunction is still happening so feel free to mention anything that's still going on! Fri-Tue was only when it was exact.
