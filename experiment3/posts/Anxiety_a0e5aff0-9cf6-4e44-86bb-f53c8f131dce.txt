Climate change is currently giving me massive anxiety.
I feel really stupid for this, and I think it's just because I don't know anyone that gets anxiety about this too. 
I recently have been getting massive anxiety about global warming. I feel like all I ever see is how we're all going to die because we aren't making enough progress and how we barely have any time left.
It's honestly so frustrating for me because I feel so helpless. I'm a teenager, I can't really do anything substantial about it. And it seems like even though there's so much bad that will come out of it, nobody cares enough to do any. 
Worst of all, my parents make me feel stupid for feeling so anxious about this stuff. I always feel like it's my fault for feeling this way because of them. 
I haven't had therapy in months because of health insurance, and my medication hasn't been working very well lately. I feel so stressed and anxious and I dont really have anyone reliable to vent to.
