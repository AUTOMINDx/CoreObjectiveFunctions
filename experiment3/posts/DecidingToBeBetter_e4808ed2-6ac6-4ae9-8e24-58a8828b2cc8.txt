Spent the first half of 2021 becoming “that girl”, spent the second half losing that by pining over a guy that’s emotionally manipulative and simply not worth it. Dropped him, and we are back to our scheduled programming 💜
Just want to remind EVERYONE that if you feel like you’re losing your sense of self when dating someone, the person you’re with is not worth it! Separately, if they treat you like an option, they are also not worth it! Finally, if they put in way less effort than you, they are not! worth! it!!!

You are worth so much more than being in a position of continuous self-doubt. The highest of highs are not worth the lowest of lows with people like this, and you deserve better than to feel like you’re not enough, because you are.

As for me, I just got my hair done, I’m continuing therapy (and, using the techniques I’ve learned in therapy to be here for myself), I’ve stocked up on my skincare/haircare and am committing to getting back to my routine, and I’m meal planning for the first time in months (doing this so I finally have energy to get back to the gym and so I can start nourishing my body again, because I’ve been so anxious because of this person I haven’t been eating). The only two people I’ll have in my life forever are God and me, and I’m excited to get back to acting like it. 😌
