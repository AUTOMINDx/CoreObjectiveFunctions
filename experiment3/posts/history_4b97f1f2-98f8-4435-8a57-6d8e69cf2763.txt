The legacy of Napoleons invasion of Egypt
After listening to the fantastic “rest is history” podcast on Napoleons invasion of Egypt, I have suddenly become fascinated with all things Napoleon.

He appears to have instigated the first of what we might know call “Liberal interventionist” foreign policy of the kind practiced by Western powers over the next 200 years in such places as Vietnam, Bosnia and Iraq. (If any can suggest any earlier examples do let me know?). France, a country having recently undergone an enormous social and political revolution, felt the need during their invasion of Egypt to not only conquer the land of the Nile Delta in order to cut off the land bridge between the Mediterranean and India for the British, but also also expunge the enlightenment values of “Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité" to the bewildered Egyptian subjects.

I am particularly interested in the long term legacy of the invasion, both on the French and the Egyptians, if anyone  has read any good books on the subject do let me know. I have listed a few examples below of the impact below on the two countries.

France - discovered field of Egyptology, Birth of orientalist movement for 18th century (see galleries dedicated in musee d’orsea and Lourve), expansion of French presence in North Africa (with ramifications to this modern day, as the tension between secular France and Islam persists)

Egypt - rise in European ideas of nationalism, liberty and secularism , weakening of ottoman state, modernization efforts of later rulers such as Muhammad Ali (pivoting long term towards western methods) and ultimate failure to withstand European colonialism (the country becoming a British protectorate after First World War)
