Fake medical reason not to drink alcohol
So I don't drink alcohol, for personal reasons. The company Christmas party is this afternoon and it seems getting drunk is de rigueur. What sort of medical reason can I use not to drink that won't come back and bite me in the rear later? Can I be allergic to alcohol? I'm male, 45
