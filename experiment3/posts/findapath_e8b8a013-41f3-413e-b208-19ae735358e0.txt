Is it possible to get your life together in your 30s?
I am 30 and still working on getting a Bachelors and a certification which I will hopefully have in 6 months or so. 

I still live with my mom and am unemployed. I feel worthless and like an unimaginable failure. Can I turn things around or is it too late?
