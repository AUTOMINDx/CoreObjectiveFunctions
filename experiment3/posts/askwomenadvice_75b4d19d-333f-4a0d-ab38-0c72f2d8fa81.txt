First time for me and my bf tomorrow. Any tips would be appreciated.
Me and my bf are gonna have sex for the  first time tomorrow, basically we're still virgins. It's just as the title says. Does anyone has any tips to hurt less, what lube should we use, what kind of condom should be bought. What precautions we should take, Anything helpful and tips also would be appreciated, thank you!
