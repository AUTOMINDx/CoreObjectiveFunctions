In the middle of a job interview, can I ask the recruiter to have the job be based out of New York while I'm in Chicago? I'm looking to move.
I'm (26M) currently in the middle of a job interview. I'm getting the final round of my interview scheduled for early January 2022. The job I'm interviewing for is based out of Chicago, where I currently live. However, my girlfriend (26F) recently got a job in New York and is moving there in March. I would like to join her in New York but to do that, I need my job to be based out of New York as well.

I want to make sure I can at least secure the job in the company I'm interviewing for since it's a good opportunity for me. I know this company can relocate me to New York after a year but we (mostly my girlfriend) don't want to do a long-distance relationship for a year. 

Since the company also offers the same position in New York, is it a good idea to tell the recruiter halfway through my interview process to see if this job can be based out of New York? 

Or do I look like a candidate that is already planning to leave the company soon if hired in Chicago, thus ruining my chances of landing the job in Chicago and in New York?

Should I wait until I finish interviewing and receive a potential job offer before presenting the question of whether this job can be based out of New York?

Please help!

Thanks!
