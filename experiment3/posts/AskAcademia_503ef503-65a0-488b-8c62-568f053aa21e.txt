When did you start writing your PhD thesis?
Social Sciences PhD Candidate here.

I'm about to defend my project proposal. But I have a lot of literature in my Zotero library, I am thinking of starting to write the literature review chapter. Is it too early to do that since I have not yet begun recruitement and data collection?
