Healing really boils down to having money.
Either you have it and you maybe can heal. Or you don’t and you definitely don’t heal. 

Want to establish safety? The first step in healing? That takes money. Money for electricity, a toilet, a shower, refrigerator, a roof, privacy, a door you can lock, Heat. 

Want to talk to a therapist? Go to a doctor?  Money.

Make healthy connections with people? Participate in society? Money. 

Do self care? Buy a warm coat? Eat a healthy home cooked meal? Take a hot bath? Money. 

Even getting a job takes money. If you are healed enough to tolerate working. 

Etc etc.
