How to explain to interviewer that the reason I applied is because I want to be remote?
I’m curious if this looks bad? My work is transitioning back into the office, and I honestly just prefer working from home. No hour commute, I get more work done.
The posting I applied for is remote and in my same field, I’m just worried that using “I want to stay remote” as my only reasoning doesn’t look great.

Thanks!
