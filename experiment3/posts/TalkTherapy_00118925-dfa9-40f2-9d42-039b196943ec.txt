My T accidentally triggered me
So in session yesterday, which had nothing to do with my SA trauma, my T was trying to get me to try asking an open ended question (we are working on a few relationship issues I'm currently having) and I said I couldn't do it, he said something like yes you can, give it a go, I said no and he pushed again and I just completely freaked out, I had the worst and most intense physical sensation of pins and needles spreading up whole body and static noise rushing in my ears and my vision started going weird and I just started crying and repeating "I don't feel right, I don't feel right" obviously he stopped and helped calm me down. At the time I had no idea why I had that response. T tried to ask a few questions, was it about my relationship we were discussing,  no. I realized after I left session that it was the experience of saying no and having a male keep pushing my boundaries that triggered me, and it was related to a SA when I was a teenager.  I emailed T and explained what happened and how freaked out it made me etc but now I've had no reply. It's common for us to email between sessions,  and he encourages it because of my trauma and upbringing I struggle with opening up. Anyway now I'm worried he thinks I blame him for triggering me or he thinks I'm to needy etc etc
