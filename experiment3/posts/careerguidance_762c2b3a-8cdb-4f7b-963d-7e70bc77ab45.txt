Below market salary for job?
I had an interview yesterday and I believe it was going well, up until they asked what I needed for salary. I told them “based on my research of similar positions in the area and based on my experience/education, I need a salary of XXX”. When I finished that sentence, there was an awkward silence for a bit then the HR manager said “well our range is between XXX-XXX and I haven’t seen anyone get that much for this position” 

Their salary range is roughly 25-30k below average market value. This is an amazing company and I would love to work for them and they said I’m moving to the final step in the interview process which is a great sign. I just don’t know how to tell them that they are not paying fair market value for the amount of work they are wanting. What do I do? Do I tell them that the salary they are offering is unreasonable or just see what the next interview takes me? Thank you!
