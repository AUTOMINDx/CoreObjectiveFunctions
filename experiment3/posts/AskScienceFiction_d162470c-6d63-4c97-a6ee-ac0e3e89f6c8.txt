[Comics] Why do so many animal only themed shapeshifters or " powers from the animal kingdom" characters like beastboy, Vixen, or Reptile make this weird distinction between non sentient and sentient animals? if beastboy can turn into a Kryptonianian dog then he should be able to turn into a
humanoid Kryptonian as well as regardless of intelligence/ sentience  they're both still animals.  They should be able to shape-shifting into humans to as were still animals
