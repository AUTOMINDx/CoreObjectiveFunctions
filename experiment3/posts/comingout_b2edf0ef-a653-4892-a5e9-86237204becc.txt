I(M32) discovered a sexual attraction to men. I want to tell my wife (35F) but I am terrified for some reason.
Short backstory: I got married in September to the love of my life. She is accepting and wonderful.

However in the last few weeks I realized that I am sexually attracted to men, but not exclusively and not romantically. As crass as it sounds, I just want penis.

I grew up in a homophobic household in a homophobic place so deep down these feelings have always been there, but suppressed. Every time I tried to explore my thoughts on this I would have an anxiety attack and push them down. 

Recently I faced them, and came to this conclusion. I know that I probably will never be able to fully explore these feelings now that I am married, since the idea of "cheating" on her kills me. Maybe one day I could ask her how she would feel about that, but she doesn't even know this about me. Hell, I didn't even know this about me until a few weeks ago when I realized I had been hiding from this for too long.

So I decided I should start from the start and tell her.
I just don't know how. Or where to start. Or anything about this. 

I know she would accept me for who I am on this, but it's so hard to get out from under the voice in my head that been there my whole life telling me how wrong my feelings are. Just telling anonymous strangers on the internet has my stomach doing flips right now....

Does anyone here have some advice, or anything at all, to help me get past this anxiety?
