How can I (nicely) ask my girlfriend for more sex?
I feel like there is a discrepancy between my sex drive and my girlfriend's. Often times it is a little frustrating. I start teasing her and give her a few kisses in the neck. But when I try to move further she cuts me off. Am I doing something wrong? How can I ask her for more sex?

Edit: Thank you so much for all the advices and for sharing your stories. I am new in reddit and literally this was my first post. I wasn't expecting this many responses. I was trying to reply them all, but it became a little hard after while. One important take is that, I was feeling awkward before posting, but now I see that so many people faced the same problem as I did so I guess its kind of a common issue among couples. I am taking some valuable suggestions at heart and I will try to deal with it. Thank you so much, you guys are awesome!
