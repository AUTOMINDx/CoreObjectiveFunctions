1 month off PPIS
It’s been 1 month off PPIS. I feel great. I still avoid milk. Nothing else triggers me. I went to a buffet, a big party, ate during thanksgiving, and more. Absolutely no issues ! 

I did have a weird wet acid burp but no symptoms or issues right now. I think it’s from me drinking a lot of water in a short time.
