Is regret common after the first session with a counselor?
I met my counselor for the first time last week and immediately started worrying about the interaction, her reaction, that I did not communicate a cohesive case, that I am misattribting the cause of my symptoms to childhood trauma (not top-tier abuse, but not normal experiences either), that I am not a good candidate for therapy or that I'd said too much. Is this common?
