I did not realize that I made fun of people by making it funny at the same time!
That’s something I recently found out. I realized people like us tend to bully others and make others feel bad due to the lack of empathy and it giving us supply but I thought I never did this because I got beat up pretty hard when I was young for making fun of people. 

Hence the subtitle “covert” because I make undercover backhanded compliments and turn it into something laughable, a joke. I’d also smile while making the joke because I know smiles are infectious so at the same time they’re smiling because of empathy and they’re feeling like shit afterwards. 

Like the other day I picked on a tall girls height saying she should be in the nba and apparently afterward it made her want to be short and ended up in her screaming like a total toxic feminist would (this is what made me aware).

I’d pick out imperfections in people like the example below

The day I picked on my coworkers patchy ass beard who hes been working on for months. “Aye come on man what’s with the patchy ass beard you tryna pull a chick?” And I’d always smile at the same time while giving a little laugh so they’d know I was trying to be funny but in actuality I was hurting their feelings by making themselves insecure about their beard.

Obviously some things have it’s limits so I don’t get in trouble (or beat up again god forbid) but thankfully I’m tall and muscular so maybe I can go over the line sometimes if the person is smaller than me. Who knows. 

This feeling I get associated with that is supply?!? Damn I didn’t even recognize it lol. 

I make other people feel insecure because I feel insecure. And in an indirect way it makes me feel better about myself because it alleviates the pain due to comparison. Huh. Weird.
