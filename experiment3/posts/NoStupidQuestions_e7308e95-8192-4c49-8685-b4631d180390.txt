Why do Americans rake the fallen leaves from their yards instead of just keeping them [to use as a mulch]?
I don’t get it. I mean it’s what nature does, decomposes. Not to mention it’s putting nutrients back into the soil.

Why go through all that trouble (or even moreso, pay someone to do it) when it’s best to just leave them?
