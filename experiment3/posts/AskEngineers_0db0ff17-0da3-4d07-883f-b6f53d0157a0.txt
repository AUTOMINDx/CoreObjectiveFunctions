Two teams are trying to convince me to stay. What do I do.
Hey guys. I’m a graduate engineer. I have a masters in mech eng. 

Basically. I’ve worked as a systems engineer in rail for 7 months. They’ve stuck me on mundane asset management work which is literally just simple data entry. I’ve become really irritated with it and I’ve had conversations with another team in building services. They’ve offered me the role. It’ll be as a mechanical design engineer. 

My team have heard about this. They’re now trying to get me to stay. They’re offering me better work. Better roles. They’ve said they ‘want to give me a dilemma and a hard decision to make’. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve never experienced this kind of thing before. No one’s ever wanted to keep me before. 

Any advice? Thanks
