Why did writing systems of the Mesoamerica Native groups not spread to North American Native groups?
Looking at other groups of Europe, Africa, and Asia writing systems usually spread due to trade networks and I was wondering why the same was not true for North American Natives? There were definitely instances of exchange of technology and social ideas, but as far as I am aware there was no exchange of writing.
