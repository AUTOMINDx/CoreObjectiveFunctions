In what non-career ways have you found your path?
Just a curiosity. Please share anything you want, from finding the country you want to live in to going vegan to adopting FIRE or minimalism to finding a passion for astronomy. Anything where you finally came across it and thought "ah hah, this fits me like a puzzle and this is a permanent path that I will adopt".
