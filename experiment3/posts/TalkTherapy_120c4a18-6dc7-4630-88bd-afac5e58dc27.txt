Therapist won’t let me stop my sessions- please help
Thanks for any help in advance: 

I reconnected with an old therapist via telehealth during covid. She was somewhat helpful in my early 20s when I saw her in person. 

Now, I’m 36 and I do not feel she’s doing anything at all for me, and she’s actually made some comments that were extremely insulting. (Ie. I had an abortion and she said I must have wanted to get pregnant….!?!?) 

Additionally, I pay out of pocket $225 / session and it’s kind of killing my finances. I attempted to stop my sessions and told her that (leaving out the part about how I’m not happy with services anymore) and she wrangled me into continuing. She’s also charged me twice now for appointments that I cancelled way in advance. 

Please help me figure out how to end this. I need some ideas on the best way to go about it without being a total asshole.

Edit: I sent an email stating that I would be terminating treatment. I got a text response later on that she was “shocked at how abruptly I ended things.” Deleted it and do not plan to respond. Thanks to everyone who commented and got me to a place where I felt my concerns were valid and could do this. 💛
