Ex-bil doesn’t want me to treat his kids differently
I (42f) spoil my nephew Chris and spend a lot time with him. Chris is my late sisters son. My sister died when he was 5 after a heart attack as she had a undetected heart condition. Chris spends a lot of time at our house where my parents/his grandparents, husband, 2 daughters and 2 sons also live. Chris has his own room in my house and has his own set of keys, he comes and goes as he pleases. Chris also has great bond with his cousins who all consider him their brother. As far as my husband and I go he’s also our son and is included into everything we do with and for our kids. He goes with us on all our vacations and this year my husband and I bought him a car for his 16th just as we did when our eldest son turned 16. My parents and I also plan on paying his way through college same as his cousins since ex-bil could never afford to.

Ex-bil wants me to include his other kids (2 teenage stepsons and his 2 boys and daughter with his wife) into our time with him. His other kids often get jealous of all the attention and money we spend on Chris and his wife feels like I’m driving a wedge between the kids. Especially as their oldest son Tom also wants a car but again ex-bil and wife can’t afford it. They want me to make Chris share his car with Tom. I told him I would not persuade Chris to share.

I’m not even going to lie but I don’t like ex-bil I certainly don’t like his wife and their kids are obnoxious mean little shits but I obviously never treat them in an unkind manner and I don’t allow Chris to speak to them or about them in a disrespectful manner. Even though I know they all constantly exclude Chris,purposely break his things and make him feel like an outsider.

I don’t feel like it’s my responsibility to consider the other kids ex-bil has and at the moment I don’t know how to deal with the situation and any advice to make Chris’s life more comfortable I’d love to hear!
