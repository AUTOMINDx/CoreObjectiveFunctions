Can someone please clarify what gender identity is?
(This is no doubt a sensitive topic. If you have strong reactions to my post, at the very least please read it. You may find it to be more nuanced than you'd expect).

I've been struggling for a while to understand what exactly it means to be transgender. 


Most people agree that gender can be defined as "the range of characteristics pertaining to and differentiating between femininity and masculinity." The debate is centered on whether femininity and masculinity are innate or socially constructed. 

If you believe they're innate, then men and women are--by and large--born with masculine and feminine traits, respectively. In other words, male and female babies are anatomically *and* psychologically different (i.e., their brains are wired differently).

If you believe that masculinity and femininity are socially constructed, however, then, **by definition**, boys and girls are are not more likely
than the other to be be born with masculine or feminine traits, respectively (i.e., they're genderless). In other words, male and female babies are anatomically different but, on average, **psychologically identical**. **Society**, rather than biology, assigns gender at birth and conditions male and female babies differently.

Now, it makes perfect sense to me how transgender identity is consistent with the belief that gender is innate. For the most part, biological sex and gender align at birth, but, on rare occasions, that is not the case—a biological female is born with a "masculine brain," or vice versa. This causes gender dysphoria--their gender does not align with their biological sex. 

**What I do not understand** is how transgender identity is consistent with the belief that masculinity and femininity are social constructs.

First, let me clarify that I'm aware that gender identity and gender expression are defined differently. **Gender identity** is defined as one's own internal sense of self and gender, whether that is man, woman, neither, or both, whereas **gender expression** is defined as how a person presents gender outwardly, through behavior, clothing, speech, or other perceived characteristics.

An example of this distinction would be a biological woman who identifies as a man, but whose gender expression is not masculine (it can be feminine or neither). Thus, their gender identity is male, but their gender expression and biological sex are not. Being a "man" has nothing to do with masculinity or sex.

Now, **here's my dilemma**: what exactly is it that makes this person a "man"? We just established it's not biological sex or masculinity. No doubt you will say it is their "gender identity" that makes them a man. Point taken, but what is this "gender" that they "internally" know themselves to be? Literally, what is the definition of gender? 

Well, if you look at feminist literature, the most basic definition--which is not controversial-- is that gender is "the range of characteristics pertaining to and differentiating between femininity and masculinity." Using this definition, a transgender man is one who  "internally senses" that their gender is consistent with characteristics pertaining to masculinity. But this is a contradiction to our previous assumption that gender identity has no relation to masculinity/femininity.

This is the dilemma I run into whenever I try to reconcile transgender identity with the feminist literature I studied in college. I've never heard a compelling answer.

Here's a typical back-and-forth:

**Me**: if gender is a social construct, isn't identifying as transgender just identifying with a social construct (a social construct that feminists were never very fond of), and not “real”?

**Answer**: gender identity is different than gender expression. Gender identity is not a social construct.

**Me**: define gender identity?

**Answer**: it's an "internal sense of self and gender."

**Me**: Define this "gender" thing that they "internally sense" themselves to be?

**Answer**: "the internal sense" that they're a "man" or a "woman."

**Me**: Define "man" and "woman"?

**Answer**: (recognizing that they can't define "man" and "woman" based on biological sex or masculinity/femininity) "man" and "woman" are genders. Being a man means that you "inherently sense that your gender is male."

**Me**: You defined gender identity as being a "man" or "woman" and then defined "man" and "woman" as the gender you are. These are circular definitions and I still don't understand what "gender" is.


Can someone please enlighten me on what exactly gender identity is if it is completely divorced from biological sex and masculinity/femininity? I'm sorry, but defining it as "an internal sense of gender" or "being a man/woman" is not a sensical definition of gender.
