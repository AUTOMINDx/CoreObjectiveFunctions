Does anyone constantly try and figure out if their parent is drinking or not?
I’m back home for the holidays and I’m constantly trying to figure out whether my supposedly sober father is actually drinking or not. I pick up on every possible clue, and it’s not good for me. Anyone experience this and/or find a way to deal with it? Please share your recovery.
