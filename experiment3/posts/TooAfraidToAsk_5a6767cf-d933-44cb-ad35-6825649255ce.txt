Reporting stuff actually helps us, commenting “where the mods at???” but not reporting accomplishes nothing. We cannot physically read every post.
Please report stuff instead of grandstanding in your comments but not reporting. The team is active but we cannot read every post and comment. Reporting stuff brings it to the top of our queue.
