Two different girls have told me they want to be just friends in a row
I recently started getting out of my comfort zone and trying to date. I reached out to a girl who seemed interested and we went on two “dates.”


But I guess I must’ve misread some signals and she told me she didn’t want to lead me on.


A similar story with the second girl but this time I saw other signs that I didn’t see in the first girl and I was sure she felt a connection as well.


Now I can’t stop equating if all this with something wrong with me? If I can’t read signals that well, how can I tell if a girl is actually interested?
