What adaptive (now maladaptive) behaviours have you developed from having a narc parent? And how do you think these come off to others?
Like I talk fast, as I was never allowed to get a word in or was always told to hurry up when I had something to say. I expect it comes off as lack of confidence / is intense for people. 

I also interrupt when people are talking as my brain works fast for the same reason which definitely comes off rude. 

Not assertive in friendships as as a kid being assertive would not end well, I know I come off as a people pleaser. 

These served a purpose around my parent, helped keep them off my back. But they are not good in the real world. 

I want to work on these behaviours but i'm not sure I am aware of them all.

What are yours/some you have seen in other people?
