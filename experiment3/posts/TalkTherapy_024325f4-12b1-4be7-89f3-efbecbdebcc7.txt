I don’t personally like being thought of or referred to as a “client”
The term “client” makes me feel kind of like a dollar sign or inconvenience, it’s just so impersonal, which if I’m getting my hair done or going to a nail salon then what does it matter right? But therapy isn’t a business exchange, it’s something extremely deep. I’m seeing one bc I have a mental illness and need treatment for it so to me, the more respectful thing would be to see me and refer to me as a patient bc that’s essential what I am. Anyone get what I mean?
