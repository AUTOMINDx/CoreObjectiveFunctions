I told my mom that I was bi
It didn’t go so well and now I feel so so horrible. I think I may be bi romantic because I can’t see a new doing a girl but I can’t see a girl doing me. But what I can see me doing with girl is everything romantic like cuddling, kissing and stuff like that. 

Me and my family are very religious and now I just feel so bad and I feel like if I have sec with a women then it’s a sin but if I romantically engage with them it’s not a sin. 

I just feel so bad and I don’t want to go to hell. I tried being straight but then I developed a huge crush on my girl best friend and how I knew was that I could imagine myself kissing her and I liked it. 

If u click on my profile you can see the posts that I made with everything. She thinks that I’m confused and that I don’t know what I’m talking about and that she kinda knew when I started dressing like a lesbian and stuff like that (I’m basically masc by nature)

I just feel like literal shit right now. I was feeling so good about myself and then boom! Sad
