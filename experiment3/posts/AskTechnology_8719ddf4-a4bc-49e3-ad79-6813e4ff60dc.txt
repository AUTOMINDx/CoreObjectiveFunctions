How is the minter of an NFT verified?
In short, what's to stop me from minting my own copy of an already existing NFT and claiming ownership? If an NFT is analogous to a certificate of authenticity, how is the certificate verified? (quick disclaimer: I'm not an NFT aficionado or anything, I just want to make sure I understand how it works)
