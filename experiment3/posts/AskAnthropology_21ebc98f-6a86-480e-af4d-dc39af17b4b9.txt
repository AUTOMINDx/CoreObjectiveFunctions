When do you become an Anthropologist?
When do you get to actually call yourself an anthropologist (or any specific kind of academic, for that matter)? Once you have a Bachelor's Degree? A Graduate Degree? When you get a long-term full-time job in the field? When you publish your first research in the field? What if you publish research as an undergrad?

The same question goes for subfields of anthropology. Am I an archaeologist if I graduated with an emphasis in archaeology? Am I a zooarchaeologist if I publish undergrad research in zooarchaeology?

I just don't want to feel like an imposter. Thanks for your input.
