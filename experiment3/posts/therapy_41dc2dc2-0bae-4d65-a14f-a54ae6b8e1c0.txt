How do I stop living in my head?
I recently discovered that something isn’t quite right about me. Every since I was a young child I have lived in my head, creating *endless* fake scenarios that will most likely NEVER happen. For some it is normal to be quite imaginative but I fear that mine is a bit overboard. 

I fear that this habit is causing me to disassociate from the real world. I’m constantly always dreaming of different life scenarios, being in positions I dream of being in one day, creating attachments to people I want to be in relationships with etc. It’s weird and quite frankly I’m tired of this. In my mind, I’ve created a completely different version of me who lives a different life than I do. I mentally create stories for “her” on a regular basis. 

I want to be more present in the real world and live the life that I’ve always intended for myself. I’m 24 now, I don’t want to look back on my life and realize that I’ve wasted a lot of time fixating on a false reality.
