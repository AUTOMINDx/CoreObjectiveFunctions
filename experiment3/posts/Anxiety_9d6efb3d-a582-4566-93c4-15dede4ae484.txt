People with social anxiety - do any of you get this weird excited energy after you’ve had a social interaction that went well?
Or is it just me. Just got off a video call which i’ve been dreading for ages, and i’ve been jumping up and down the living room going “whoop!” for the last 5 minutes and I don’t really know why 😂
