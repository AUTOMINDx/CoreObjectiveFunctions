Mid 20s hitting hard...I'm not even living life im just trying to survive
* Too lazy to do anything after work
   * WFH got me mentally exhausted. I cannot find time to decompress once im done work its an instant switch to things I have to do and worry about in the house
   * noise is just prevalent even if im working from home (pets, family members, partner)
* thinking about money all the time
   * still spends a lot on wants more than essentials
      * justifies by thinking that i can make more money out of it or money back in the long run
   * worried if I'm saving enough
   * worried if I'm investing on the right things 
      * FOMO with stocks and crypto
      * keeping up stocks and crypto news and trends
* constant worry about the future
   * what ifs and if im doing the right thing to lead to a better future...
   * am I progressing with my career
   * is this the right profession
   * should i explore and see my options but i cannot halt my income flow no matter what
* Trying to keep up with all the trends i've been accustomed to
   * Switching hobbies and cannot stick to one
   * The urge to do everything at the same time
   * social media influence and how it impacts my expectations
   * tried to stay away or drop a hobby or two to make time for other things but I seem to get pulled back in 
* relationship issues
   * initial feeling of hanging out with friends doesnt excite me anymore
   * valuing my time and making sure I won't waste it
   * living with a lot of know-it-alls doesn't help
   * partners negativity has rubbed off me
      * there's always something wrong
      * I am constantly on-the-go
      * i shutdown easy and I prefer not to do anything at all
* etc.. (I can add more but that's what I have in my head that I wanted to let out.) sigh....
