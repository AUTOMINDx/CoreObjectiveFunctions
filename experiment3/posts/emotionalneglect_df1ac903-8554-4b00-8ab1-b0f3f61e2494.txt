Did anyone else have the consistent thought pattern of "Other people deserve nice things but I don't"
Ever since I've been a child I've had a persistent and peculiar thought pattern. 

Here's an imagined scenario to try and describe it.

Imagine you're working in an office environment. You go out to run an errand and when you arrive back in the office you see all your coworkers gathered in the office kitchen. They are laughing and eating donuts and having coffee. The manager felt generous and surprised everyone a box of donuts and coffees for everyone. It was a spur of the moment type thing and you just happened to arrive back once the donuts were already laid out. No one explicitly invited you, but as a coworker you're welcome to go and join in.

If this (or something similar) were to happen to me part of me would feel like I should go and join in. I was a colleague and entitled to have some coffee and donuts.

But another part of me would recoil at the idea of joining in. It would want to sit down at my desk and pretend I hadn't seen everyone eating together. It would want to quickly turn around and leave the building and come back in 30 minutes once the donuts and coffee was finished. I'd feel a tinge of sadness and part of me would tell myself that I don't deserve to partake in the fun. That I am somehow not good enough to join in. 

Can anyone relate to this feeling?
