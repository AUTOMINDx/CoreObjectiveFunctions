[MCU] What does the world think happened to Captain America?
The deaths of Tony, Nat, and Vision all seem to be public knowledge, but I highly doubt that Steve told the world that he was going back in time to the 40s to be with his girlfriend. So what does everybody think became of Captain America? Did they think he died in the battle against Thanos or something?
