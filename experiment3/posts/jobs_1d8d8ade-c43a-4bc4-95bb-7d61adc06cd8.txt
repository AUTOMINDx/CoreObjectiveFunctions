How to politely ask NOT to be considered for future roles?
It seems this question has never been asked, but I’ve been reached out to, interviewed extensively (7 zoom calls + a full day of interviews in-person), and ultimately rejected by the same company, for the same position, twice now.

Frankly, I’m pretty irritated by how much of a time-sink this company has been, when I could’ve been focused on something else; I wasn’t even looking for a job when they reached out to me.

I want to let them know, as respectfully as possible, that I would not like to be considered further for any other roles. How can I do this?
