networking during covid
I'm a PhD student and for the second year in a row I presented some work at the top conference in my field. Unfortunately due to be being in an east Asian country with strict quarantine rules it meant that I had to present virtually and the experience was completely underwhelming. Aside from answering a few questions on the virtual platform I didn't have any interaction with the other presenters.

I feel like this has really been a squandered opportunity for me, pre-covid I would have been able to make some great connections at these conferences, especially having my name on a paper that was being presented. I really miss the social aspect of post conference drinks, side events, etc.

Any suggestions on how I can keep networking in my academic field, I've considered cold emailing some other PhD students or researchers in my field but feel a bit awkward if I'm not really offering them something.
