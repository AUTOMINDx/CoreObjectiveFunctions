When/why did Greek mythology and literature overtake Roman in terms of influence and popularity?
From Medieval times on up, Latin literature was considered the essential core of classics and the Greek stories that were studied were mostly studied through Roman translations. Roman names (Jove, Ulysses) and stories are much more common and in general Roman writers had a huge impact on early English literature.

By the present day (at least late 20th century onwards) the opposite is true. Greek literature like Homer and Sophocles are much more likely to be studied than something like the Aenid. Big pop culture movies like Disney's Hercules draw mostly on Greek names and versions of myths. 

When and why did that change happen? Was it a sudden event, or did it happen gradually as we got more access to Greek writings? My background is in Anglophone literature so I'm coming from that perspective.
