Lost and unemployed
Hello fellow reader, 
I’m in need for Life Advice. I was recently fired after 8+ years. I will have completed my Associates by next June for Cybersecurity (total career change) but I’m completely lost on what to do next. 
I’ve been applying for entry level help desk jobs to get experience and well.. a job. 
It seems I am stuck in a pickle. I don’t have the technical degree yet to get a job working on Cybersecurity and recruiters have told me I would be “underwhelmed” in a help desk job. 

Any tips from someone whose been lost and unemployed? 

Thanks!
