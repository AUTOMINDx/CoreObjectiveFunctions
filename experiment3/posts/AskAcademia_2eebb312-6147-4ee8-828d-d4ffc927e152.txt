Offered a research position last night! This will be my first time gaining any experience with research. What's the best way to stay super organized so that I can keep up and contribute with the rest of the team members in the research lab?
Hello all,

I was told from my PI to research on some literature related to diabetes and biomaterials.

I have to come up with a synopsis about it by tomorrow. 

I welcome any constructive advice and insight on how to stay organized throughout the whole course of this research opportunity. 

Also, what would be the best way to write up a synopsis?

Thank you for your help!
