Can someone explain backbutton hijacking? What is the actual mechanism? Why is it hard to stop?
Lately I've noticed all kinds of sites stopping you from being able to use the back button to get off the site. What is happening there? Is it a script? Why can't it be stopped? I want to be in control of my back button. Am I crazy?
