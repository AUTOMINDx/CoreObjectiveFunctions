Do higher birthrates promote poorer education?
I'm specifically discussing the US.

We've all heard: "the public education system sucks, they never teach anything useful, school's boring, etc.". People point to curricula, funding, culture, practices, policies, etc. These are all important, but I'm wondering how birthrate may factor in.

Assuming a consistent proportion of teachers, It should be logical that birthrate over a period directly determines class sizes, whereas twice the birthrate would lead to twice the student-to-teacher ratio.

By this idea, the population explosion should've led to an unprecedented increase in class sizes (Unfortunately, I can't find a chart atm). This would be very concerning because teachers could spend less than half as much time per student, which I'd assume lead to poorer teaching environments.

Could the population explosion have afflicted the US education system so? Since the birth rate is decelerating, will education become more individualized and improve, and apprenticeships reemerge in practice?
