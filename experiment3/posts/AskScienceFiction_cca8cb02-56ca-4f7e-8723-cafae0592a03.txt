[Star Wars/Halo] Has there every been an instance of a stray projectile from a ship hitting something way later on?
This doesn’t have to be specifically Star Wars or Halo (should’ve marked it as GENERAL, oops), but has there ever been an instance where a stray plasma/laser/etc beam has hit something or someone later on? 

I’m just a imagining a ship suddenly getting hit by a random plasma bolt, that was probably shot from a ship several years ago and some light years away. Has something like this ever happened in media?
