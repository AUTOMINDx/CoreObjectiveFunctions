Lying on bed all day, sleeping most times &amp; Watching YouTube
I have been clinically depressed but the fact that I used to not do any useful chores , just lie on my bed and watch YouTube LGBT content. I really liked to watch the representation and loved the content. Since I enjoyed watching the content, does that mean I wasn't depressed ? 
Any feedback would be helpful.
