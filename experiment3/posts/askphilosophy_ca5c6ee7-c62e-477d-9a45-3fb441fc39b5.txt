Stephen R. C. Hicks - is he a hack?
There is that book/audio book "Explaining Postmodernism" written by Stephen R. C. Hicks. After the first few minutes I get the somewhat uncomfortable impression that he is a political hack who is more interested in denigrating postmodernism than anything else. Does anyone agree? If so, can anyone recommend a good (as in serious) and preferably lengthy introduction to postmodernism? Audio book preferred. Thx!
