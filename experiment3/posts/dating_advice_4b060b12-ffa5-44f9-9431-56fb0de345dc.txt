Awkward (sex based) questions I’m too afraid to ask anywhere but the internet.
Probably NSFW so heads up. But definitely TMI. 

Alright so after spending some time working on myself , getting right with the world and my mission /purpose. I’d like to dip my toe into the dating game. Literally just looking to go on a date or two from time to time - to ensure I’m giving that dimension of my life some attention. 

But there’s one problem. Im a COMPLETE virgin at 24! Literally nothing - no action whatsoever. I got attention/active interest (“we should hang out” , “I’d like to get to know you”) but I had a lot of family stress growing up and I never pursued what I had back then thinking “it’ll come later” - well…it’s later. 

 I’m a chronic over thinker so there are questions that lowkey make me ashamed to ask but I might as well try: 

1. How does one kiss exactly?😂 is it literally just lips puckering against each other or is there some technique here I should “practice” (I don’t even think you can lmfao) 

1.5- I thought of this later before posting for the first time. But I have some kinda thing from childhood where I produce excess saliva — is there anyone out there with anything similar? Do you just constantly swallow your spit to avoid mixing with the other persons mouth like that? 

2. The pubes situation: (icky details, avoid this paragraph to avoid scarring) so I come from a family of mountain gorillas and we got HAIR. It’s nice cause my old man still has a full head of hair at his age — but that kinda growth is everywhere. Even to the point where it’s not just around the balls but on the balls themselves and dare I say on the shaft too — how immaculate does all this need to be? Do I really need to go in there with tiny scissors and get every hair on the genitals themselves? 

3. So I actually have somewhat low circulation (I’m seeing the docs) and my hands and feet get frigid cold - this weirdly worries me because the idea of holding hands or running my hands on someone’s spine rather than triggering pleasure /comfort it’s gonna be like “Dafuq- am I dating mr.freeze?” , I do warmup but it’s after a bit with a heat “source”. 

4. How does one even figure out their condom size? What measurement are they even in? Like what range is medium, large etc. it’s not like jeans where I can walk in and try one on lmao. And they are kinda expensive tbh. 

5. Sex itself - really good idea to brush up by reading? Get some techniques memorized I guess. Read up on stds? 

I know I know - but it’s precisely this kinda sex anxiety that prevents me from really getting out there. The idea being date goes well , sex initiates but I back out because I legit didn’t consider these things and it wracks my mind. 


Thanks to anyone with a little compassion and sympathy out there.

Edit: whoa you go to bed and come back to an RIP inbox ! Will definitely get back to as many people as I can where appropriate- I really appreciate the community for coming out like it has and feel blessed rn - have a good day everyone!

Edit 2: So I haven’t started answering comments (soon)  yet but another question did come to me (maybe it’s already answered) and I might keep a running list: 

6. What do I do if I discover I’m a two pump chump ? /come really fast 😂 do you laugh it off ? Transition to oral asap or what?

Edit #3: I think it's run its course - I'm seeing a lot of overlap which is good because that tells me - those things are consistent factors. I'm speechless at how much feedback I got and I was not expecting it -- I feel grateful for everyone who took time outta their day to get their input in (which was shockingly and overwhelmingly positive) - I still have a few people to get back too who took the time to write detailed answers, once my work ends tonight or more likely tomorrow. If you're a virgin like me out there and nervous- I hope some of these answers can help you. I can't think of any more concerning questions since so much of it is variable so I think I'll leave it at that :)
