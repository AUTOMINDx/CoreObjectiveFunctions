What is the greatest personal success story in human history?
What is the greatest example of a human being using their own skills to acquire more wealth, power, status, and/or influence than they started off with? 

They donâ€™t all have to be rags-to-riches stories. For example, Julius Caesar was born into a relatively privileged family, but still made accomplishments well beyond the advantages of his station, that would continue to shape human history for thousands of years. This to me is more impressive than, say, being born poor and going on to start a Fortune 500 company. 

My vote is for Muhammad, the guy does almost nothing of any long term historical importance for the first 40 years of his life, (he does handle the black stone 5 years earlier) then conquers almost of all of Arabia, founds the second biggest religion of all time, and permanently transforms the religious landscape of one of the major regions of the world before he dies. 

Suddenly achieving unprecedented major success at 40 is pretty impressive and unlikely TODAY. Let alone with the average life expectancy back then. 

What do you think?
