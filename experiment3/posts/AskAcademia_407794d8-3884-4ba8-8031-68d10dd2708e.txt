Have I been dismissed from my voluntary position in this research group?
Hi everyone,

I joined a sub-committee (\~300 people) of a large (\~2000 people) Australian research group in 2020 because I had an interest in the area of research and am commencing a PhD in the field next year (2022).

I emailed the Chair to ask if any voluntary roles were available, and I was hoping for a research-related role, but I was offered a role as "communications coordinator". The role is exactly what it sounds like - writing newsletters, advertising events via email and social media, etc. I accepted the role.

I became unwell in mid-2021 and needed surgery, so I disappeared for a few months, but then returned and explained my absence. They had written the newsletter in my absence, and suggested that I write a review of a journal article instead. I wrote the review and didn't receive any feedback. The review was not used.

I was then asked to write a contribution for the annual report, which I wrote, and didn't receive any feedback either. I saw the final version of what I wrote in the annual report, and it had been amended significantly without consulting me.

I was supposed to write the next newsletter, but I requested feedback on my writing first. I am used to academic writing, and wanted to ensure I was meeting their needs. I didn't receive a response, and didn't write the newsletter.

I emailed the Chair shortly before Christmas to ask what the future of the subcommittee was, and she said she didn't have anymore time to contribute to the subcommittee or provide me with feedback, but she admired my dedication.

Is that a dismissal? Should I remove the experience from my CV? I'm a little upset, but clearly I wasn't what they were looking for.

Thank you!
