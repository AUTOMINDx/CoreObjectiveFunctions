Worker shortage really? Why is it so darn hard to get interviews and job offers then?
About me-40 something. Many career experiences, currently working but was hoping to take advantage of "the worker shortage" and maybe find a different position. 

Not as easy as I thought. Not really getting offers for interviews. Might be in my current job for a while.
