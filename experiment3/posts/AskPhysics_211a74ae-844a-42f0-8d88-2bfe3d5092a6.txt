Purely in terms of the impact, would falling into honey from a great height be better or worse than falling into water from a great height?
This came up in a book my wife is reading; a character fell into honey from a great height. The character lived, though with an irritating cleanup needed.

Honey is much more dense than water, specific gravity of like 1.42 I think? But water has more surface tension than honey. 

I'm not sure what factor(s) dictate the speed at which a fluid can be displaced. 

This isn't anything critical. We were just curious.
