[Harry Potter] Could the Room of Requirement have created an alternative access to the Chamber of Secrets?
Initially I thought this was an easy “no”, but after re-reading the Deathly Hallows, two things struck out that make me think differently.


1.) A good impression, from Ron, speaking parseltongue was all that was needed to be able to open the door so he and Hermonie could grab a basilisk fang. This tells me that it doesn’t have to be Tom Riddle, Voldemort or a horcrux attached to Harry to access the chamber. 

2.) The Room of Requirement opened a tunnel that lead from the school all the way to Aberforth’s bar in Hogsmeade.  So the room’s limitations aren’t confined to the room itself.  


So now I’m wondering; if I really wanted a room that could give me direct access to the Chamber, would it have created one for me?
