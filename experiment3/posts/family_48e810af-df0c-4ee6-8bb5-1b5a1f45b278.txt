My mom throws tantrums to shut down a conversation. I don't know how to respond.
I'm in-between jobs right now and living at home in the meantime. My mom constantly scrutinizes me and breathes down my back. A few weeks ago she said that she should have aborted me. She is driving me up the wall. 

The first ten times, I sternly but politely asked her to give me personal space and to leave me alone. Finally, I exploded today after she violated some personal boundaries. I told her that I've already tried communicating with her and that I was fed up with her ignoring my concerns. In response, my mom turned her back toward me and ignored me. When I asked her to respond, she started flailing on the floor. I felt a bit callous but I just said, "Get up and talk to me like a fucking adult." Then she started screaming at me, then falling on the floor, then getting up, then face planting on the floor. Eventually I just walked away. 

I feel terrible about it and I hate how my interactions with my mom bring out the worst in me. Can someone please advise on how to deal with these interactions with my mom? I just want to have a good relationship with her but it seems impossible since she refuses to communicate with me no matter how polite I try to be.
