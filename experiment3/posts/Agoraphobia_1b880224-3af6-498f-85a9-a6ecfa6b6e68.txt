My mother said I don’t have agoraphobia
I developed panic attacks last year and spent an entire year barely leaving my house. Now I am able to go some places but I am constantly worried about having panic attacks. Everyday I feel like I am on the verge of one. I try so hard to control them and clearly you aren’t always able to tell that I’m internally panicking. It is ruining my life. 

We are supposed to go shopping with my aunt and I told her I’m afraid of having a panic attack. She said why would you be scared of shopping. I said it’s agoraphobia. She said “you don’t have that, you go in public” in a condescending way. I got so upset because it invalidates this horrible thing that is ruining my life. Getting a haircut was like hell on earth. I just had a panic attack last week at the park. I can’t get my nails done anymore. I can’t barely get through a movie. Yet she thinks I’m fine because I still go in public. I’m so upset right now :(
