DAE Believe that alot of social/world problems could be solved if everyone had loving parents?
Does any one Believe that alot of world problems could be solved if everyone had loving parents, I just got this hunch that every issue is rooted within our upbringing. We make laws to stop people from doing bad things but not do anything about the root cause of the issue. It's like we've all just been given a band-aid and been told yeah that will help with your busted up childhood.
