Is it reasonable to lose attraction for someone because they’ve mentioned their ex more than once?
So I matched with an awesome girl a few weeks ago and we’ve been talking everyday since. And other than the ex thing, there was nothing noticeably wrong. 

The first time she mentioned him I completely ignored that part of the message hoping she’d get the hint and stop.

The second time she mentioned him she told me how he would become really aggressive and yell at her. I just told her I was sorry she went through that and assured her I’m a very passive guy and don’t like conflict and generally wouldn’t raise my voice.

The third time she mentioned him was on the first date. She just said something like “he took me to a G-League basketball game and it was the best date I ever been on. What was yours?” So I just answered it honestly and suggested maybe she needs to experience an NBA game (we live in a city with a team).

The fourth time she mentioned him I straight up asked her “When did you guys break up, are you not over this guy or something?” And she said she’s completely over him and she still talks to him “out of respect” and that they have a history together.

Honestly I really liked this girl but this really turned me off from her. After dropping her off last night I said I’d reach out in the next couple of days but after sleeping on it I don’t think I want to. 

I have an ex and she never crosses my mind and certainly wouldn’t be a talking point in a conversation with a girl I’m trying to win over…
