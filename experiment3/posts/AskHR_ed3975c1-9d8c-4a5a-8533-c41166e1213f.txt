[NJ] Best time and way to ask for raise?
I have been with my company for over 7 years and have received an internal job promotion in year 5. We have individual performance reviews around February. We are required to write about various aspects of our performance in the past year. During the meeting the manager will go over what we wrote and tell us/show us what they wrote. Then the compensation numbers are usually shown during the meeting or a small letter is slipped to us a week after the meeting to reveal our raise usually 2%-3% annually and our bonus. 

When is the best time to mention that I am seeking a raise and what is the best way to say it? 

I’ve read that it’s best to not mention anything personal like needing more money to start a family or inflation and focus on job performance. The company I work for is big in luxury goods. I have had an offer that was roughly 30% higher from a company nearby, but I ultimately turned it down because I felt that it wasn’t as stable and the environment didn’t feel like an ideal fit. They did say that I could contact them if I changed my mind. 

Thanks!
