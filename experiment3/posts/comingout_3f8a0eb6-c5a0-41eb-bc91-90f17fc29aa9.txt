Elliot Page was and is my motivation for being me
Hey y’all! I figured that I would share with the younger LGBT folk or the folk that have not come out yet, one of my favorite speeches ever given on the subject of coming out: Elliot Page’s speech at HRC’s conference almost a decade ago. Here is the link: [Elliot Page speech](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1hlCEIUATzg&amp;feature=share)

Elliot Page was an important figure for me to look up to as a young lesbian and still continues to be an important figure as I am on my own gender identity journey (I prefer they/them)! I hope this helps someone, it is a powerful speech that makes me cry every time. 

Remember: you are loved!
