Every few months, I think about changing career paths. Is this common?
I've been involved in experimental particle physics throughout my undergrad, and this is what I'm applying to grad school for. My goal is to become a researcher at a national lab. I realize this means being a low-paid grad student, then a low-paid postdoc, for many years. I also realize this means I can't easily pick where I want to live. Above all, even though I've had great experiences in research during my undergrad, I'm terrified of toxic academia. 

Every three or four months, I think about not going into academia and going into industry, not in physics but in some other field. This "other field" always has something to do with helping others, or at least has something to do with the human body. Any sort of humanistic component. I've looked into medical physics, neuroscience, and biomedical engineering. I let go of those last two quickly because I don't have the relevant background and was told it'd be too difficult to change gears now. Medical physics is still something I'm very interested in, but when I started applying to grad schools, I put this interest on the back burner. Anyway, when I think about going into industry in a field like this, I think about the work-life balance, the job prospects, and the chance to make a direct impact on people's lives. All these factors are important to me, which is why I don't think I've been able to shake my interest in them and focus solely on particle physics.

I know thoughts like this are normal (especially as an undergrad), but these thoughts just won't go away for me. I just finished applying to PhD programs in particle physics. My PI "definitely thinks I'll get in somewhere", which is great. I should be excited and reassured, and yet I'm again conflicted. Has anyone experienced this?
