What is considered ethical in this situation
Everyone says everyone is equal and such, and no one is more or less valuable as other person.

But consider the situation, if you got to choose between saving your best friend and a random person, most people would save their best friend right? Isn't that attributing a value, that ends up differentiating the individuals?

And what is the line, to such values? Which attributions would be considered ethical in this context?

Like: "ohh it's someone from my family, we have the same blood, i gotta save them" okay fair.

"Oh it's my best friend, we been through so much together, i gotta save them" okay fair.

"Oh it's my wife/husband, they mean the world to me... I gotta save them" okay fair

But what would be considered unfair? Would saving someone because of their gender unethical? I think that probably it is.

Like, in a situation where there were 2 random persons, i probably would be more inclined to save a woman, since I'm a straight man.

While my friends said something like, "I'll toss a coin".

Yeah, i think it's unethical but i would probably do it anyway, I'm a hipocrite.

What would you do? In situations were there were 2 randoms, with differing factors, like gender. Would you toss a coin, or look for something you value to make your choice?
