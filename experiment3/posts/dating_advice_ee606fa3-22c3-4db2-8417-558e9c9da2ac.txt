I had sex with her but I’m still not interested in her
Hi everyone, I’ve been speaking to this girl for a couple of days on a dating app and the conversations were flowing good so we decided to meet up yesterday. I’m 24M she’s 29F. We met yesterday and I took her out to a bar, the date was okay ish but I felt like the conversation was flowing better on the phone compared to in person. After the date ended we ended up kissing and one thing led to another and we fucked. It is now the next day and I’ve just realised that I’m not that at all interested in her and don’t see a future with her. How can I tell her without her thinking that I’m someone that has just used her for sex.
