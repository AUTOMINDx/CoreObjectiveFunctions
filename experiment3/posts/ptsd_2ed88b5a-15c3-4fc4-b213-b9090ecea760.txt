Partner with ptsd has a hard time finding entertainment that isnt triggering. Any tips?
We found that most cooking showsnare good.  Japanese reality tv is good but i dont like reading subtitles after work.  So much fiction is focused around violence, physical and emotional, the past few years.  We just dont know what to watch.  There are some good art streamers on twitch but its not for me.  Some good stand up comedy like jim gaffigans new special is good.
