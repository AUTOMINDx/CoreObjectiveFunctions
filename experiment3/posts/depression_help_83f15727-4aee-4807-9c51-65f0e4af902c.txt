Speed running self care
A tip I realized for taking care of myself is to speedrun it. I normally sit around waiting for the energy and motivation to get up and get fully ready for bed. This often ends in sleeping in my day clothes and not brushing my teeth,washing my face, etc. Instead, if I try to do it as quickly as possible, I’ve found that I can manage. Is it a good job? No. But better than nothing. Just thought this might help someone. 

My therapist said better to halfass a job than no ass it. I’ll take that any day.
