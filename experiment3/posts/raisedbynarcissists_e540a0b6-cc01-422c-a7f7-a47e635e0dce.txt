Coming to terms with the fact that narcissists are logically brain dead and are basically conflict robots
It's like if narcissists are robots that are stuck on the "conflict" switch and are physically unable to recognize personal flaws or inconsistencies, like someone cut that piece of their brain off.

 It's crazy but true, there is really *nothing. you. can. say.* that will mean anything to them, they have already made up their mind, boom it's over. I like many others wasted so much time JADEing in hopes that maybe, just maybe, I could present the facts just a bit differently and \*click\*, "ok I see what you're saying". 

Nope, not once, never, so much damn time wasted and so stressful on myself. Hours and hours of stupid fucking circular arguments going absolutely nowhere. I feel like they aren't even really people, like some aliens who were planted on earth to lead everyone to their demise, like a dead husk of a person, looking at them and seeing absolutely nothing inside, like their soul said fuck this, left and all that's left is a conflict and fighting machine.
