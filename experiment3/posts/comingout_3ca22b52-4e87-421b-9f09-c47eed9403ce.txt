train-wreck of a person
I'm 18, afab, and a mess. My life got flipped upside down when i turned 13 and went through puberty. I had my suspicions that I wasn't straight, but my gender identity felt off limits. I told my mother how i was feeling and she said that everyone feels that way at my age, and to not worry about it as that would only make it worse. 

Flash forward to 15 years old and I had been masking my feelings with being overly feminine (makeup, clothes, personality, etc.). I decided to ask my mother if I could have a boys swimsuit and wear a shirt with it, and she got upset at me. So once again, I masked my feelings because i'm more afraid of losing people in my life than feeling comfortable.

Now i'm 18 and a total train-wreck. Not only does everyone treat me like a girl, but i have been ~blessed~ with F cup breasts, an hourglass body, and extremely feminine features. I hate everything about myself and I don't know what to do. I tried to tell my mother that i think i'm transgender but once again, she said not to worry about it and that it will resolve itself in the future.

My therapist, who i've explained my situation to, thinks i should try a binder and see how it feels. However, i'm too afraid that with my breast size it could cause permanent damage. I know I want to be a male, but I don't know if I'm trans. Do I really want to lose people i love just because i want to feel comfortable?

I hope that this made sense and that someone in this community can give me some feedback. I don't know how much longer i can live like this, something needs to change.
