WTF is coming out of my elbow?
WTF is coming out of my elbow?! 
I (38F) saw the doctor about 6 odd months ago about a small lump in my elbow that was bothering me. He couldn’t really feel it as you needed to rummage a bit for it, but was sent for xray. I heard nothing more so assumed there was nothing to be worried about. Then all of a sudden my elbow ballooned. It looked a little like a bursitis, but when it was drained, instead of fluid, only pure blood came out, despite there being no trauma to the elbow. It blew up again with pure blood, and was drained again. This time the area around the needle puncture began to break down. 4 months on and theres an open wound - a hole in my elbow 6mm wide, and it just wont heal. It got cellulitic and I was prescribed antibiotics. Today I noticed a little thing sticking out from said hole. I pulled it and out came this! It was tricky to take photos of my right elbow myself, but it’s made up of different shaped bits of tissue, of varying colours. From bright white stringy bits, to lumps of what looks like raw steak. Is this maybe part of the sack that held the blood, or the infection, or could it be the original lump I complained about? What could that lump be? All I can say for sure is it wasn’t a ganglion or fat cells. The fact that I have an open hole after 4 months can’t be good. I guess the big question is could it be cancerous? It looks really gnarly when I look at it in detail. If I pull it there’s quite a lot of it in there, and is extremely strongly attached to the inside of my elbow (again sorry the photos aren’t great, but I couldn’t pull it out with my other arm for the photo as I needed it to take the photo!). I wouldn’t be able to just pull the thing out entirely as its attached sooooooooo strongly. Any expertise would be greatly appreciated. Thank you
