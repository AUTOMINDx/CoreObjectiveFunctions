Huge &amp; fast inflation in Turkey
I'd like to know what exactly happens when a currency goes default, how they get a new currency, what happens to the economy, the loans, the citizens, the banks? How it affects other countries? What can an average citizen do in this situation? Is there any way to reverse this process, or they can only slow it down for a while so there's no way back? Thank you for your answers in advance!
