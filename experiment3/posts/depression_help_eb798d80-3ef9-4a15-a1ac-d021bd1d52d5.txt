Nostalgia makes me cry
This might be a weird question but does anyone else experience severe sadness when you reminisce or feel nostalgic about old times? When I think back to my high school days it makes me cry and feels like a gut punch. They were such pure, fun, new and exciting times. First love, best friends, high school memories. It was the best time in my life. Before adulthood and responsibilities, an alcohol problem (now sober for 5 years), working fulltime, struggling with bipolar disorder and depression. I long for the simpler days. I was so happy back then. It just feels soul crushing thinking about, and hearing old songs from the time just makes me so sad and almost inconsolable. Anyone else? How do you deal with that? It probably sounds ridiculous but these are my feelings.
