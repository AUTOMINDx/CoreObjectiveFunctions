Changing symptoms
Is this just me, or does anyone else’s symptoms change daily? Oh my goodness so today for Instance I have the air hunger/SOB feeling, yesterday I was having heart palpitations and a sore back, the day before I had the burning chest. 

But weirdly they all seem to just come on their own, like they’re being nice to me and taking turns lol. 

Does anyone else get this?
