[HI] What can I do with a troublesome employee?
I’m a warehouse manager and I have a supervisor that I am having issues with. And my boss seems to be protecting the supervisor.

I have heard from a couple of my employees that my supervisor has flat out yelled that they want to kill me and that their SO is a gravedigger. I have also heard that the supervisor has attempted to sabotage my chair by loosening the bolts.

Since I have only heard about it from other sources and I have not seen or heard this myself, what can I do? The supervisor is not really liked by the rest of the employees.

This last week I wanted to deny the supervisor leave for Friday because they put in their request on Thursday. My boss and the person who processes invoices was going to be out, so I would have to run the floor and all of the clerical. So, I needed the supervisor there. They emailed my boss and then my boss texted me to approve the request. My boss stated it’s an opportunity to “bury the hatchet” but to me it only means she doesn’t have to listen to me.
