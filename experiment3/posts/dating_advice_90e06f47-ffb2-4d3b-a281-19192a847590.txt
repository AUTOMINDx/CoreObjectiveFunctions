No matter how comfortable you might get in a relationship, take time to intentionally make the other person feel that he / she is wanted on a regular basis.
Itâ€™s easy to allow relationships to become comfortable or cyclical. Each person feeling that he / she is wanted by the other person will help the relationship stay and feel more healthy.
