Interview was very awkward and ended in 2 mins
So I had an interview and the first question he asked was why you applied and while answering ( at first I mentioned why I like the company and I my skills are related to it and I want to use my degree in real world applications….) then I mentioned I reached out to an employee and learned great things about the work and company. He started acting irritated and asked if I cold called and I said I reached out on LinkedIn. And he looked weird at me and ended the interview. 
Is it bad to say I reached out to someone in the company? I’m so confused!
