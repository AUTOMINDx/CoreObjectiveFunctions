Do you need a reason to work in a hybrid environment, partly in the office and partly remote?
I've been at my job for about a year and everyone has been remote. The manager has decided we are going to be back in the office soon, and sent a notice that in certain instances they will allow remote work. We recently met over zoom, and the manager mentioned that almost everyone has sent him an email with their scheduling requirements requesting a hybrid approach. I am the youngest by about 10 years and everyone at the company has children except me. I am not sure if the reason they are requesting hybrid is childcare related.

I want to request a hybrid approach as it helps my productivity and I have a very long commute, but I don't exactly have a specific "requirement" for a hybrid, other than I just want to. Is this something I can request? I was considering just reaching out regarding the zoom meeting and asking for a hybrid approach and let him ask for a specific reason.
