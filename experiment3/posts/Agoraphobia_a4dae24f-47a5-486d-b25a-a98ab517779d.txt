Is there a term for fear of people?
I have a fear of leaving my home cus I have a fear of people. Like I’m really scared of dumb, hateful ignorant strangers who harm you for no reason and not even knowing you.

I developed agoraphobia through an attempted carjacking situation in front of my house few years back. That traumatized me to not wanna go out and be seen.

As the pandemic happened, with so many people killing each other due to race and very illogical reasons scare me a lot too. I don’t wanna die in the hands of a dumbass who has no wisdom and doesn’t even know me.

It made me fear leaving my house even more. I feel like leaving my house makes me seen and given people opportunity to hurt me or kill me.

I don’t even feel safe in my own home anymore. I’m really scared of dying. Out of nowhere at 2am this morning, someone we were not expecting decided to ring my doorbell twice and my mother peeked and they were supposedly in a sports car &amp; drove off.

I was scared out of my mind and called the police and they say they could have the police come by. The police came by and sat in front of my house for 20 mins and drove off.

I still feel scared. And I have weapons with me but I’m still scared. I’m scared they’re gonna come back one day and hurt me. I don’t think my fears are gonna ever go away. I don’t even wanna leave my house for anything anymore. I feel like I’m going crazy. Idk what to do anymore to fight these fears. 

Back when I was young, I was really brave going out late at night always finding ways to go out and have fun. Now I’m just scared out of my mind trying to mentally train myself to be ok by 0.00001% but it feels like my progress keeps resetting.
