Why is "Chattel Slavery" so usually used to refer to southern US plantation slavery specifically?
Like if chattel means "a personal possession/property" than why don't we use it to describe slavery in say the Congo or Haiti too? It seems that slaves in those places were seen as property just the same as South Carolina, right?

Its not terribly important, but i'm just curious as to why this specific usage.
