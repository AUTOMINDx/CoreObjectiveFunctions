How much did the invention of blood transfusions reduce the maternal mortality rate?
I keep seeing references of people bleeding to death after giving birth in historical texts. 'Death by bloodloss'. So after blood transfusions were invented (and perfected in 1900!). Was there a large drop in the maternal mortality rate? Or was it overshadowed by people figuring out how to wash their hands?
