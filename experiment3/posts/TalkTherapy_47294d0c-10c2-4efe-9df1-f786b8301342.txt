Therapy isn't one-size-fits-all
With an influx of posts containing huge red flags about therapists, I just wanted to note that I think therapy isn't one-size-fits-all. 

In relation to texting, I don't think it's a one-size-fits-all. I text with my therapist sometimes (briefly) and it's extremely beneficial. Not only does it help build rapport, but also it helps me re-enter a healthy mindset, reminds me that people care about me, and encourages me to employ the really important things that therapy has taught me. Obviously, there are huge red flags with certain types of texting that have been referenced in recent posts. However, people saying that texting should only be for scheduling â€“ I disagree. As a complex patient I have found it quite beneficial how my therapist allows occasional texting, and it actually allows more progress for me. 

Of course, therapists can set their own boundaries that they feel comfortable with for this. They can absolutely prohibit texting in general and I understand that that might be really beneficial to some clients. But the comments saying that "texting used for things other than scheduling is a red flag", I believe that that is a huge overgeneralization.

As someone has posted about recently, some comments that try to set in stone what is and isn't acceptable in therapy, have been negatively affecting me.
