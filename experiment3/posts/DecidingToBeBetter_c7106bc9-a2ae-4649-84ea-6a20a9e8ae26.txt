I will be sober for the Christmas Holiday
Im done waking up with a hangover. I woke up 30 minutes ago and realized enough is enough, and poured the liquour i bought yesterday after work  down the sink. I don't want to feel like this anymore. It will be water all weekend and I couldn't be more excited to wake up and not be hung over.

Edit: thank you so much for the kind words, I'm excited to start this journey :)
