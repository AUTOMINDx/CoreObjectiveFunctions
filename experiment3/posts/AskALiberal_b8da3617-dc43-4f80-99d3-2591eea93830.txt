What would it take for you to vote Republican?
What would it take for you to vote Republican in a presidential, gubernatorial, or any kind of election? 
What policies, and methods would the Republican have to propose for you to consider them? What creditentials would they need to have?

This has probably been done multiple times,  but I only ask this because I have yet to see thread like this.
