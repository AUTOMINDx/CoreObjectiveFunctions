I can't come out to my family.
Heres why I cannot come out to my family,none of them think that being bi sexual is real,and if i ever came out as gender fluid,they would just tell me I'm just a girl,even if I masc present,or just don't feel like bothering with gender that day. Today I come on here and announce that i am not only bi, i am also gender fluid.
