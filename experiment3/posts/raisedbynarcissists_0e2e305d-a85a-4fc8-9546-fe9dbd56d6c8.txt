just learned my mom is part of a "mom warriors" facebook group
its for moms who are parents of "fucked up" children :) (my sister has mental health and substance abuse issues) wow, it must be so hard to deal with the consequences of your actions. what a warrior, what a harrowed, brave soul. heres your fucking cookie. im so pissed lmfao.

ok the "edit: " thing is a pet peeve of mine but this is an edit, lol, but im really relieved that other people here are relating to this. when i posted this, i was scared that people were going to say "at least she admits that ur sister has issues" or "at least she admits things are wrong" or something along those lines. has anyone seen that one tiktok of the abusive mother saying "u think u can hurt me? i abused my kid for 7 years and now he has cPTSD but im finally healing and breaking the cycle" its exactly like that. just the other day my mom showed me a tiktok about how alcohol use fucks up your kids and she was acting like wow, this is so insightful, look, son, at this tiktok detailing how much ive fucked you and your sister up. im so insightful and reflective. IM in therapy, all of my friends are below me because theyre not enlightened because i work so hard in therapy and im sooo aware of how much im fucking up my kids, to the point that everyday i tell my son how much i fucked him up. even showed the tiktok to other parents to enlighten them. this kinda act really creates a lot of painfully confusing thoughts within me because i dont know whether to be grateful that shes admitting to causing damage or angry that shes alienating herself from that damage or skeptical that anything is even going to change (because it never does change) or what....so having people understand and agree with my rage feels like a weight of constant uncertainty being lifted off my shoulders.
