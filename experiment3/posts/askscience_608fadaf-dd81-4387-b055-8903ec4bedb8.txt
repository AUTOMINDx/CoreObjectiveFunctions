Has the belief in homeopathy decreased within the past few years?
It seems like I very rarely hear about homeopathic medicine treated as anything other than quackery anymore. A few years ago it seemed like the Next Big Thing in alternative medicine. What has caused this, or am I incorrect and it is still widely believed in?

Disclaimer: I know homeopathy is objectively BS, just curious where belief in it is compared to 5-10 years ago.
