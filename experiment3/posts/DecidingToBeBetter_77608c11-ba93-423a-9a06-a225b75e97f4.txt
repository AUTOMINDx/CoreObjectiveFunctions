I'm not proud of myself, so I'm gonna do one thing everyday that will make me feel better.
I'm 25 and over the last few years I've drowned myself in depression and I feel stagnated beyond normal. 

I'm gonna do one thing everyday that will make me feel better, like a responsible adult. Wish me luck!
