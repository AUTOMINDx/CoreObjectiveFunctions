Continental Philosophy for a Dummy
The dummy being me, of course.

Despite having finished a BA in philosophy, and having started on an MA, I know basically nothing about Continental philosophy. (The department here is really, really Analytic.) What's something Continental I will be able to read without tearing my hair out, in order to get a "feel" (so to speak) for the way Continental philosophy is written?
