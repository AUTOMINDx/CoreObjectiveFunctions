Are people that are liked by everyone fake and manipulative? Or can they just be empaths?
I met someone that seems to be able to connect to other people effortlessy and that everyone genuinely likes.

I immediately felt like I clicked with this person but then I realized that everyone feels this way upon meeting them. When you interact with charismatic people who have high emotional intelligence, how do you know whether they actually appreciate you or whether they are just manipulating you?
