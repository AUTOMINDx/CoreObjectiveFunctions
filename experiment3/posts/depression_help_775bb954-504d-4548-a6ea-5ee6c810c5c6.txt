I started to clean my room...
I've been seeing a few posts of people cleaning their rooms, taking a shower, and brushing their teeth. I just want to say thank you. I've been living in literal trash because I've felt so unmotivated to do anything. Seeing you guys get up and try made me feel like I could do the same.  I finally got up yesterday and filled out 10 small trash bags of trash (I definitely need to get bigger trash bags but that was all I had.)  My room is still a mess but it's a start.
