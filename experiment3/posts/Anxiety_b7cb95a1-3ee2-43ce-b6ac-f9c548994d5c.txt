I just wanted to say that I’m proud of you…
for getting out of bed. For eating fruits and veggies. For going on walks. For talking to someone. For taking deep breaths and small moments to regroup. For resting. For speaking kind words to yourself. 

I need you to know how proud I am of you for waking up every single day to face your fears and anxieties. Nothing anyone says will ever take away how badass that is. 

I’m proud of you.
