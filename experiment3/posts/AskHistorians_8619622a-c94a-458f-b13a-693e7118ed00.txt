The lightbulb conspiracy (in Europe and the US) engineered planned obsolescence into their bulbs. Did the same thing occur in the Soviet Union?
So my inclination here is no, the Soviet Union wouldn't have included planned obsolescence into anything they did, but I'm curious if anyone noticed that soviet bulbs were longer lasting, or if this was ever used as propaganda or if perhaps they just had inferior technology and therefore didn't actually make better lightbulbs. I just noticed a post elsewhere with a Czechoslovak bulb from the 90s and it got me thinking...
