When the family dog passed a few years ago, was it my responsibility to tell my parents I was having a hard time or should they have checked in?
So yeah we all cried on the day and talked about it briefly then it was never talked about again. I took a long time to get over it and still haven't really processed it just ignored the emotions, but I wonder if it was my fault I was never checked in with, or if my parents should have checked in just to see. I guess not showing any emotions visibly might have made them assume I was fine, but I feel they should have asked a few times for safe measures.
