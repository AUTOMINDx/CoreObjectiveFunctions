Tattoos in early modern Europe
A bit unsure if this question belongs here or in ask historians. But I think it should be here.

So, tattoos. Today it is a widespread phenomenon world wide to put tattoos on yourself. Some cultures as far as I understand also still use them as a part of said culture rather than the popular form of just covering yourself in artwork that is significant to you as an individual. 

But is there evidence that tattoos where a part of early modern Europe and if so in what context? (1400-1900 A D)

I understand they probably weren't used in the same way as they are today. But did some form of extensive tattooing exist in any of the European cultures? Was is connected in that case to a line of work or anything like that?

And did it in that case come from the pre modern people that lived there?
