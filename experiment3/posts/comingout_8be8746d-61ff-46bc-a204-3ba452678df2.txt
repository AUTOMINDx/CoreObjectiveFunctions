I told my cousin
When i was twelve * I'm 14 now BTW* I told my cousin I was bisexual and he asked me more about it is that he said "at least you're not full gay" I love him but what he said still stuck with me I don't know why because we're practically brothers we grew up together and I still wanna punch that little shit in the teeth but hey maybe he changed I figured out that I'm actually pansexual a while ago so nice okay bye &lt;3
