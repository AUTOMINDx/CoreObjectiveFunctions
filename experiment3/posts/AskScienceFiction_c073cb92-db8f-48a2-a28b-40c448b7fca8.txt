[Pirate fiction] In some works where pirates have a stronghold or city that serves as their "Capital", why do naval superpowers in said works not send their navy to destroy it?
Like there's places like "Bloodeye cove" or "Buccaneer bay" and yet the naval powers in these settings never pull off an Algiers and bombard the place into oblivion. The pirates can't hide their hideouts and lairs forever.

I know that this is a comedic example but in "Pirates an adventure with scientists" where iit's stated that the british navy controls the seven seas and even show a chart as such yet they haven't been able to wipe out that *single* pirate town that they haven't conquered or destroyed. They victorian navy should have the power to obliterate a pirate town like what hapened to Algiers in 1816.

No matter how adventurous and romantic pirate may be, they're all criminals and it's an inevitability that their swashbuckling and yo ho ho-ing will come to an end when the long arm of the law reaches them. That was the same for real life pirates.
