What would you do in this situation ?
My boyfriend and I were in the car today and he brought up having sex in public. I have severe anxiety so that’s out of the question for me. However my boyfriend has a bit of a temper especially when things don’t go his way and he wanted to take me to a park then and there and have sex. I kept opposing and got flustered that he’d bring it up so much. He proceeded to call me ‘lame’ and just get sassy and standoffish with me. We were headed home and my heart sank to my stomach when he took a wrong turn. We pulled over and immediately started telling him i didn’t want to have sex and he told me to ‘chill the fuck out’ and that we were just going for a walk. We ended up behind this building and he started touching me. I didn’t say no but i didn’t stop him. We did end up having sex and immediately after i felt so dirty and gross about myself. I just know that i didn’t want him mad at me because that verbally never goes well. Thinking about it now a few hours later it gives me a wave of anxiety and makes me want to close my eyes and shrink up. I don’t want to talk to him about this situation and how it made me feel because that will just result in an argument I won’t win. I don’t really know what i’m asking for here. I just don’t know what to do.
