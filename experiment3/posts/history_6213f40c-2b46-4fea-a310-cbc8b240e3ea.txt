My march through history at the turn of the first millennium
Hello history fans. I’ve hit a milestone two years in the making and I just have to tell someone. So I thought I’d discuss the time period with fellow history redditors.

Two years ago, I decided to learn human history. All of it, at least in a cursory manner. I began with prehistory. The evolution of man. Through to the agricultural revolution, the rise of civilization, the Bronze and Iron Ages, classical Greece and warring states period China, Rome, Han Dynasty, into the common era, and now, after almost exactly two years, I’ve made it to the year 1000.

In my studies, I’ve gone chronologically through human history. Worldwide history. I go decade by decade around the globe, learning about societies as diverse as ancient Egypt, the maritime Srivijaya empire in Southeast Asia, the Liao Khitan empire of the Asian steppe, the Mayas, Volga Bulgars, Muslim Spain, the Viking age, Holy Roman Empire, and more. 

I’ve recently read about Basil the Bulgar Slayer bringing Rome back to glory, the rise of the Fatimids in Egypt, the beginnings of Capetian France and HRE Germany, Almanzor’s brutal jihads against the northern Christian Spanish kingdoms, the rise of Song Dynasty China in all of its glory, and so much more.

The year 1000 is actually an amazing time period of study. Globalization is kicking off, with the Vikings discovering America, the maritime sea trade really picking up, the trans-Sahara slave trade in full throttle. Population is booming in China and Europe is picking themselves up finally, 500 years after Rome fell. The Turkic people are really on the move, with huge khaganates in Central Asia and the ghaznavids and seljuks coming on the scene. Just a really fascinating time period. 

What are some of your favorite societies around this time? I’m really looking forward to getting into the high Middle Ages. Let’s talk history around the year 1000.
