My boss is restructuring an entire team around me but I'm interviewing elsewhere, should I feel bad?
I've been at this place for like 6 months, I'm not even out of my probation period but I'm really not enjoying it. I've been put with a terrible client and am exhausted already. 

My boss is currently restructuring an entire team of 15 around me and giving me a promotion to lead this team, but I'm currently interviewing elsewhere and it's very likely I'll be offered the role. They will be fucked if I leave. Should I feel bad about this or is it just business and I need to think about myself? I feel like Josh from the Office right now. I really like the people I work with but the situation is just a nightmare.
