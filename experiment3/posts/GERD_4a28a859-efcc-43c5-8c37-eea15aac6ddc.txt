Puking while asleep?
My GERD was acting up this evening and I spit up some while laying flat on my back. After choking on it, I ran into the bathroom and vomited into the sink. I'm lying here terrified of aspiration pneumonia and wondering if anyone else has dealt with this. Did you end up going to the hospital? Did anything happen to you?
