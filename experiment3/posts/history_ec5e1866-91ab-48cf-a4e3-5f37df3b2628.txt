Were barbarians truly disgusted by gladiator fights?
This is something that I remember my history professor saying a few years ago but I haven't actually been able to find anything relating to it. The idea that barbarians, as the Romans called them, bore witness to gladiator fights and found it to be a display of madness, with countless people cheering for the deaths of their own people and wondering why they were considered to be savages. Is there anything to back up something like that?
