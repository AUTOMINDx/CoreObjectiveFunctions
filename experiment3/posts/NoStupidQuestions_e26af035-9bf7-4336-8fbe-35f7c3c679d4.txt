Was this restaurant reasonable for telling me I couldn't sit at a table after seating me and taking my drink order? Was I reasonable just for walking out.
I'm finally graduating I think,



To celebrate I went to the restaurant that shares a building with my apartment complex, kind of semi-fancy Mediterranean place but it doesn't seem to have a dress code 

I don't know if it was about dares code, their website says "casual upscale"

I walk in and ask for seating for one and ask me if I want to be at the bar or at the table I said table if that's available, I was seated and got my drink order, I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt but I figured if there was a dress code, I would have been asked or warned before sitting down.

Male employee comes by and asks if I'd rather sit at the bar looking somewhat put out, I told him I'd rather stay at the table if that's okay but if I'm not allowed to let me know.

He goes off and talks to a manager and comes back and says he's going to move me to the bar, I think him and leave the restaurant.

I'm not going to celebratory mood anymore, so I figure I'll have a celebration meal some other time when I'm not annoyed and someplace where I'm not giving that particular restaurant money

Was I unreasonable for walking out? Were they unreasonable for forcing me to move?

It was a Thursday night most of the place was empty so they weren't preparing for a party
