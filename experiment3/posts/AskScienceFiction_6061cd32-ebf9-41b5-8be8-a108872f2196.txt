[General] Are there any characters who are distressed by fourth wall awareness?
When we think of characters who routinely breal the fourth wall, we usually think of Deadpool or other toonforce characters. Deadpool especially is a corny jokester who doesn't take much seriously.

So is there anyone who gained awareness of being fictional and were very upset about it? Does anyone take the fourth wall seriously?
