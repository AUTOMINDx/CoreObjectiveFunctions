Hey mom, I bought my brother a PS5 and there is nothing you can do about it.
You may have sold the PS3 he bought himself after you kicked him out, and you may have kept him locked out of his original PS account for 2 years with his PS4, but now that we both have nothing to do with you, he is going to enjoy his console stress-free. He will never have to worry about you seizing his own property if he did one thing wrong, he won’t worry about losing access to an account he’d spend years building and purchasing things on, and he will never have to worry about it being sold and never seeing the money that came from it.

I wish you could see his face when he opens it this Christmas, I hope it pains you that you have no leverage, no power and no control over us anymore. At the very least, I hope you seethe when you find out from family that he received one. I hope it pains you when I eventually buy myself one, too. There’s nothing you can do except anger yourself… what a sad existence.
