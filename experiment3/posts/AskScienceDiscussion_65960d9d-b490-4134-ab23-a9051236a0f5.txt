What would happen if a "void" appeared inside the Earth's atmosphere?
Imagine a sphere 100 meters in diameter disappears. Replaced with nothing. No air, no debris, no atoms, no energy...just nothing. Obviously the atmosphere would immediately collapse into this void and fill, but how violent would this action be? Are we talking shock waves and thunder and general mayhem in the near vicinity? Or does the air just move in with minimal noticeable effect?

What would be the effect if it were a denser atmosphere like Venus?
