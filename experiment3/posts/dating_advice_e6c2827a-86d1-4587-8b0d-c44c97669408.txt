Girl I’m dating exclusively always texts me to eat on well and asks how my day went
I like it because it makes me feel special but I’m curious: how do long term couples do this, do you always ask how your SO’s day went every day?

Edit: Thank you so much for everyone who answered! I reciprocated her actions and she likes it! 

Eat on well is eat well, I can't edit the title before I realized the grammar mistake.
