I made my physiologist cry today.
Trigger: SI  

I didnâ€™t do anything purposely or directly to her, but she cried after I brought up my passive suicidal ideation and how she genuinely cares about me and hates how Iâ€™m suffering alone. I wanted nothing to cry alongside her, but was overcome with guilt that sheâ€™s wasting her time, and energy on me because I donâ€™t deserve this. I feel like Iâ€™m just a burden to her, and especially now more than even since she wants to up our sessions to twice weekly. 

This therapy thing is hard. Donâ€™t let anyone tell you otherwise. ðŸ˜ž
