Is there a paradigm shift or discussion going on similar to the ontological turn in anthropology in other disciplines?
I have been reading a lot on the ontological turn and I was just wondering if anthropology was alone in its paradigm shift or are there similar trends in other disciplines, probably social sciences or humanities.
