Are the Andamese connected to the Negritos of the Philipines in any way?
Is there a connection between the various Andamanese groups and the so called Filipino "Negritos"? Or are their so called "similarities" (such as shorter heights, hunter gatherer lifestyles, and darker skin tones) entirely superficial?
