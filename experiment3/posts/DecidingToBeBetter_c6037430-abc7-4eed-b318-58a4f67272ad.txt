What are some habits that have genuinely changed your life for the better?
I’m lacking in that department right now, hence the post, but here’s one that changed my life when I successfully stuck to it in the past - do something that makes you feel in touch with your mind + body for ~15 minutes before bed. For me, this has included keeping mindful skincare routine, doing a short and easy yoga routine, or reading a chapter of a good book.
