Is it normal to not complete everything in your dissertation proposal?
I submitted and defended my research proposal right when covid shut everything down, so the planning of projects and methods was thought through before the world changed. Further, my family had a few medical emergencies I had to help with (including open heart surgery). I’m also a slower worker to begin with so these other things did not help. My original proposal consisted of three overlapping, but distinct, projects. But i’m only done with one and a little halfway through my second project. I am already in my fifth year and my advisor does not want me to delay graduation any further. She wants me to drop my third project all together and modify the second slightly so I can graduate sooner rather than later and graduate in May. 
However, I am worried that this looks bad and makes me seem like a lazy, incompetent grad student. Is it normal to not complete everything in a proposal, even when there is not a world wide pandemic. Overall what I have done, while similar to other research, does look at different fields and expands up knowledge in its domain. I just feel bad and worried that I did not do as much as I originally planned.

Edit to add: I have some presentation experience but no publications. I am working on getting an online portfolio set up. That being said, I have no plans to stay in academia and am looking at jobs in the private/government sector. My skill set, much gained from the research I have completed for my dissertation, is in demand. Im not sure if any of that makes a difference.
