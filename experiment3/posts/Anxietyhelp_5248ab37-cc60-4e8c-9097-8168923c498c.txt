I need to talk to someone
(English is my second language so, sorry if I'm not that good)
I'm in the middle of an anxiety attack I can't stop it, it's harder than other times. I'm supposed to be able to just relax but it seems impossible today. I don't know why I feel like this but I just want to shut my brain right now. It's late, I'm tired but i can't sleep. I'll be very thankful if you could help me, thanks
