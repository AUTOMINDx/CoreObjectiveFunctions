I decided to quit drinking yesterday after a scary incident
Most my friends would probably agree that I'm an alcoholic, I've always binged on alcohol way beyond what those around me do. I don't ever throw up or pass out so I can just keep on throwing back shots well after reaching the blackout point. 

Two days ago, I was at my friend's house drinking. The girl who invited me was the sweetest girl you've ever met and I would never dream of doing anything to wrong her. I got far too drunk (Nearly an entire bottle of jack daniels plus several tequila shots from the bar) and became belligerent. She took me outside to try and calm me down because I was being loud and wouldn't let me back inside, and I apparently pushed her. 

I don't remember it at all but she was scared and crying and my friend had to take me home. She has since blocked me on all social media and none of her friends will talk to me. 

I am disgusted and horrified at myself. I don't even remember doing that but when my friend told me the next day I felt sick to my stomach. I'm never touching alcohol again, this is the last straw. I'm posting this to hold myself accountable. 

They say alcohol brings out your true self, and if that's true, then I never want to be my true self ever again. What a terrible substance, I will not take another sip for the rest of my life.
