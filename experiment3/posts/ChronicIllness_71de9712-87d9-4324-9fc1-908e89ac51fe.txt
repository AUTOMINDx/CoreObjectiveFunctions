So sick of the medical gaslighting
“Oh well, you’re not *that* sick! You’re pretty healthy, actually. You’re not in pain too often.” 

my other favorite from Christmas, “you’re not like, actually immune suppressed.. only a little.”

I was diagnosed with RA this year. I’m on a DMARD. I’m seriously mentally struggling every fucking day, and I’m then getting told I’m “pretty healthy.”
