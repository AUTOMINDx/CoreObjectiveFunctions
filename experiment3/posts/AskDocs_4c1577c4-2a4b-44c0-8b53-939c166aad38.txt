My 1F daughter has suddenly developed a tic where her head jerks every so often, what could it be?
In the past couple of days, my daughter has started twitching her head almost like a tic. I’ve contacted a doctor amd they asked me to put her on ibuprofen for a couple days in case it’s a muscle issue (her left shoulder and neck muscles are more tense than her right).

As the doctors won’t do anything until they see that the ibuprofen isn’t helping, I was hoping for a second opinion here. 

She’s otherwise happy, healthy, she eats, poops, sleeps and plays like normal. However she has this tic every minute or so. Sometimes more fequent, sometimes less. She also doesn’t do this when she’s lying down/sleeping.

Here’s a video to clarify: https://streamable.com/ju6tja

Any ideas?
