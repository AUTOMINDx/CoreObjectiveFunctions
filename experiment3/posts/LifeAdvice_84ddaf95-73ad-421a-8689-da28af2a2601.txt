Am I selfish for wanting to see my cousins open the $400 worth of presents I bought them since their parents couldn’t afford it?
So every year for the past 4-5 years, my uncle and aunt neglect to buy their kids anything for Christmas. They say it’s because they can’t afford it, but they just don’t care to save any money. So everyone else in the family picks up the slack and buys the two girls (11 and 16 now) all their Xmas gifts and put it in their parents names. This year I was the only one who could afford it (barely), and I would like to at lease see them open them. But alas, my uncle and aunt are insisting that they take everything home. I mean, I get it, I wouldn’t mind sending a few home so they could have something to open up Xmas day, but they were coming over Xmas morning anyways, so I thought they were gonna open them with everyone else instead of watching us all open out presents. My other family members are telling me I’m being selfish and that “that’s not the point of sponsoring” and I get that. I guess I’m just a bit disappointed. (And ofc everything is addressed from “mom and dad”)
