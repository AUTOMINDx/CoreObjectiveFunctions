Should I answer my ex’s text concerning my health and being in the hospital?
So, my (ex) boyfriend of two years broke up with me about two weeks ago by claiming he wasn’t ready for a relationship and ai never noticed how bad the relationship was until I updated my therapist and opened up to my friends and they were all shook. My therapist told me to never go back and that I gave him everything I had to give and he was just not emotionally mature. He would gaslight me and make me seem crazy for communicating. From my therapist pov, he says i deserve to be treated kindly. 

Which brings me to the now. I have been hospitalized for three days due to having severe COVID symptoms (THANKFULLY IM OKAY NOW IM A TROOPER) but yesterday, I received a message from him (I deleted his number and blocked him on everything else but I knew it was him since I memorize numbers of those I find myself closest to) and he texted me if i was “good” because he saw I was in the hospital. 

Originally, I told myself I will never speak to him again no matter how much I love him. I wasn’t going to answer. However, is this mean to do? I also don’t want him to worry. 

Does he deserve to know how i’m doing after breaking me? Should I just never answer?
