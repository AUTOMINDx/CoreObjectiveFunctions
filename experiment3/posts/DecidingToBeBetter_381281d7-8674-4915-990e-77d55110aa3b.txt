no identity, no personality
Does anybody else feel like they 'are just there'?

I feel like there is no depth to me. I have no interests anymore, everything feels like a chore. I don't feel like a real person, only a spectator - I am here, but not really. 

I have no personality. I pick up some traits I see in others, or on TV. I feel like I am just a mix of various people I've considered interesting, and I just impersonate and mimic them. I just live and do what others want me to do. I feel like an empty shell. I daydream all the time, and sometimes feel like I am losing touch with reality. Sometimes I can't recall what my face looks like, all I see are parts of it, and it feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable.

I have no idea what is going on with me. I've been growing more and more suicidal each day. I just wish I could feel okay for a moment.
