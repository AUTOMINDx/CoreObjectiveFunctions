For the second Christmas in a row my mom threw a tantrum because she didn’t get her way
Last year I got her a $25 gift card and pjs because I didn’t even plan on buying gifts in the first place because I was saving up for a car but I felt bad and caved. Her response to the gift “that’s it?”.

Today,She has been harassing me all day asking where her gifts are. We had planned to go to our sisters house after dinner to open gifts like we usually do for the past couple of years and she was aware of that. She kept pushing ,demanding her gift now. I finally had enough  and said “ where are our gifts mom?”. She got upset and said “ you kept that up and you wouldn’t be getting anything from me. What I was getting you for Christmas would have been more than what you got me anyways. You can keep your gift”. My feelings are hurt and Im flabbergasted.
