Sharing my personal journey (and hoping some of my tips/tricks work for you!)
Hey!

I see a lot of you guys suffering with this terrible disease on here. Whether you're super informed about meds that are typically prescribed for reflux or not, I'm going to detail everything I've tried in hopes some of what I'm saying sticks, or maybe what worked for me will work for you!

**Tips:**

1. **If a medication or dose is not working for you, TELL YOUR DOCTOR**. For example, if you're on Pantoprazole/Protonix and you feel the drug is not working, your doctor might up your dose (typically, 20mg is a lower dose; 40mg is the highest dose for this drug), or they might switch you to an H2 Blocker, like Famotidine/Pepcid. Or they could put you on a drug like Carafate/Sucalfrate.
2. **If you have titrated up and down on a medication, it might be time to TRY A NEW DRUG**. For example, if you tried Pantoprazole at 20 and 40mg, and you are still experiencing no relief, ask your doctor for a PPI that's not Pantoprazole. There is...

\-Dexilant (30 and 60mg- prescription only))

\-Prilosec (prescription doses are 10/20/40mg)

\-Nexium (20 and 40mg- prescription doses)

\-Aciphex (30 and 60mg- prescription only)

\-Prevacid (15 and 30mg- prescription only)

\-Zegerid/Omeprazole (10/20/40mg- prescription doses)

**And these H2 Blockers:**

\-Famotidine (10/20/40mg- prescription only)

\-Nizatidine (60/90/100/120/180 mL- prescription only)

\-Cimetidine (200/300/400/800mg- prescription doses)

3. **If your doctor is suggesting getting tested done, do them ALL**. Usually diagnostic testing is encouraged/required for getting a surgery referral. Even if you don't go the surgery route, it is still important information for you and your doctor(s). These are the tests I got (and you can ask your doctors about these):

**-Gastric emptying**

**-Upper abdominal ultrasound**

**-Upper endoscopy (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-Barium swallow**

**-Esophageal manometry (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-Bravo (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-24pH test/impedance test (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

4. **Know surgery IS an option, and the surgeries generally have good outcomes. Different surgeries available for acid reflux:**

**-LINX**

**-Stretta**

**-Nissen Fundoplication**

**-TIF**

**-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass**

5. If your GERD is correlated with your anxiety, these meds. helped me and might help you (w/ anxiety and acid reflux):

**-SSRI's (Lexapro, Zoloft, Celexa, Prozac, Paxil).**

**-SNRI's (Effexor, Fetzima, Cymbalta, Pristiq)**

**Also, therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can help. It might be helpful to see a therapist that specializes in ANXIETY and/or CHRONIC ILLNESS.**

6. **Avoid high-fat, spicy, deep fried foods. Stick to alkaline foods. These foods/drinks helped with my symptoms:**

\-Fruits such as apples, bananas, beets, apricots

\-Really any vegetable

\-Oatmeal/oats

\-Yogurts (try to stick to low-fat; probiotic yogurt is also an EXCELLENT choice)

\-Water 

\-Chamomile Tea

7. Avoid caffeine/nicotine/alcohol-- these are drugs that **can relax the LES.**

Let me know if these tips were helpful! Hope you guys get relief soon! It's going on a year since I had the LINX with hiatal hernia repair and I'm currently on 50mg Zoloft (it's been 2 months so far). So far, anxiety/depression is manageable and I am reflux-free :) I want you guys to have a happy ending, too!
