What are your mornings like?
I found out recently that my partner wakes up with a completely clear head, and has the space to calmly wake up and think about his day 

My mornings are my brain going 100mph as soon as I open my eyes, thinking about every single thing going on in my life and making up some other things just to add to the whirlpool of thoughts!
