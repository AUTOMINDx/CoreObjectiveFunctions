My n mom doesn't respect physical or sexual boundaries
She is insistent on combing my hair every morning and I'm 23. If I don't let her do it she loses her shit. I have a panic attack in the bathroom every morning over it. 

She has touched my boobs. She has said that if I don't like her touching me she didn't know how I was going to have sex with my boyfriend. She has put her hands down my pants (to check if they were too big... As I was an adult). And she smacked my ass too many times to count. 

Her narcissism is based on looks. I wouldn't say I'm bad looking but it's not too common that I'm one of those people that's 'expressive' or invested. She also comments on how I'm not trying to look good, that I'm a attractive person and so should try harder, or sometimes that I could look good 'if I wanted to' and also points out flaws in my physical appearance. 

This also culminates into commenting when I'm losing weight and then feeding me nothing but fast food! Or commenting that I have 'sexy' body parts. 

She also is so insistent in me parting my hair that she will literally make me push her off of me if I don't. 

She constantly comments on how I smell. 1. Nobody else does 2. If I do I'm just sweating from anxiety. 

Somebody please help me I'm seriously tired of freaking out every morning like there's a wolf in my house

Edit: for confusion my nmom is my grandmother because I was raised by her so for the sub I usually say nmom because she raised me

On that note my edad is my grandpa and biodad is biological dad. I was raised by my grandparents because my parents were addicts. 

Thanks for understanding guys

I'm so relieved to be believed and all the incoming support! I've been struggling a lot with other life circumstances and it's really giving me a lot of hope in moving forward and in my own strength. I'm very grateful for all the kind words and advice and that there's a way out. I have been taking note
