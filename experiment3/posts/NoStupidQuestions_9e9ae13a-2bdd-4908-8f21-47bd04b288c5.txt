Do you think Planet Fitness would care if i got a membership and only came in to use the shower?
Over the past year my arthritis has got so bad that i can't stand or walk anymore making it impossible to get in the shower with how my bathrooms are built. The washcloth method just isn't the same a hot shower. Planet Fitness right next to me has a handicap shower stall i might be able to use. Do you think they'd care?

Edit: Thanks guys, I could just call them but I'm feeling super self conscious and embarrassed about all this for some reason. Thanks for the responses.
