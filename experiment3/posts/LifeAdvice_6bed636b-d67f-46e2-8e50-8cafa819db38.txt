I don’t want to exist anymore.
I genuinely am so stressed and uninspired that I just don’t want to exist anymore. I’m to big of a pussy to actually commit suicide. I think the only reason I’m still here is I have two young kids and another on the way. Otherwise I would not be here anymore. They are young and have a great mother and step dad though and feel like through a couple years ago I would only be a distant memory.
