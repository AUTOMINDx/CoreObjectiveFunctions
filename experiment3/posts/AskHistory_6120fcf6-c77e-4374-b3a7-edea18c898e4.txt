Weimar Republic
Does anyone know of a good book about Weimar Germany that chronicles how life and culture changed in the years leading up to the holocaust? Im looking to find the answer to the question:" How do people go from peaceful coexistence to genocide?" so i figured leaning about the culture back then would be a good place to start.
