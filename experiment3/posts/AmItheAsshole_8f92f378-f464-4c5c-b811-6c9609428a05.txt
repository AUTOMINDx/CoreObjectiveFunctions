AITA for getting mad at my wife after she tried to add to my daughter’s workload?
My (47M) daughter (16F) has schizophrenia. Due to this she has to take medication that blocks her dopamine receptors, which makes her much more tired. I have 3 other stepchildren with my current wife (37F) and they unarguably do more work than my daughter chore-wise. I expect my daughter to clean her room, maintain good grades, and that is it. I know her medication makes her very tired throughout the day and school already burns through her motivation to do anything. 

My wife doesn’t like the idea that her kids have to do more chores around the house compared to my kid. I told her that it’s because my daughter’s medication makes her more tired, and if I were to take her off of it she would become a danger to herself and possibly the rest of us. While I was away for a business trip for a week, I saw my daughter scrubbing the kitchen floor with my wife standing right by the entrance. I got mad and asked her what the deal was. She said she was teaching my daughter to “not be a slob”. I said she doesn’t get to dictate what her chores are, like I don’t dictate what my stepchildren’s chores are. AITA for getting mad at my wife over this?

Dear voters: Please do not discuss what I should and should not do with my daughters medication unless you are aware of how schizophrenia is treated. Thank you.

ETA: Stepkids are aware of her condition and they know if my daughter could do more than I would make her do more. I set aside time to spend with all of the children individually and then ways to hang out as a family. Stepdaughter (14F) has a bond with my daughter that is very similar to how real siblings are. There’s not much resentment as far as I can see. I’m going to talk to my wife about how things are when I get the chance. I’ll update you guys about it, and I hope things go well.
