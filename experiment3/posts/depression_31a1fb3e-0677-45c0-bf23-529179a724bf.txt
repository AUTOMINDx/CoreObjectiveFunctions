I have a beautiful girlfriend
I have a beautiful girlfriend who tells me she loves me everyday.

I have beautiful friends who care for me when I can’t care for myself.

I have a beautiful mother whom i love and who’s always there for me.

I’ve gotten into med school and my life’s on track.

I’m on antidepressants and antipsychotics which get me through the day.

So why
Am I still
So empty

…………………..

Get me out of here
