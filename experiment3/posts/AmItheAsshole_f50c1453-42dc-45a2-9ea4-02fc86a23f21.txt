AITA for not continuing paying my parents’ expenses after I got married?
When I was 20 yo I had a son and became a single mom, (the dad didn’t want to be part of my son’s life) my parents offered me to stay at their house and my mom could help with the baby. I thought it was a blessing since I now am responsible for my baby. I was extremely grateful. I worked harder than ever, I paid 1/2 their rent, $200 for bills at first. After months of this arrangement my dad lost his job, my mom didn’t work. I had a good job that was paying me well, so I took on all the expenses of the house while my dad found a new job. I’m talking full rent, groceries, utilities, tv, cellphones, gas, car insurance, even spending money for them. A year after “no luck finding a job” my parents tell me my dad will no longer be looking for a job since he is now old and tired. That I have been doing great at work and they see how I can support them, so we should now just keep doing this. At the moment I was grateful for all their help with my son that I didn’t disagree. This went on for 3 years, until one day I met this guy who is now my husband. After getting married my parents were expecting him moving in with us and we will continue this, but sadly I didn’t want to. My husband and I talked and we agreed to get our own place, start our own family, our own life and give my son a chance of a family. When we told my parents they got super angry saying they have no way to support themselves and I already had agreed to support them. Basically I was their retirement! I didn’t see a problem moving out since my parents are not THAT old, they are both 52. They agreed to “let” me move out but I had to leave my son, so I could still be supporting them. To which my husband replied “No Way! He is my stepson who I see as my own son, he is not staying here” . My parents replied “ok, they both can move out but she still has to pay for our expenses” I told them we could help them for couple months but sadly I couldn’t keep paying for ALL their expenses. AITA?
