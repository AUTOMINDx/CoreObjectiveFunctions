My therapist texted me asking to meet or coffee
Im 25f and feeling REALLY uncomfortable right now.   My trauma therapist (46m) texted saying he will be near my area tomorrow and asked what I thought about meeting for coffee or something during my scheduled time.   This feels wrong too me, especially since I have a trauma history with men my dads age and Ive never met this guy in person only video.
