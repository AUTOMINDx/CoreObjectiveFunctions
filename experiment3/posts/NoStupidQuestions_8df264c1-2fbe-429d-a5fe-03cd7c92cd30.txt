Left at home announced?
I woke up today without my mother or brother being home. I send them both a message, unanswered. It's nearly 5pm and I am considering calling the police. I've asked some friends of theirs and they haven't answered. I know I shouldn't worry but I don't know what to do.

Edit: aunt picked me up. She has no idea where or why they went. She assured me that it's probably fine.

Edit 2: my aunt did call hospitals and the police in the area. Nothing. I'm going to try and sleep just to not be so stressed. Will update again tomorrow

Edit 3: sorry for the long repsonse on this update. I slept longer than I intended. I haven't been sleeping great the past few days. I barely got any quality sleep. My mom and brother are okay. Here's the story, my brothers best friend who lives about 4 hours away told my brother that he is contemplating suicide at around 3am. He cannot drive since he doesn't have his license, he begged my mom to drive him and she saw how important it was and agreed and left in a rush. They got lost on the way and their phones died. Eventually they got to where they needed to be, but it was already too late unfortunately. My brothers best friend killed himself. My mom said she was too tired and too sad to drive so they decided to rather drive tomorrow. (I don't see why they couldn't tell me though) They said they didn't have a charger, but they know my number. It's sad about my brothers friend but I don't think I should've been unaware about it.
