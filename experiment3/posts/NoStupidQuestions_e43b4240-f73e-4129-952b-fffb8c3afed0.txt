Is it normal to not wash your feet while in the shower?
My wife thinks it’s gross that I don’t bend down to wash my feet when I shower. Now I’m kind of embarrassed to ask friends if they do. I always figured the soap from washing your body basically cleans them naturally.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards and responses guys, but I guess my feet are officially horribly foul.

EDIT 2: Dang this blew up, made it to the front page for having nasty feet. Btw, my feet don’t stink, and they’re not infected. Please don’t message me about it, I get it now…
