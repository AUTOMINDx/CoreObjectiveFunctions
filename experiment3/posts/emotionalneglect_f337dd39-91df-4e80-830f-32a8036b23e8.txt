Tried to open up about my past to a friend and they proceeded to tell me that all of it is in the past, I should be grateful for everything my mom has done for me
Don’t get me wrong I’m very very grateful for everything my parents have provided me with but I just wanted to talk about my past without someone invalidating my feelings.
Edit: or maybe I am overreacting I don’t know at this point
