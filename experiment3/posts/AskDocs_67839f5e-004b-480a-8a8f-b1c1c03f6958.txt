I just turned 32 years old and weigh 400 pounds. If I turn things around, what are my long term prospects?
Hi all,

Last week was my 32nd birthday. I currently weigh 400 pounds. My only diagnosed physical health problem is sleep apnea, which I have a CPAP machine for.

I got blood tests about a month back, and they were surprisingly alright. Slightly high cholesterol, AST/ALT, and glucose, but nothing requiring medication.

I have a 1 year old son and am starting to realize just how much I've ruined this first segment of my life. I'm working on trying to fix everything. Lose the weight, eat healthy, etc. I am working with doctors and therapists and getting all the help I can. I also have struggled with alcoholism but that's being kicked as well.

So.... my question... I just turned 32 and am 400 pounds. Let's say, when I turn 33, I'm down to 200 pounds (done safely of course). Or even I turn 34 and I'm down to like 180. What's my shot at living a long life? Can I make it to 60 or 70? Can I meet my grandkids? Or have I already ruined those prospects, the future be damned. Basically.... how much does the past I have had mess up my potential future?

I'd very much like brutally honest answers. No matter what, I am going to work towards being so much healthier. Of course, everything is a guess. But just wondering if anyone has knowledge or experience on how much a human body can "bounce back".

Thanks so much
