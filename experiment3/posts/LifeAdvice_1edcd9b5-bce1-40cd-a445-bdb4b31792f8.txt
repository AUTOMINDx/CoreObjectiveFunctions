Wondering if I should have sex
So there’s this girl (19f) I’ve (19m) been hanging out with a lot recently. We’ve been watching movies and cuddling a lot. We’re also both virgins and I want to ask her if she’d like to swap v-cards with me. The troubling part is that she’s made it very clear that she doesn’t want to date me, but she’s also told me that she’d have sex with me. 
Another problem is that there’s this other girl at my college who I plan on dating, but we aren’t a thing yet. 
What should I do?
