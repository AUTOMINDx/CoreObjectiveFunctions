19 female, I’m home alone yet can’t stand up as I keep falling over
19f, 5ft10, 121 pounds. Feels like my body and eyes are insanely drunk but not my brain

Just had dinner and stood up from the sofa to do the dishes only to feel instantly dizzy, lost balance and fell right on my side. I stood back up and realised I can’t keep my eyes still- it feels like when you’re wine drunk and can’t focus on an object because you can feel the earth moving

Went upstairs to go to the toilet carefully yet lost my balance again and basically wacked myself against the radiator 

I don’t feel ill or anything- I can focus on short vision objects but everything in my long vision is wobbly. Just insanely dizzy

Also I am on my period and it is very heavy

Any help?

Edit: thanks for all the responses. I managed to survive the past hours by focusing on short range objects because that seems to lessen the dizziness. I’m not home alone anymore thankfully, I’ll be booking a doctors app tmr! Thanks for comforting me in the meantime :)
