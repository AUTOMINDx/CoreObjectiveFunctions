Is it weird to go to office Christmas party alone, without my husband?
My husband can’t go with me to my office Christmas party because he has to work that night. I said I would find a sitter for our son and go alone. He said that’s weird to go alone, and asked why do I want to go so badly? Is it weird? He told me that my coworkers are not my friends, and they never will be my friends. He told me that I usually hate them anyways, why do I want to go hang out with them at my bosses stuffy party? Is he right? Should I blow it off, or go alone? 
PS I don’t have the best relationships with my coworkers but I’m trying to improve that. Plus I always have fun at parties
