My Story: And How to Successful Beat Agoraphobia
***Long post ahead, but hopefully those of you who are fighting find it valuable in your journey.***

For starters, I suffered from Agoraphobia for about two or three years. 

Initially it began as social anxiety and the fear of doing "big" things like leaving the state or going on longer road trips, Eventually after losing a job that I loved, this anxiety turned into full blown agoraphobia. I couldn't go on a walk around the block without it turning into a panic attack. As time passed, the agoraphobia got more and more encompassing until I even began to feel "strange" inside my own bedroom. I felt slightly dizzy, almost drugged and as if things were slightly less real than they were before. 

I even began to feel anxious when people were over. I worried a lot about what people thought about me. The more time I spent inside the worse I felt when venturing out. I've said before, doing things like going to the corner-store brought on such intense feelings of fear and panic that it felt like I would warp into another dimension. 

Realizing that this condition wasn't going to go away on it's own, I started trying to fight my way out of it. I read the book "dare" and a few of the books by Claire Weekes, and I tried my best to fight my way out of it. I remember driving to a hardware store a few blocks away and just trying to sit in the parking lot as long as I could or until my heartrate went down. I knew I was stepping in the right direction, but still, beneath all of my hope was an intense well of shame about what I had become. 

When setbacks occurred, my days would be ruined. I would have such negative thoughts as "Other people are living great lives, and you can't even go to the store without cracking up." 

I would picture myself doing things like driving on the highway or going on trips again and just not be able to imagine them happening. It truly seemed impossible.

Looking back at the person I was to the person I am now, it really does seem hard to believe, but I want everyone reading this now to know that it is entirely possible to beat agoraphobia and it is not as difficult as you think (but it will take more work than you think).

# So how did I cure my Agoraphobia?

\*The following tools and tips are going to be written in the order that I believe they should be addressed, not necessarily in the order that I found out about them.\*

# A. You must cure all of your addictions first. 

Addiction will interfere with your ability to learn and unlearn (which is crucial for curing agoraphobia). Addictions can include drugs and alcohol, but even things like pornography, Internet addiction, gambling, cell-phone addiction can cause enough chaos in your reward system that it will make your progress nearly impossible.

Addiction can also cause intense anxiety when you are away from said addiction. For example, if you have agoraphobia and are addicted to the internet, the added anxiety of withdrawing from the internet will compound your problems when you are out in public. 

There are plenty of good books and tips for how to sober up from these addictions online (see someone about it if you can) and you can even join sites like InTheRooms that offers free addiction meetings (You don't have to talk or turn your camera on during these meetings you can just watch).

You will experience more anxiety and negative emotion initially, but they will balance out and leave you in a better place to make progress with agoraphobia. 

# B. You must address your shame. 

This isn't talked about much in the literature of agoraphobia (which I believe is one of the reasons why many people don't heal completely) but shame is a huge component. I know it was for me. 

A quick read through some of the posts on this subreddit offers some insight into the shameful thoughts of the agoraphobic. You make read or think things such as *"I'll never get better." "I'm a horrible parent/spouse." "I can't even do x" "My life is terrible compared to xyz" "What will people think?" "I know theyre going to talk about me or laugh at me."*

Thoughts like these sabotage your progress. Hell, they sabotage your motivation to even begin to attempt progressing. 

There are many ways to address shame, but the one that worked the best for me (and the one I would recommend to others) is the book called:  **Freedom from Your Inner Critic: A Self-Therapy Approach by Jay Earley.** 

This book offers a step-by-step program to connect with your inner-critic and listen to what it has to say, and form a new relationship with it that is free from abuse and ridicule. There is a workbook version of the book that I have not read but I'm sure it is helpful as well. 

Why is this so important? Odds are there is a part of you that has turned against yourself. You're probably highly critical and ashamed of certain aspects of yourself. Imagine if instead of a voice that was criticizing you all day, you had a voice that was on your side, that understood that you are wounded and down, but you are not out. What if this voice helped you along your journey? That is what is possible if you do the work in this book. 

# C. Reuniting with your more Courageous self. 

You can learn a lot about this style of therapy and thinking by just searching "Internal Family Systems Therapy". There are plenty of good books and audiobooks on the topic, but there is one particular audio that I believe is crucial for agoraphobia, particularly once you begin to do exposure therapy.

[https://insighttimer.com/drrichardschwartz/guided-meditations/ifs-courage](https://insighttimer.com/drrichardschwartz/guided-meditations/ifs-courage)

This is a 10-minute audio by Dr. Richard Schwarz  that helps you tap into courage.  I wouldn't go as far as saying that agoraphobia is a disorder of cowardice, but I strongly believe the more courage you have the easier everything else becomes and the sooner your mind and body adapt to the "new you". 

I used this audio every morning and before any planned or unplanned exposure. 

# D. The Main Program (includes cbt and exposure therapy)

Have you ever thought, "Gosh, If only I could be helped by one of the best agoraphobia researcher and Doctors alive today." 

Well in a way you can because there is a book called "Mastery of Your Anxiety and Panic: Workbook (Treatments That Work)" Written by Doctors Michelle Craske and David Barlowe, two of the top experts on the subject of panic and agoraphobia. 

The book is a 12-week program that is similar if not identical to the type of program you would be doing if you went to an expert on agoraphobia. 

This book is a lifesaver and really the meat of my recommendations. Without this book I would probably still be agoraphobic to an extent. 

# E. Some tips on exposure. (Note exposure doesn't happen until about week 5 of the program)

1. Read the book "DARE" and commit the steps to memory. (DEFUSE, ALLOW, Run Towards, ENGAGE.....I wrote these steps on the inside of my fingers with marker at first.)
2. I recommend listening to this if you are feeling panicky [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jbmqQp7YFQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jbmqQp7YFQ)
3. Start small. Smaller than you think. Walking around the block is great, but if there's a room in your house that you're not comfortable in, you can spend some time in there first. Does sweeping your basement make you feel weird? Sweep it until it bores you. 
4. Wear a heartrate monitor for the opposite reason of what you're used to. How high can you get your heart rate? (More on this later.)
5. Try not to distract yourself. If you distract yourself, use less distractions as the weeks go on. Welcome the anxiety.
6. Practice engaging when necessary. (I.e. concentrating hard on external things) and also practice disengaging (i.e. letting yourself drift towards relaxing and daydreaming )
7. Remember your fear should decrease week to week, maybe even month to month, NOT day to day. Some days will feel worse than others, and it doesn't always make sense. That's okay.
8. Build up your stamina slowly. I'm aware that flooding (long intense sessions of exposure therapy) works but the odds that you will be doing flooding by yourself consistently is close to zero percent. Going on short walks and short walks will tire your mind and body out at first. It is important to rest and recover and grow your stamina over time. Deep sleep is a must. 
9. As you get better, do multiple scary things at once, experiment with trying to "psyche" yourself out. There are new studies (youtube Michelle Craske) and agoraphobia treatment lasting much longer when patients do multiple scary things at once. I.e. going to a store at night while listening to scary music and talking to a stranger. It is tough but as you progress you will be able to do things like this and it will benefit you.
10. Be prepared for weird things to happen during your early exposure sessions. This is something that I cannot prove and it does not make sense, but when I started doing exposure sessions, people would honk their horn, cars would swerve in front of me, random encounters would happen, etc. Also, if you read some of the posts about exposures here you will notice strange things happening sometimes.  Can I prove that this is a thing? Absolutely not. Is it probably just the statistical variance of life? Sure. Whether its just random events or if it's the universe making sure you're serious about getting over your agoraphobia, be prepared for things to be different than you expect at first. You can handle it. 

# F. Unlocking Your Body.

If you have been housebound (or even if you have spent considerably more time in bed or on the couch than your normal person) then your muscle-mass is less, your balance is worse, your cardio is bad, and even your eyesight is probably bad. I experienced all of these issues (though I didn't know it at the time) and getting back in shape was a pain. 

The good news is it is your choice how to address this problem. Some people like yoga, dance, walking,...I used BeachBody on demand at first and a few stretching routines I found on youtube. 

I highly recommend getting a heart rate monitor (A chest strap, watch, or fitbit is fine) and really training yourself to be used to having a higher heart rate. Over time, having a high heart rate will be second nature and will no longer be a trigger for you. 

If you are similar to how I was, not only are you out of shape but you have difficulty even feeling like you're "IN" your own body. "Body scan meditations" really solve this problem and also give the added benefit of deeper relaxation and sleep. Here is a short one you can try out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANZfVnjCmXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANZfVnjCmXk)

Free resources I recommend: 

[Gymra.com](https://Gymra.com) (Has a tv app too)

[Doyogawithme.com](https://Doyogawithme.com) 

The important things to remember is that something is better than nothing. I half-assed my beginning workouts and did them in normal clothes with very light weight. Over time you will improve. I go to a gym 6-days a week now. 

I also recommend any yoga that stretches your neck (yoga in general is good for anxiety) as well as establishing a simple daily stretching routine. 

Foam rolling and self massage works wonders too. If you can afford it, a massage gun or neck massager is great for relieving those tight areas. 

# G. Moving Forward and other resources.

After recovering from agoraphobia you will still undoubtedly have anxiety. I recommend following up the program with **Mastery of Your Anxiety and Worry: Workbook** by the same authors. 

If you have depression, the company that made the two workbooks I recommended has a few books for treating depression. I recommend "**Self systems therapy for Depression**" but I have heard good things about the others.

There is a book called "**The Upward Spiral"** and "The Upward Spiral Workbook" by Alex Korb that is great for balancing your brain chemistry naturally (also great for preventing relapse). 

If you are a "hard case" and your agoraphobia isn't decreasing as much as you would like, check out the book "**When Panic Attacks**" by David Burns, particularly about "Hidden emotions" and "The hidden emotion technique." 

Another helpful program is "**Unlearn Your Anxiety**" by Howard Schubiner which uses the mind-body-syndrome approach, particularly repressed rage as the cause of anxiety. 

If you have a history of trauma, I recommend the book "**The Body Keeps the Score**" by Bessell Van Der Kolk. I have taken many things from this book (particularly journaling and yoga). 

Lastly, if you want a deep dive into anxiety, panic, and agoraphobia, check out the book "**Anxious**" by Joseph LeDoux. It breaks down what exactly happens when you experience anxiety.
