my psychiatrist once called me "manipulative" bc i felt emotional during a session and started crying
back to the end of 2019, my father had died and i was forced to live with relatives (even being almost 24 years old). I had two cats, and my cousin (who hates pets) made me unwillingly to find someone to adopt them. a friend of mine kept them until i was able to live on.my own, and i lied to my cousin, telling her he was  keeping them permanently. this cousin were very intrusive in my life, accompanying me to medical appointments, including the psychiatrist, and once i was talking to him (she was by my side) and i told i felt bad and was missing my kitties, then i got very emotional and started crying. he told me to stop acting so manipulative and said i use my crying to get what i want. i felt so outraged and misunderstood by everyone plus the controlling attitude of my relatives that in the beginning of 2020 i packed my stuff and left to live with my ex girlfriend without saying a word, cause i was done about being threatened and controled and all their bullshit, and bc i also felt betrayed by my psychiatrist, the only person who could help me to go through it.
