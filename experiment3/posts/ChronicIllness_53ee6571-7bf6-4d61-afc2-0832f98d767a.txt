Is anyone else permanently disabled for a very stupid reason?
I accidentally ingested a metal nail that was in my food and then I got an MRI for something that was unrelated. Yes I know it sounds like a seinfeld episode. I have permanent cardiac and aorta issues now. 

Anyone else have a really stupid injury?
