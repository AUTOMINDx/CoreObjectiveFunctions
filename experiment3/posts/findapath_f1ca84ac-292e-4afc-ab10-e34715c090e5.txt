Late 30s, small kids, little sleep, pressure to succeed but unhappy in career. Feeling stuck, any help?
Apologies from the start: I am moaning on a high level and I really should not, compared to what others are going through…
I am in a old economy big company, decent pay, 15 min commute but WFH as I want… one could say the dream. Reality is that I hate the industry (food and consumer goods) and they actually still treat me as a support / tech helper and excluding me from strategic decisions.

I am trying to find a better fit but after 50-80 applications I only either get entry level pay or rejection letters. 

I feel like I passed the age to easily live with little money or get a cool job and I now have to suffer each day until retirement as I have obligations and need to be a successful father:(… 
Anyone can shed some light how to manage a late 30s life while not yet found the career I am trying to start?!
