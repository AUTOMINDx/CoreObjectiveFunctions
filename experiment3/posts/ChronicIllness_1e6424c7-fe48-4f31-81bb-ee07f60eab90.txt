Tv and movies with bad representation
Hey y’all! I’m a chronically I’ll research student who is doing a project on improving disability portrayal in the media. For this, I’m to watch a number of tv shows and movies and make notes on why they are wrong. If y’all have any that you feel fit in this category, I’d appreciate it if you’d let me know. No pressure though, just wanted to see what others have seen. Thanks!
