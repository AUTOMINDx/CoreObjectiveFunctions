Is there a branch of theism where one chooses to believe in God based on the emotional effects despite an intellectual understanding that the belief is probably not objectively true?
I was speaking with a friend who has what I find to be an unusual and fascinating take on her belief in God.  She fully concedes that she has no rational or evidentiary basis for her belief.  She goes even further to say that God probably doesn't exist by any objective measure.  Nevertheless, she fully believes in God based on the emotional comfort she derives from that belief.    She describes it as emotionally willing herself into her belief.

I've never heard anyone describe their brand of theism quite this way.   And it would seem to lend credence to what many think is the flaw in Pascal's Wager -  the idea that one can choose to believe something they don't otherwise believe.   So, I'm wondering if this is a subject that has been addressed by philosophers, and perhaps I could read more about?
