Where to get help?
I apologize if this is already on this sub, I’ve looked around and haven’t been able to find anything specific.  I have no idea where to even start to get help. (Seriously not a clue where to start)

I’m fairly certain I have an anxiety disorder. It has significantly affected my personal life and for a while I’ve been able to keep it from affecting my work life, but now it is definitely affecting my work life.  I’ve tried to get help from an online platform, but I work between 40 - 80 hours a week and was unable to get a counselor to talk to during that time. Ended up wasting a ton of money for skipped appointments due to my work life.   To complicate it further. I travel around the US for work and am rarely in one spot for too long. If anyone has any advice or insight on this it would be greatly appreciated, and I’ll try my best to answer any questions. Thanks!
