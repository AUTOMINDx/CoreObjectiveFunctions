Nodes moving into Taurus/Scorpio will likely be a revisiting of themes from 2012 to 2013
I’ve looked into this transit it’s yet another indicator so whatever was going on in your life in those years well it will probably come back in some form for me this will be interesting but I will say that period of my life was certainly an as good as it gets kinda period that wasn’t used to it’s fullest capacity it also helped in the development of my current spiritual beliefs too and also the biggest themes during that time were expansion ,how you wanted to appear to the world also relationships and romance was big stuff and emotional intimacy seems fitting for those themes to come back around after living through an ongoing global pandemic 


It was largely a positive time of growth and expansion and development for me it was definitely the golden era of my adolescence years but the point is though you will likely be revisiting stuff from those years
