There were no revolutionaries before the Bastille fell during the French revolution.
Keith Baker states that the notion of revolution as a fact, gave way to the conceptualisation of revolutions as an ongoing act. His entire idea is based on the fact that all revolutions follow a script from one another, however each revolution is still unique in its own way, due to culture, the political and economic sphere, etc... Therefore, with this transformation “revolution” assumes its modern political meaning and the French revolution became the script upon which subsequent revolutionaries improvised. 
I find this to be a quite interesting statement, regardless where i agree with it or not. What is your opinion?
