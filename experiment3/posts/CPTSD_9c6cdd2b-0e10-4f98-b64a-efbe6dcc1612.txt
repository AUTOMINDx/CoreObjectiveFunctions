"Nobody will love you until you love yourself" is a misleading statement.
That sentence always made me angry. It came off as extremely damaging: the last thing a person who hates themselves needs to hear, is that they're also unlovable.

It also was factually untrue - I know of at least one person who genuinely loves me, and loved me even when I hated myself with great enthusiasm. Except, I didn't recognize that love at the time for what it was, and kept pushing them away.

I recently met a kid who reminds me a lot of myself when I was his age. He was in the same situation as I was: neglecting himself to a dangerous degree for the sake of other people's happiness. Except, most of what he got for it was abuse. He openly admitted he would generally fall for anyone who paid him the tiniest amount of attention, regardless of how awful they were to him otherwise, or how little respect they had for him.

That conversation was all sorts of infuriating, sad, and sweet, but it also made me think about that statement again \[to my great annoyance, since I hate it\] - and I realized that it's pointing at something that is true, however, the wording is off:

**It's not that nobody will love you if you don't love yourself.** It's that hating yourself will make it impossible to recognize love when it is given, and to tell it apart from other things that aren't that.
