Imagine having that one person
Just that one person who you can talk to when you wake up. Or you can tell them when you’re happy, sad, angry, anxious… just anything. Any small or big thing that happens during your day and you can tell them about it… and they actually care and want to know too. They want to know how you’re feeling or what happened in your day or just anything because they like you so much… it’s the small things that I seem to want the most but I know it’ll never happen
