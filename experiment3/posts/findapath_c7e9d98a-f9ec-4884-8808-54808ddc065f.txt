I am losing it. EVERY field is "oversaturated" according to Reddit.
Go to every sub related to the particular career. r/LawSchool r/DataScience r/medicine r/programming r/FinancialCareers

Mostly the response I receive is "The demand is weak", "Don't do it. The field is oversaturated"

Then what the hell do I choose? I cannot afford to change my majors anymore. This is too much. I might have to quit Reddit
