ways to make money recommendations
im 18 almost 19 and i haven’t ever had a job  since i developed agoraphobia at such a young age, at 14-15. im recovering and it’s getting easier but i still am partially dependent on my parents being with me out in public, so being left at a job w mo vehicle would be a nono for me rn. i wanna make my own money to kinda pay my role since i’m still living with my parents. being able to have money for groceries, clothes, makeup, books etc i want would just feel so much better coming from my own pocket. any recommendations? possibly from home work but if y’all have other ideas/ personal experiences just lmk
