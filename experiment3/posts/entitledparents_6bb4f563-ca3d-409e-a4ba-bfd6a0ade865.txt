Entitled mother thinks that men can't wear pink
I am a long time lurker but a first time poster this is not my story but some thing I witnessed


This happened a few years ago so my memory isn't the best

Now onto the story,
Me and family was going to a restuarant and we sat down at a table and sitting next to us was two men one of them was wearing a pink hoodie and after a while I noticed a woman(EM) and her daughter the EM was staring at the guy wearing the pink hoodie and after a while she came to there table and said 

EM:um excuse you can't wear pink you are a man

The guy: excuse me ma'am i can wear whatever I want. 

EM: no you can't you are a man (said slowly like the guy didn't get it) you can't wear pink you are setting a bad example for kids

Now the manager(m) enters

M: what's supposed to be the problem here

The guy: um this woman (he got cut off by the EM )

EM: this man is setting a bad example for my kids kick him out off the restaurant

M: ma'am please calm down , (he asks the guy) sir what's the problem here 
 
The guy:sir this woman just came out of nowhere and started yelling at me

EM: oh that's bs 

M: ma'am how is this man setting a bad example

EM: he's wearing pink

The guy: well it's my joice what I wear

EM: oh you shut up

M: maam I am gonna need you to leave 

EM: me why you should kick him out

(The security had showed up and they took and she was screaming while being dragged out)
 
The manager gave them a discount


And her kid was just quite and embarrassed and just followed her while EM was dragged out

So I guess it was a nice ending
