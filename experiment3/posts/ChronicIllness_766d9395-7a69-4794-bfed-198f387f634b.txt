First part of colonoscopy/endoscopy isn't going well
I knew it was going to suck but I didn't anticipate throwing up as a violently pee out my butt! I knew a risk was there since half of whatever is wrong with me is throwing up and just not stopping. I'm in the spare bed wishing my wife could cuddle without the chance of me messing on her. I put on Shadowhunters, my comfort show, and I'm trying to relax a bit but I can't stop shivering between all the bathroom time and not having my iron supplement for 7 days. I just hope I finally get answers and that my mom won't do anything toxic since she has to take me instead of my wife

Quick update: I did take my nausea meds and so far it's stayed down so YAY!
