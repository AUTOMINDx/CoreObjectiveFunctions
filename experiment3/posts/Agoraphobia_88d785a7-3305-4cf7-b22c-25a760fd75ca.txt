How am I supposed to live??
I'm in my early 20s and I live with my parents. Usually, I would be in school, but I have been hospitalized for suicidal ideation multiple times in the past three months so I had to take the semester off. I'm in therapy and I have a psychiatrist. 

Thinking about going back to school makes me want to throw up even though it's online. I just don't feel like  I'm ever going to be able to get a job so what's the point in wasting money on school? I haven't gotten much better in the past two years since I've been dealing with agoraphobia. I can't go to the store and haven't in about a month now. I'm just...really struggling. I have no motivation for anything. I don't want to go back to school and I can't get a job because I literally can't be out of my house for longer than an hour without breaking down. 

What am I supposed to do??
