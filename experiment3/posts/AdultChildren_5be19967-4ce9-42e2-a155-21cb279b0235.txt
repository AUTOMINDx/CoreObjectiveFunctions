Saw a photo of my mum today and I am genuinely shaken
We are VLC but this year her liver disease has progressed and she has had multiple hospital admissions.  My dad sent my sister a photo telling her that he is not visiting her for Christmas as he cannot leave my mum in case she dies while he is out.
The photo is haunting. I feel sick and sad.
