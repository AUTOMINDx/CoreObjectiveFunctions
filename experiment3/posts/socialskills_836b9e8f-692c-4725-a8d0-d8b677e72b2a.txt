Why do all my conversations with girl's feel platonic? How can I make it intimate and flirty?
I treat girls like I treat guys. Just casual talking about random stuff. But I don't know how to take it further. I'm looking for deeper connections and I feel more comfortable doing that with girls. But I'm unable to build an emotional relationship with any of them. 

I don't know whether it's because of my childhood or something. I've never had a close relation with anyone my whole life. So I have literally never opened up to anyone in all these 22 years. It's terrifying when I think about it this way, but also I've lived all my life this way. However, I want to be close to someone emotionally.
