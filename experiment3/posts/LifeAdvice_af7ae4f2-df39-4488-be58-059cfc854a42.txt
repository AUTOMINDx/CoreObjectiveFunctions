My father
This open letter was supposed to be read at my dad's funeral since he wasn't that religious I thought to post it here. My father was not worlds best father but I loved him I ran to him every time I saw him and I cry every time I think about him. I wish I had talked to him more or visited him more I didn't know was going to die that firday. I miss hearing his voice, his jokes , the random stories form his childhood and his werud snore. I just can't accepted that he  is gone I wish he had taken better care of himself. Dad if you are reading this I am sorry and I forgive you.
