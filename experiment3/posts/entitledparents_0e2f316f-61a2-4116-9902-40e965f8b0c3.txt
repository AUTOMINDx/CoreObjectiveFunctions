My Christmas presents are ment to be for her children
Me (24f) and my dad's side of the family spend Christmas Eve every year at my grandmother's house. Usually it's a pretty wholesome family experience, but since my aunt (45f) became a mother, Christmas is always about her two children (8m &amp; 10f). It's all fine by me, I understand, that family gatherings are usually centered around the younger children. 

I am the first grandchild and my treatment was much more strict. They get their own food (fish sticks while the adults including me have regular fish), they get to eat with their hands and are allowed to leave the table earlier than the others. That already grinds my gears a little, because I had to follow strict rules when I was their age. But my grandmother allows it and she has the last word since it's her home. Whatever. 

The evening went kind of downhill for me when it was time to unpack Christmas presents. I am very excited to get presents every year and of course I spend a lot of time and passion when it comes to Christmas present for everyone else. 
Now to the relevant part: my entitled parent aunt got me two sets of Lego: the Chinese summer palace set and the matching dragon sets. It's not that kind of Lego that's actually exciting, after building it will just catch dust. It's just decoration. She was so excited and said "isn't that wonderful, the kinds can help you assemble all the pieces". 
I'm really not into Lego anymore and I didn't own any before that evening. However my aunt is a Lego collector and I have a strong feeling that she wanted to get me something her children would enjoy. It's a complete disregard to me and my personality. 

I think it's difficult to give presents to people with the idea that the own children might enjoy it more than the actual person itself.
