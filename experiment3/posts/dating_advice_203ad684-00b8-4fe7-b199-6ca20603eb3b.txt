The most attractive thing in a man is how happy and passionate he is.
(Edit: I love how literally all of the people saying shit like "you're wrong and women only want the sexiest alpha chads and they'll never love men with awesome personalities" well they're all dudes, no women or femcel's are here to say that men are superficial or to say that they're superficial instead it's just swathes of dude bros telling me what they think women think, all the lasses who have interacted with this post are agreeing with me 100% one of them even gave me one of those neat little awards.)

(Secondary edit: I've been barred from commenting so just to clarify I'm a cis white guy, 
I'm not a woman, 

also you can't expect me to reply to your anecdotes anymore, all I can say is if you're refuting this you're probably a terrible partner who just happens to be ugly, and you blame your failures on your appearance instead of looking at yourself on the inside)

I know a lot of you are looking for advice with women 

and you'll often come across these poorly shaven chuds who tell you that you need to be buff and rich and all this other guff,

 (as they don't really see women as people, rather they see women as prizes that go to the most protein guzzling alpha) 

but you just need to be passionate about something, 
the reason why so many people claim their physical beauty is the reason why they're so lonely is because they're sad about how they look. That creates a cycle where they just get sad about how they look, their sadness makes them undesirable, they get sad about that, blame their physical appearance for their undesirability and it just goes on and on until they're in a dangerous place.

Whereas there are plenty of men who aren't considered conventionally attractive who are dating women who are and visa versa

I have a friend she's very attractive and her boyfriend is overweight, is still in education and hasn't shaved in Frankly too long but he's a genuine and sweet guy who's always trying to make her happy, even if he gets a little defensive about her hanging out with majority male groups he still loves her and she loves him

Because as clich√© as it sounds people are more attracted to personality than anything.

Obviously women aren't a monolith and neither are men but it's worth pointing out how much people desire genuine people over someone who either has looks and nothing else or someone who just has nothing.
