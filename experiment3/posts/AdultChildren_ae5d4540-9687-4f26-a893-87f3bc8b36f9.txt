Lost my dad to alcoholism today.
I woke this morning around 7:00AM to find my dad motionless, pale, and cold on our living room couch with a bottle of Dubra next to him. He was 52, I am 22 and the oldest of 3 brothers who were all here when I found him. I watched as my mother (who is a nurse) struggled to do CPR, then the EMT people arrived and had to rip her off him, and then we went to the ER to say goodbye. They say he died of cardiac arrest. I don’t mean to trauma dump but I don’t have many people to confide in besides my mother’s family who I spent the day with. My mother’s father just died of Alzheimer’s related complications two weeks ago so this is extremely tough for her. He struggled with alcoholism for all of my life but the last two years have been nightmarish. He was always late, or absent from important events, and always drunk, but would never admit it. I was the last one to speak with him because I got up to pee at like midnight. He was watching a documentary on The Beatles. He wasn’t what you would call a “good guy” or even a “good parent”, but he was still my dad and I loved him. I just bought my first car and today I had planned to drive somewhere with him just because he was a car guy and I wanted him to assess how to upgrade the interior of this car. Unfortunately, I have too many stories and not enough energy to tell them. If anyone has any advice or tips for me I would really appreciate it.
