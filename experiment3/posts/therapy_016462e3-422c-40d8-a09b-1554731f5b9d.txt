why do I cry when I’m angry and how do I stop it?
I’m 23f and I’ve always had this issue. Anytime I’m angry or frustrated or overwhelmed I cry. I’m not even sad I’m just frustrated. And I hate it. This happens over the smallest things too.
From a psychological perspective why does this happen? How can I control it? I can feel when I’m getting to that threshold and the tears are forming but I can’t stop it. I feel like it just goes from 0 to 100 soo fast and then it’s too late. I really want to be able to manage this better so any tips/resources would be appreciated!
