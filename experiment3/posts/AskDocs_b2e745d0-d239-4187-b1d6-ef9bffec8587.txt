Red spot on grandson's face.
My grandson (boy) is 16 months old.  He lives a few states away.  I visited him the week of November 11.  I noticed a red spot on his face about the size of a pencil eraser.   My daughter just sent me a picture.   It's larger and rough.   Again, he is 16 months old, weighs 19 pounds and is 30 inches long.   He does not take any medication.  There are no other spots anywhere on his body,  he does not rub it or act like it bothers him in any way.   Anyone know what this is?
