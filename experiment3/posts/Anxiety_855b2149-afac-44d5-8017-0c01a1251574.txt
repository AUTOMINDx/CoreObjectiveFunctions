Anxiety from my boss texting me after hours
Ive “muted” her texts but need to turn them back on during the daytime.. I’ve put my phone in DND mode but can’t even use it for fun or to be social without the anxiety that the text tone I heard was her or the next time I check my phone will have a message from her. It makes me feel physically sick. I paid for this phone and I should be able to use it outside of work with the freedom from her and fear of consequence. 

The boundaries conversation backfired last year - apparently being available all the time is part of the industry and if I can’t handle it or get over it, I should try an easier career path. 

Just wanted to vent. Thanks if you read it.
