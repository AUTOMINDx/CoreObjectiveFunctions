If you are a freeze type, is it common to not have any motivation?
Like specifically intrinsic motivation. Being able to motivate yourself for an internal reward. Like drawing a picture just for the challenge of it, or the joy of making it. 

I don’t really seem to have any motivation beyond eating, going to the bathroom, and mindlessly surfing the web. 

Everything seems so pointless. Like what’s the use in doing anything? 

Is this a freeze response? I’m sure it’s depression, but is it more than depression? What is depression anyway. Just a sense of hopelessness and lack of emotions.

This is like the opposite of adhd. Is there a drug for this?
