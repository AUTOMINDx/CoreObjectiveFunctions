Possibly find your big three twin?
Iâ€™ve just started looking into astrology as another means of self discovery and really have resonated with what Iâ€™ve found. 

Iâ€™m interested to see if anyone has the same big three placements. Maybe you all can find your own twin in the process? I just canâ€™t believe how spot on it is. 

Iâ€™m a Virgo sun, Sagittarius moon, and Aries rising! ðŸ–¤

Edit: canâ€™t believe so many people have commented and not one person is my twin. ðŸ¥º
