Is there any culture in which women aren't the primary caretakers of kids?
Given the fact that young kids need to drink their mother's milk, I get the impression it it would be impossible for any pre-refrigeration¹ culture to have men be the primary caretakers of kids.

Is there any counterexample for this?

¹ I am talking here only about modern refrigeration. If an old culture managed to find another way to refrigerate or preserve human milk, I am definitely interested in them.
