Terrified of Telling My Company of 5+ Years that I'm Quitting
I've worked with my company for 5+ years and by all measures they've been pretty great to me and I'm really thankful for all I've learned and how much I've grown. I have a new opportunity--it's not like my \~dream\~ job but I do think it offers some things my current position does not (including 40k+ more in salary), is a stepping stone towards the direction I want to take my career and also I think it may be time to just try something different. 

That said, my coworkers are some of my closest friends and the timing is just tricky and I know I'll get shit for leaving etc. I know you can't just stay somewhere forever because you don't want to hurt people's feelings or deal with confrontation but I am having a hard time just cutting ties. Would love some advice/encouragement.
