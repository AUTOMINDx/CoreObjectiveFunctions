Have you ever noticed that many mangers are narcissistic or sociopaths?
Iâ€™ve had a few bad experiences with managers and when I researched the characteristics they possessed, my research usually revealed that they had narcissistic or sociopathic traits. I had one manager who used to horribly verbally abuse me in private, but as soon as the big boss (CEO) came down, she put on her fake smiley face. Anybody experience anything like this before?
