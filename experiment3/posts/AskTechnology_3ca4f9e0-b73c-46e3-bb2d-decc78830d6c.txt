What are some examples of advanced 21st century technology that are surprisingly stil being made by machines dating back to WW2?
I was recently browsing some old reddit threads and forums, especially those related to lathes and machining and came across a number of threads and posts describing how their companies or businesses still use lathes that were in use back in WW2. 

An example was a thread (posted in Feb 2021) I came across about a giant lathe made in 1914 used to make battleship cannons that is now used service rock crushers.

This might be apocrypha, but I also remember reading an online post about how after the fall of the Soviet Union, during the early 1990s, a member of a group of Western investors touring aircraft manufacturing facilities described finding lathes, machines presses and milling machines both made in wartime Germany (taken back to Russia after the war was over) and also supplied by the US under the Lend-Lease effort , being used to produce what was the latest generation of the then-USSR aircraft models. I can't find the online post anymore and couldn't verify it anyway.

But it got me thinking, what are some examples of 21st century technology that can actually being made by machining technology dating back to the the 1940s? Meaning the machinists and engineers of the 1940s had the means but not the knowledge.
