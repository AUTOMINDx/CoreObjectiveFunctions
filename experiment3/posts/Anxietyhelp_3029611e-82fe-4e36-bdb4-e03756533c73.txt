I'm having constant panic attacks and they won't go away!
Ive been having panic attacks every night for the past month and they're getting worse. I'm afraid of what might happen after death and nothing I do is helping. My family tells me don't worry about it or gives encouraging advice yet none of it works! I'm scared and I want it to stop!! Please help!
