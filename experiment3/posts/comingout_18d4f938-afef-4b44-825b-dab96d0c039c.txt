i’ve came out twice to my parents and they still think i’m straight.
hi, i grew up in a very mormon household. i’ve never necessarily struggled with my sexuality luckily, i’ve known i wasn’t straight since i was about 10. at this point the guilt had built up and i confessed to my parents i thought i was gay or bi. they told me i was too young to know (mom, i jerk off to chris evans every night, but ok) so i just brushed it off. a few months later i once again went to my father for advice on my viewing of gay porn. he treated it like i was addicted to porn, and completely ignored the gay aspect of it. it’s been like 4 ish years since then, and i still am so anxious about what they do or don’t know. do they know im bi, or have they just suppressed it and pretended like it didn’t happen? i want nothing else but to be out, and i feel so deeply invalidated. i don’t know why this has me feeling so anxious.
