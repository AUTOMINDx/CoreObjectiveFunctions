How far above the plane of the Milky Way would you have to send a satellite to be able to see what the Great Attractor is? And how long would it take with current technologies?
I hear we don't know what the Great Attractor is because it's obscured by the Milky Way. So basically the title. I'm assuming communicating data back to Earth wouldn't be an issue, but if it would be, why?
