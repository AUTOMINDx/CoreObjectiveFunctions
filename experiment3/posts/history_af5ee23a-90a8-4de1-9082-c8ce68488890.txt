How common was it in the early and mid 20th century to carry large amounts of cash?
What prompted this question was a scene in a movie from the 1950s where a guy hops on an overnight train on the spur of the moment and pays nearly $50 cash for a ticket, which is the equivalent of about $500 today. He had no prior plans to take a long trip. How realistic was this at the time? Did people back then ordinarily carry around the equivalent of hundreds or thousands of dollars without expecting to make a large purchase?
