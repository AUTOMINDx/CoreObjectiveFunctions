[California] Is it likely HR will accommodate a split shift / hybrid office-home hours for an exempt salary worker? [CA]
Before I ask my boss I thought I would check with HR if they could let me work 5 hours then on my break let me go home and work the balance of my shift from home. Do you see pros and cons with this? They currently want us to come in person but I know some work remotely at least once/week. Any suggestions so I get the green light as it would help not sitting in traffic too.
