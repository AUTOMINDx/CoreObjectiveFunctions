I live in an isolating location, never had any chance to even socialize. Should I go to college?
I've been told its a bad idea (cause debt and all.) but the alternative is getting a job and being isolated despite all that. Atleast, In college I'll be given some room to figure myself out and what I want to do. Only problem is that I'm incredibly poor, and I will probably take some financial hit as a result. I've been told by my friends it's a really stupid idea and that I should go to a trade school, but I don't know if my calling is anything blue collar (not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just not sure I could do any of that while sleep deprived and I have chronic sleep issues.) 

So.. what should I do? I'm all alone and I'm tired of it. It's starting to tear at me and my mental health and I want out of where I live so fucking fast. If I have to end up in college debt I'm willing to take that risk.
