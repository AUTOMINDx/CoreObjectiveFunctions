Who are the Most Prominent Medical Anthropologists Studying Psychedelics?
Who are some of the most credible or noteworthy medical anthropologists who focus on medicinal or ritualized use of psychedelic substances? I have found some ethnobotanical literature on the subject, but when I look at anthropology programs across the US, almost no professors seem to indicate that this topic is a specialty of theirs. I find this perplexing, because there is so much buzz around this topic at the moment, especially in neuroscience and psychology, and this is a topic that is very much relevant to discussions around traditional medicine, spirituality, and indigeneity. From my vantage point, noteworthy scholars who study psychedelics tend to be a bit more insular, being more reputable in circles revolving around psychedelics themselves than in anthropological circles. Can anybody shed light on this particular question? It would be greatly appreciated.
