i wish I had the finances to completely disappear and never be seen by anyone ever again Imao
The older I get the more I can’t stand being around people and the way they live their fake lives. I especially hate this time of the year as well which is why I wish I could just disappear and not have to deal with it since the only thing I’m reminded of during this time is how much I’m not loved or cared for by anyone on this planet
