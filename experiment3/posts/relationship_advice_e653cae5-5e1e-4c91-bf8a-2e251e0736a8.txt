Caught my BIL cheating on my sister. I don’t know if I should tell her because Knowing her, she would probably shoot the messenger
My (f36) sister(30f) is newly married to this very handsome very rich and very very obnoxious dude (m35). My sister is shallow and always judged people by their appearance so even if no body in the family like her man she is happily bragging about how “perfect” he is and how we’re just jealous of her luck. 

This morning, on my was to work I saw him getting out of a hotel with a hot 20 something into a cab. I obviously followed them. They went to a breakfast place. They were kissing and touching each other. I drove to work.

I don’t know if I should tell my sister. I mean of course I should but knowing her, she will probably hate me for bursting her bubble of fake happiness and our relationship is already strained that I don’t think it could survive a blow like this. At the same time, she’s planning on having children and I believe she should get out asap before she’s a single mom co-parenting with a nightmare of a man. I haven’t told anyone yet, not even my husband because I don’t know…….
