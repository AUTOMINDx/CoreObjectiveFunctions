I feel so shitty about wanting to keep emotional distance from my mom
It feels like I should be more "grateful." After all, she buys me gifts, houses me, pays for my education, and makes sure there is healthy food on the table. On top of that, she is also, in some ways, affectionate with me a lot of time.

Yet, I still feel an immense emotional distance between us that I'm terrified will never be repaired and feel responsible for it. While she is there for me in a material sense, we have absolutely no connection on an emotional level. She is a workaholic immigrant who seems to place working on her laptop 25 hours a day 8 days a week ahead of her family. The last time my dad left for work related stuff abroad and my sibling and I were left with her, it was a combination of her ordering pizzas for us, trying to organize a tiny home COVID birthday party for me (both of which seemed so nice and affectionate), and just endlessly working, emotionally ignoring us, drinking a lot, and calling me a disappointment for not wanting kids. I have stopped talking to her even about academic achievements because it feels like she shuts me down in that area as well. I could have absolutely worked my ass off to receive full credit on something and that still wouldn't be enough to receive a proper congratulations from her.

When I was younger, I went selectively mute around her for two years because I felt so unseen. When I was an insomniac and suffered with my mental health, I felt like she "saw through me" and wasn't there for me emotionally in a way that I needed her to be as a 13 year old young person. When I went mute, she labeled me "cold" and "robotic," "emotionless," and "arrogant" for not replying to her when she spoke to me. I was so emotionally distraught from lack of support, and to be called those things and have her genuinely believe them stung. Years later, she still believes those things about me are true. Additionally, when I was younger, I had to quit a sport because of an injury. She KNEW that quitting was kind of traumatizing for me because it was my passion and brought me so much joy. She turned around and started using that event as a sort of "conversation starter," going around emphasizing to people how distraught I was and blah, blah. I cried once in front of guests because I couldn't handle the event being spoken about like that. Felt like a wound being torn open with no regard for how I felt.

As I've been growing up and having new life experiences, I wish I had the capacity to have a real, intimate conversation with her and finally repair all of this. But she seems as unreceptive to that as ever before. It feels like she never takes me seriously. I repeated a thing from school that I told her about four times over the phone, and today she asked me about it again as if she had completely forgotten what I said. It feels like she doesn't listen or care.

Today was Christmas and I cried because something about being around her made me want to cry. For some reason, just being around her makes me sad and angry. Seeing her and my dad in love knowing that they are both homophobic and wouldn't support me if I had my own partner also stung. I feel like I'm living this fraud life at home and feel like I should be more grateful for all the ways in which they are materially supporting me because some families don't even have that.

I have just been feeling shitty recently and blaming myself for having these thoughts because I feel like I should be more grateful. It's a case of not wanting to "bite the hand that feeds" I guess. At the same time, the mental health progress I have made on my own all these years is telling me that I deserve better love and shouldn't waste my energy on this. I feel torn and don't know what to do.

Any advice is appreciated. I'm still a teen by the way, so complete financial independence isn't really an option for me.
