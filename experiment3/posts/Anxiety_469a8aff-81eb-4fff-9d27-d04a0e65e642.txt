Psychiatrist won’t let me use the word “anxiety”
my psychiatrist won’t let me say the word “anxiety”. I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder for 7 years. I also have a form of OCD.

I’ve been seeing him for a few months. It’s so hard to find a psychiatrist and schedule an appointment that I’ve only seen him a handful of times. I’ve told him all my issues with anxiety. And for the last few sessions every-time I say the word “anxiety” he rolls his eyes. LITERALLY ROLLS HIS EYES. And tells me that what I’m feeling isn’t “anxiety” it’s actually just something like “nervousness”, “excited”, etc. I told him “well what I’m feeling feels bad”. He told me “you THINK it feels bad”. ???. No actually I KNOW it feels bad, I’m there. Doesn’t feel great when it feels like my throat is closing up when I’m in traffic and I can’t breathe. I cried after the meeting cuz I was so frustrated. Just wanted to vent that out. I’m gonna ask my doctor to refer me elsewhere.

Edit: this conversation also happened because I told him I was avoiding taking my adderall (5mg-15mg depending on need quick release but still) because I was afraid to take stimulants that might rouse up my anxiety
