Did Native Americans make it to Europe before 1492?
I read an account where Christopher Columbus talked about men and women from Cathay of extraordinary appearance washing up dead (I read another account that they were alive) on two logs (probably canoes) in Galway in 1477 in the book “God’s Shadow” by Alan Mikhail. The author then goes on to casually say that this happened with some regularity across Europe and Africa but doesn’t go into detail. Did this actually happen and are there other accounts of it from Europeans or Africans?
