19yo Gay Christian comes out to Christian Friend
I just came out to one of my close friends but it was very confusing. He said that he wasn’t going to treat me any different and that he appreciates me being comfortable enough to share that part of my life with him, BUT that he disagrees with the lifestyle. Things are as he said, unchanged, but that kinda takes away the purpose of me coming out to him. I came out so I wouldn’t have to hide my sexuality but now we both avoid talking about it because of the unsettling vibes it creates between us . He’s gets uncomfortable, then I get uncomfortable because he’s uncomfortable, the we’re both uncomfortable, and yea…I don’t know what to do going forward…also if you have any gay Christian friends 🥺👉🏾👈🏾
