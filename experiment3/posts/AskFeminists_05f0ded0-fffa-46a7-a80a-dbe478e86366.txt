Is sexual harassment more common in extroverted countries?
So I have heard that in countries like Finland or Germany sexual harassment does not occur often. However this is not necessarily because these countries are feminist, but because you generally don't talk to strangers there. Instead harassment often occurs in countries like Italy or Brazil where people tend to be more uninhibited about talking to strangers. What do you think?
