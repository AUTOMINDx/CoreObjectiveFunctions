Are there other families who are as weird as mine?
About 30 minutes ago family members of mine got into a fight because one of them was pouring chip bags into bowls instead of eating them out of the bag.

That just seems crazy to me. Why would someone argue about that?

The argument was that one family members thinks it looks cool to have chips in bowls and the other thinks it's wasting bowls.

This is basically why I want to be alone forever though. It's just crazy to me.
