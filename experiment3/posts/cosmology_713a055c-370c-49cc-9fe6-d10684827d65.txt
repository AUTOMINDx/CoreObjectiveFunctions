Questions for Brian Cox?!?
I’m attending a lecture by Brian Cox in April and want to take the time until then to find a great question to ask him if I get the chance. If you guys have any ideas please let me know and I will of course give credit! Not phishing for a question because I’m lazy but because I’m curious and I know there are a lot more creative people out there.
