Should facial hair become gender neutral?
For me I’ve always thought one of the end states of feminism is any behavior or lifestyle traditionally assigned to one sex is just seen as neutral options, a women in pants, suit and tie, defined muscles, and business shoes next to a male nanny in one of those blouses, would be completely normal. And I think realistically (and thankfully)most of the stereotypically female trappings would be phased out for various reasons(heels and makeup outside of performers). 

Yet despite that I can imagine beards being anything but a male thing, (women shouldn’t feel the need to obsessively shave if they grow a lot naturally, just as I’ll never be clean shaven because of how fast it grows), but is there any desire among women to grow facial hair as an aesthetic option, or for it to at least become an acceptable choice?
