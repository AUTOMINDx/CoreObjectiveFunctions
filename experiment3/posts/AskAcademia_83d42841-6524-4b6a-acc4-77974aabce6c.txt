Need a letter of recommendation for PhD program application from advisor I ghosted
TLDR; Basically the title. I graduated in May 2020 with honors for my undergraduate thesis. My advisor was quite helpful during the process and wanted to build my thesis into a fully-fledged paper for publication.   

He got in touch with me in May 2021 (a year after I’d graduated) and put me in touch with one of his colleagues who’d worked on a similar topic. The agreement was his colleague and I would work on the empirical side, building on my thesis and he would work on the modeling side. The final paper would be authored by all 3 of us. Anyway, his colleague stopped replying to my emails a couple of months down the line. I’d also started a new job around the time and really didn’t want to work on this project (dumb, I know, since a publication would’ve looked really good for what I’m aiming for now). I never got back in touch with my advisor about the progress.   

 I lost access to my university email around the time, so I’m not sure if he ever tried reaching out to me. I realize I messed up by not updating him and not reaching out at all (about my work or life in general) in the last 5 months.    

I’m applying to PhD programs for next Fall and I need a letter of recommendation from him about 8 months from now. I’m not sure how I should reach out to him. Should I explain the whole fiasco about his colleague not replying to me/losing access to my university email? Should I not consider him at all for a LOR? I had a good relationship with him but I’m scared I may have ruined it through this unprofessional lack of communication. Any advice is appreciated.
