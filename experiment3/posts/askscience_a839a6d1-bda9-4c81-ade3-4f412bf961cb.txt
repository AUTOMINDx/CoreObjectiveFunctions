Is weathering/erosion of rock by water more due to chemical or mechanical processes?
I was reading this page: [https://opengeology.org/textbook/5-weathering-erosion-and-sedimentary-rocks/](https://opengeology.org/textbook/5-weathering-erosion-and-sedimentary-rocks/)

And while they indicate here that "chemical" weathering is the primary mechanism, wouldn't "mechanical" be the most significant factor?  As in, moving/falling water would cause more weathering than still water over the same time period?  And wouldn't faster moving water cause more weathering than slower moving water?
