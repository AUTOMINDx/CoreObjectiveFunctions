Do any other introverts “shut down” after a while of socialising?
I’m an introvert and I find I’m quite if not very social for the first two hours and then when it approaches anything after that. I feel my energy levels twinkle and I resort to just listening to the group conversation and start contributing less. 

Anyone else have this?
