Has anyone else ever had such bad dissociation that they couldnâ€™t speak?
Today I got triggered and had an episode in which I felt so emotionally numb and frozen. Worst of all, I had to text my gf what I was trying to communicate to them because I could not talk unless I really pushed myself. Has anyone else experienced this?
