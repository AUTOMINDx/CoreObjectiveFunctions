23 with a masters and working retail
I got my masters in marketing analytics and graduated during a hard time in my life. With covid effecting the whole school experience and having multiple family deaths in a short period of time, I graduated emotionally empty, depressed and burnt out.
I spend the next months resting and healing. Afterwards I tried applying to jobs but was only able to land a PT at Barnes and noble. Worst part is that I’m not even competent enough to do well there. I make many mistakes I shouldn’t be making and it really hurts my confidence. Enough so that I would be surprised if I’m fired soon.
I’ve met my old high school teacher and some friends while I’m working and it leave a bad taste taste in my throat thinking how this is where I am compared to where they are. I even had friends question if this is what I’m aiming for when I have an advanced degree when I told them about the job. I’m still applying to other FT office jobs but I don’t even know if I want to do that. Life is sucking the life out of me.

Update: thanks for all the comments! I’m surprise this blew up so quickly. We will get through this rollercoaster of a life. :)
