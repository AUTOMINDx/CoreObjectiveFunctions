How do I emulate what streamers do for my daughter.
My daughter, only 6yo, loves watching influencers play games, Lanky Box being her favourite.

I built her a PC so she could play Minecraft, and bought her a webcam. Little did I know she's been making videos on the hard drive, saying crap like "Like and Subscribe" lol.

How do I do what the streamers do? I.e. Record the screen while also video recording you. What software do I need? Will a Ryzen 3600 and a 1660 be up to the job?

I don't want her to be putting videos out to the public at this age, but is there like a way to make your you tube videos private?

Thanks for any help, I'm good with PCs when it comes to building or gaming, I just don't have a clue where to start when it comes to emulating streaming.

Edit: Did not expect this post to get so much traction, but thanks for all your input. I'm going to be super Dad with all this advice! Thank you.

Edit 2: I also built the PC without a WiFi card, so it needs a dongle to connect to the Internet. So whenever she's unsupervised I remove the dongle, meaning she can play her games but not get into mischief.

Edit 3: To re-enforce, and a shout out for building your own PCs, when she is unsupervised I remove the USB WiFi antenna so she literally has no access to the Internet unsupervised.
