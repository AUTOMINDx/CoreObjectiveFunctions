Hard to Relate to Most of You
A lot of you people feel bad for being a narc. Like why? Just accept it. Why do you want to internalize society's stigma? society was the one that warped you after all...

I'm not saying having NPD is the tits. It sucks to have to regulate your self-esteem through external sources. It's tiring. I get it. But like it's not all bad. You have megaconfidence and shit. Use it.

Stop whining and quit the pity party.
