My Therapist is Retiring
She told me towards the end of our session yesterday and I bawled uncontrollably. This woman literally saved my life, time after time. I've been with her for a year and 5 months, which started after I experienced extreme trauma as an adult. She's been by my side through everything, I feel such an emotional attachment to her and the journey she guided me through. Not to mention, a huge component of our health plan is to prepare me for an upcoming trial with the person who inflicted the trauma. She'll be gone by then and I'll have to begin again with a stranger.

On the bright side, I have never been more healed than I am today. Our session yesterday was the first time since beginning treatment that I was able to say I feel no major depressive symptoms. She told me that I am blossoming and that I am ready to fly. I still need therapy, and I trust that she will find me a good match, but I'm having a hard time with the thought of this transition.
