I need advice please. What's a good last gift for my kids?
Idk if I suffer from anything mentally. But every day I feel suicidal. I'm always afraid to leave my room to where I always starve myself. I never go to work. I ignore every activity outside of work. My friends and family. I ignore them too. Now don't get my wrong I'm not doing all this for attention or for pity or whatever bull shit someone wants to say. I just can't motivate myself. I have a story like everyone for why I feel this way. It's long but I'm gonna try to shorten it down. Lived ward of the state for a bit.  Father found me raised me til I was 10. Had a abusive relationship with him and all his flings. Got raped by a baby sitter. Ran. Lived life with friends. Got caught because I was hustling and fighting for money. Went to juvie. Became a ward again. Met my family at 18. Tried to be their kid for a few months. Didn't work out. Love my fam but I don't know them. Went back to my home town. Dealt again. Lost myself in drugs and depression.got out cause I thought I met the one. She had a kid. But neglected him. She wanted to do better. So I tried to help. Fell in love with both of them. Couldn't help but cut drugs. Be a role model. Found her cheating alot. Tried to keep it together cause I thought she was pregnant and I loved her kid like my own. Even told me he can be mine if I sign his birth certificate.  She ended up being pregnant. One of my old role models used to say. You get her pregnant marry her. So I did. Day before we got married. Her friends caught her cheating major. Didn't tell me thou. We got married. Found out after. Got depressed. Tried to hold it together. Had on and off 5 jobs. And watched after the kids at night after work. Slept in between jobs.stayed like that for a year. She never worked. Knew how to spend money thou. Came down where I didn't love her any more. But Tried to make it work for the kids. Dealt with all of shit during that. Never once raised a hand on her. Tried to get her out the picture. Legally. But gave up. She kinda convinced me. Couple months go by. I tell her let me help her reconnect with her family. And let the kids have a chance with her fam too. We move. 3 day trip. Thought things got better. Get there. Small town. Rains. Humid. Although different from where I'm from. Tried to make it work. Got a job. A good job. Couldn't do it thou. Non stop kept getting sick. So sick I lied about it but they saw through me. They wouldn't let me work. We lived with her fam at this point. She told me everyday. I want you gone. I want you to leave. Your not fit as a parent. I got mad. Those things I was told. It got to me. I kept trying. Til I had no choice. She seemed sure on kicking me out. I had no where to go. My crew in my home town told me to get out. To just go her family too. My son 3. My daughter not even 1. I couldn't leave them. But I had no where to go. So I made the plan to leave. My friends paid for everything. Flight, Uber, etc. Told her and my kids that fine I'll go. Give me 1 day and I'm gone. She seemed happy about it. I guess some shit clicked when she realized I was really gonna go. Begged me to stay. Guilt tripped me. Fucked with my feelings. Even after I left. Went into limbo. Not even sure what to do. Just sat in my room lost. Tried working. So I could send money. Was allowed to talk to my kids. But Normally after I pay. I still had access to her accounts. And still got the bank statements.  Months later noticed a pattern. Money I sent. Always went to personal things for her. Only thing the kids got were McDonald's. Got mad.tried to argue about it then stopped. I didn't want that for the kids. Stopped sending money. Put it aside thou. She got plenty of money from what her family tells me. She treatens me to not see the kids if she doesn't get paid. I told her fuck that. She has no right. Still did it anyways. Cops and law couldn't do anything since it was complicated. It involved 3 states. Etc. Etc. Finally got to talk to them. But that was it. Got depressed again. Lost hope. Had no more desires. Lawyers told me that we go thru with everything. I'd lose all rights to my son. He's not mine. And I'd have to get a DNA test. For the both of them kids. What would I do if they both aren't mine. Could I handle that. Stopped with the legal stuff. Gave up on life. Kept trying to talk to my kids but couldn't. She wouldn't let me. Had no money. Stopped working became a bum who only works at the last moment for rent. Got affected by covid. Lost my job. Got behind on everything. Shit I can't even afford rent this month. Even my bills. Lost all motivation. I just want to give up. Kids probably don't remember me. I wouldn't even be surprised to find out my daughter's not mine. Like wtf. The fuck I do all that for. But I don't wanna find out. I can't give up on my son either. He's not mine but. That's not fair. To him. To both my kids. But I'm a selfish mofo. Ik I am. I'm burning bridges. Or on my way to. I need to get my life together. My health. Shit haven't eaten in 3 days. Last had a poptart. I'm used to it.i hate everything. Nigh on almost everyone. But I shouldn't. I just want die. Because regardless what I do I fail. Now don't get me fucked up I'm not asking for shit. I won't even be surprised if no one cares. It's my own issue. Just needed to rant honestly. I'm already planning to kms. I'm gonna push thru with my job for a month. Pay back the immediate money I owe to fam and friends. Catch my bills back up. Then leave. My roommates will be ight. They know I wanna leave. I owe them a clean slate at least. The last of my money I'll go back to my hometown. Get fucked up. Then I'll jump off. So many buildings there. But seriously what should I leave for my kids? A necklace? I don't fucking know anymore. I hope there's another life after this. Meh whatever I'm cursed anyways. My kids will be alright. I'm just another worthless male. A shit. I'm still married guys. Whatever. I'll let her figure that out. I'm done with everything now. Just hope those that are making it make it. Same to my kids. Hope they make it.
