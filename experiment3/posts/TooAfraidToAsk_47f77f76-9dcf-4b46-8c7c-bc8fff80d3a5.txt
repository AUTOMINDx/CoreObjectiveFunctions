Do Westeners always use toilet paper even in the house to wipe their ass after pooping?
I'm from Southeast Asia and its common for us to use a bidets to wash our asses with water rather than wiping it with a toilet paper unless if there is no water around.

Toilet paper is not much sellable here and only bought a few rolls of it just to use as hand wipes.
