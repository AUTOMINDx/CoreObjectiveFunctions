Why. Why. Why. Why me.
Why. Why. Why. Why is the world like this. Why. Youcould do everything right and still get fucked over for shit that ain't your fault. I'm 14, I hate this. I hate feeling like nothing is real every night, having nothing to look forward to in the next day. It's all the same, the same bullshit. I hate not living my life. I want it back. My sense of reality and time is so warped I can't figure out what is real. I'm so stressed I cry to sleep some nights. I feel like it's never ending. The only things keeping me together are distant dreams of nothing. It feels like it will never get better. Like I'm already too far to go back. I've had one good day in about a month. Nobody understands. I can't just be left alone. Every interaction feels forced. Nothing feels real, yet I'm forced to act as though it is. Fuck this mortal flesh prison. Truly. It's eating me alive. Why do I have to suffer? I feel so trapped. Everything feels like a blur. I'm tired. I'm tired of it all. I want to feel happy again, without thinking nothing is real and I am worth nothing along with all my surroundings.
