I will be with another man for couple days (she said )
After having sex, She (F45) said that she has to ask me (45M) something (kind of unsure about asking).
 “I invited a friend to come over for couple days for Christmas, he is an old friend”. She said .

I ask “ what is the question ? Because that sounds like a fact “, then she asks “well I want to know if you will be fine with this? Will this upset you or made you mad at me? “.

I said “well it will be weird but I do not think that I should be mad at all because you are telling me and I am guessing that you aren’t more than friends, correct?”

To what she said “yes we are friends from many years ago , he has been in my house before with her girlfriend but he doesn’t have a girlfriend now, but I want to mention that I have zero attraction for him, I just thought to let you know just in case that you might want to come over and so you won’t have a surprise about who this guy is?”.

I thanked her for being honest, followed by : “because I do have female friends that could sleep under my same roof without wanting to sleep with them at all , I can relate”.

So I am being oblivious on this?, Or did I do the right thing?

Note: we are recently “dating “ but we are keeping some kind of emotional distance (as per my suggestion because I come from an mental abusive relationship and I wasn’t looking to start a new relationship at all), we have great conversations, we enjoy cuddling , meals together, so is not a simple hook up or FWB that just jump on bed to do “our thing “ and left (I know is complicated to explain ) but we have the agreement to be exclusives.
