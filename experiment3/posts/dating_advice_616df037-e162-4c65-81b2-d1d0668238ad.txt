Does it take having sex for a men to be assured in his feelings?
I heard this recently on a podcast and was curious about other's thoughts. This podcaster was discussing being ghosted after sex, and the whole debate about it. Brought up an interesting view point: "It doesn't matter when you have sex with a guy, you could wait a month or have sex on the first date, and while waiting longer can create a deeper emotional connection, men normally realize their true intentions with a woman after sleeping with them." Thought it was an interesting take!

Edit: this was stated by a man on his podcast in the discussion of if having sex on the first date ruins your chances of forming a relationship. In this particular case, the girl was ghosted after.
