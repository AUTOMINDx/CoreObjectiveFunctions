How Period Accurate was Benedetta?
Benedetta is a new film by Paul Verhoeven that takes place in the 1600s and is about the Catholic Church at the time. I am interested in knowing how period accurate the production design, costuming, dialogue, and general depictions of life are.

Did people dress that way, use that type of vocabulary, Use those objects, Get tortured that way, Did people really wipe their ass with straw they way they do in the film? Etcetera. 

If they're are any historians out there who can educate me, I would love to know after seeing the film. Please link or forward any resources that may also help or answer this question.
