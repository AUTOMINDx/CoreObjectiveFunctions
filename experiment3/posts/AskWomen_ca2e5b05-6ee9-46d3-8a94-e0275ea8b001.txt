How do you deal with the guilt of cutting people off from your life?
Edit: To all asking why guilt- the scenario could be that they weren't necessarily a bad person but you cut them off cause your values didnt really align and you didn't want their energy in your life (despite them having meant a lot to you / been really close) etc.
