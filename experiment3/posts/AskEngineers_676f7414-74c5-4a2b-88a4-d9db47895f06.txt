Why don't we build bridges like we used to?
So, I live in a town with a 70 year old concrete bridge over a river that is now constantly undergoing some kind of  repair because the rebar or something is rusting and the concrete is cracking. A little bit further up the river there is a 150 year old stone arch bridge with trains running over it that needs no repairs.

It just makes me wonder why on earth we don't see more modern stone archway bridges like that being built? I figure with the tools and machines we have today we could probably cut the blocks really precisely and have that bridge relatively upkeep free for a long time. What am i missing here?
