Being aware of my feelings = being overwhelmed with depression and melancholy
For the longest time I've learnt to put on a mask to hide my sadness, melancholy and depressive feelings from work colleagues, friends and family. 

I've learnt to smother my feelings and get through a company function, family get together or when spending time with friends. 

I'm not depressed all the time, just a lot of the time. 

I feel like getting in touch with my feelings and letting my emotions flow can be dangerous. Imagine being in an important meeting at work and I go silent or worse yet break down in tears.
