Did anyone else notice throughout their recovery process that a large chunk of their trauma actually originated from the "better" parent?
The focus of my therapist was originally fully on the physical and emotional abuse of my dad. I always stressed to him, that while the abuse was bad, he was always the loving part of the family. My therapist hated it when I said that for some reason and was very adamant on me cutting ties to him. While that might or might not have been a good choice, after some years of downward spiraling I noticed what was actually lacking and completely hindering my ability to have any meaningful relationships and my well-being was the lack of self-love. I don't know how exactly it happened but life decided I had to learn that the hard way and sent me into an utter abyss of depression which took me years to recover from. During that time I only really started crying for myself and properly grieving all the pain that was inside me, it was the first time I started grieving all the injustice I felt for not being able to continue my life the way I wanted it too. 

And during that time I met the most wonderful people in life. And I met exactly one person that gave me so much love and acceptance that I was so grateful for. I used to visit her in her dorm and she had a little sticky note next to her bed written by her mom basically just telling her how wonderful she was. And by that I think I realized what I was truly missing my whole life. A loving mother. Because my mother did not have emotions. She was as cold as a rock. Even though she did not know it, she secretely hated me and I guess thought she was a good parent because she herself probably never experienced any love herself and just thought that was how a normal mother-child relationship looked like.
