Is there any evidence for the reason behind the gender paradox in suicide?
In most Western countries women have higher rates of suicide attempts than men, yet mortality from suicide is typically lower for women than for men.


I've heard some people explain this as women choosing less lethal means of suicide due to caring more about not leaving a mess for their loved ones, and I've heard other people say that the statistics are indicative of a stronger degree of intent to die in men than women and that's why women use less lethal means. Although I've seen both explanations used, I've never seen anyone back it up with evidence.


Since both theories have problematic implications, is there actually any evidence to either one? Or are both wrong?
