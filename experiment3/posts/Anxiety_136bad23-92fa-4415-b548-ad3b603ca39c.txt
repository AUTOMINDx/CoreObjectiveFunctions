Why does it feel the older I get, I become more anxious?
I always hear it’s the opposite.. I’m 37 years old and each year I’m more anxious than the last. It’s interesting, because I feel I’ve become more humble, confident, and I know who I am; I like myself, but I just always feel like I’m always overwhelmed by anxiety, that becomes more crippling the older I get.
