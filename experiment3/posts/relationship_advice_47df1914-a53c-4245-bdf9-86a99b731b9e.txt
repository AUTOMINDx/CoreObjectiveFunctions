I daydream about future fictional relationships I may have when I’m already in a committed relationship.
I’ll try to do my best to explain this. I’ve(19F) been in a relationship with my boyfriend(19M) for a year already and everything seems to be all good. 

I’m quite a daydreamer and a hopeless romantic.
I’ve recently realized that I start to think about a future where I’m single and I meet someone else and I make up stories about it. Or that I’m just single and enjoying my life. Granted I may have read too many romance comics by now, maybe I even got addicted. But lately I feel like I’m more excited about my thoughts and my made up stories than my real life relationship. 

I want to hear opinions on this. Does this happen to others?
