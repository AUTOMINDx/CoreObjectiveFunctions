Razer Headset recognized as Realtek (R) Audio
Hello! So, I have a Predator Helios 300 laptop and I got a Razer BlackShark V2 X headset for Christmas. I specifically got this one for the mic. My issue is, I can use the headphones part just fine BUT the mic isn't recognized. When I go into Sounds and Recording, my mic shows up as disconnected. Even the headset itself shows up as disconnected even though I'm listening to videos through it. When I try to right click and connect them, nothing happens. What is connected in the Playback section is Realtek (R) Audio and in the Recording section it's also Realtek (R) Audio. I do not have Realtek HD Audio Manager. Can someone please help me? I've been at this all day.
