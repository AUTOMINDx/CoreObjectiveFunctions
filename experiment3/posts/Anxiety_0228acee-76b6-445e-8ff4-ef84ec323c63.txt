After 7 intense years of studying, I got my first job offer!
I’m so happy to share that I got my first job offer after 7 years and 3 masters. As a person with anxiety, it was sometimes really hard to endure all the stress but I succeeded to be among the best of the class. I got a really good job offer for one of the best law firms in my country yesterday which makes me so proud. I’m so glad that I didn’t let my anxiety ruin my ambitions. If I can do it, you can all do it!
