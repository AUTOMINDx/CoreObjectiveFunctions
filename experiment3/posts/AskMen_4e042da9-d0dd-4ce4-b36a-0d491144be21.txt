How would you feel if your partner did not want to take your last name if/when you got married?
Edit: I appreciate everyone’s responses to this. It’s given me a different perspective and I think everyone’s reasoning behind their own preference is valid. It’s interesting to see the differences in cultural traditions as well. I think all that really matters is that two people can come to an agreement and continue to love each other.
