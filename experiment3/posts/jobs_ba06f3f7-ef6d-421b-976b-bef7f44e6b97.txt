I feel every job I have I’m not interested at all, unlike my coworkers
Just recently got a new job. Pay is better and hours are better than previous job. I have a sense that everyone there is way more invested and interested in the job/it’s processes and I just can’t seem to give a single care. It’s like this at every I’ve had. I’m very ADHD so just focusing in general is quite difficult if I don’t care about what I’m engaged in.

To me, it seems like a sad state to be so involved and dedicated to your job that you don’t have much of a life outside of the building.

Anyone else agree?
