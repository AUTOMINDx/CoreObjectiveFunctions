Dating a virgin
So my (25m) girlfriend (20f) is a virgin. It’s partially based on a religious upbringing and fears of pregnancy. She talks about doing other sexual things but we never have and it’s been almost 4 months now. The age difference doesn’t really help either because I’ve grown accustomed to certain things in relationships and I’m basically her first boyfriend. I’ve never been with a virgin before and I don’t know how to go about it. Every time I try and test the waters she seems to like it and want to continue but she always cuts it off, which I respect but well, idk it just kinda kills me

I like her a lot and I don’t want to pressure her and I’ve been honest about this but it’s getting to a point where I feel unsatisfied as physical intimacy is important to me, not everything, but not having it at all really messes with my self confidence. 

Basically I feel like I’m in the “friend zone” in my own relationship, especially now that the honeymoon phase is pretty much over. I’m finding it harder to hold out hope for our relationship to evolve into anything physical. And I feel like it makes other smaller issues in our relationship that much more difficult to deal with. 

I’m really on the line about what to do
