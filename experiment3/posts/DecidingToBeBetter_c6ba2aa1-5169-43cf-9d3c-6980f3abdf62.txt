I will no longer feel sorry for myself, because I am resilient, powerful and beautiful. So are you.
I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself. I have tried doing this many times but failed, part of the learning I guess. This time I know _I am resilient, powerful and beautiful_. I won't feel sorry for myself any longer. I invite you all to do the same. Let's live and prosper.
