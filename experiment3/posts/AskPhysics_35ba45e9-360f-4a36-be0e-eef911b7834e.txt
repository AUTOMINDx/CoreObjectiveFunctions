How dangerous is tritium?
I have several tritium vials ive bought online, ive also given some to family and friends

I found out my friend threw his out because he was afraid of it.

Does anyone know the danger levels of tritium compared to something like sunlight?

Im talking about when it is contained and isnt eaten or inhaled
