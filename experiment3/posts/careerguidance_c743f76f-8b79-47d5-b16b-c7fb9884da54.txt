New job- would it be a red flag to employers if I'm applying for jobs after 5 months? Wanting remote and a more established team.
I've been in the job for 5 months. I was excited to continue state benefits and get my foot in the door at this employer. 

Lesson learned. If it's a new position on a small, overworked team that's growing and changing ..proceed with caution unless they blow you away on the interview. 

It's not insufferable. The people are nice, I have the potential to pick up some great resume builders. My coworker was hired at the same time and she's awesome. However, I won't get into all the details on why I don't feel that this is a great fit, but I feel so disengaged, and our supervisor seems overworked, stressed out, not used to being a supervisor, and our one-on-ones constantly get cancelled because she's too busy.

My coworker feels the exact same way as I do, and in fact was asked to apply for a position with her old employer. She shared this with me and I would be surprised if she hasn't done so. 

I was at my old employer for ~4.5 years and was promoted in that time as well. I don't have "job hopping" on my resume. 

I'm also commuting ~45 minutes each way to this job, only to twiddle my thumbs alongside my coworker. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the commute or being back in an office, but was excited enough to give it a shot. I now realize I really want to be remote and at home with my dogs. 

Should I tough it out or start job searching? How do you onboard and start working 100% remote from the get go, but still feel engaged and part of the team?
