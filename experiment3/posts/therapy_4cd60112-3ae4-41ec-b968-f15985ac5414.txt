$200 for 50 minute session?
I think I found the right therapist but he costs $200 for a 50 minute session. I have Kaiser insurance but heard that it takes a lot of time to find a therapist, much more time finding a therapist that you can connect with. Is $200 too expensive for therapy or is that the right range?
