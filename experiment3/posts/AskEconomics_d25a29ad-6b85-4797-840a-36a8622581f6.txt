Do patent laws really help innovation?
I understand that a single company has more incentive to innovate if competitors can't use its innovation, but without patent laws, this technology would be adopted (virtually) universally, and every single decentralized innovation would be incorporated by other companies, something like the policentricity concept of science of Michael Polanyi.

Do models used to calculate the net effect of patent laws take into account the innovation that did not happen because the technology was monopolized? How is it measured?
