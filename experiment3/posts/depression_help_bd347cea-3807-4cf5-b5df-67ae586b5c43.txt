Its getting really bad again
I'm noticing the overwhelming bad feelings start to bubble up inside again. This is a terrible time to have to deal with this right now. I have family stuff, work stuff and these depressive episodes keep getting worse. I actually thought i made progress and was doing better but no, not even a little. I don't know if i can grit my teeth and bare through more of these.
I'm just so afraid and tired.
