My ex contacted my therapist.
I broke up with my ex almost nine months ago. Long story short, he was emotionally and mentally abusive and a narcissist. The break up was tough, but I’ve moved on and I’m much happier. I started seeing my therapist a few months before we broke up. I always hated the concept of therapy, but she’s the only therapist I’ve been able to really connect with. During my last session she let me know that my ex had emailed her with screenshots of some of our text exchanges and an extremely long message. She said she didn’t read most of it and told him that it was unethical/illegal for her to respond to any of his questions and to take care. 

My therapist was concerned that this would harm our therapeutic relationship if I didn’t trust that she didn’t share anything. I completely trust her. But the fact that it could have done harm, makes me incredibly mad. Therapy has been so helpful to me and I’m happy to have found a therapist I’m comfortable with. I feel so violated and angry. I’m unsure if I’m overreacting, but to hear that made me feel completely unsafe.

Edit for clarification: I’m not upset with my therapist. She’s amazing and I don’t think I could have asked for more in how she handled it. I’m upset with my ex for attempting to make therapy an unsafe space for me.
