I'm assuming there a lot of crossover between this sub and the sub for your subdiscipline. Do all the "disciplinary" subs get obvious undergrads looking for homework/quiz answers, or just social sicence?
The number of questions that are obvious homework/quiz questions from undergrads always seems to go up this time of year (and the end of April).  Is it a social science problem (cause we write in text;  I can't imagine what trying to type a complex formula (double integrations anyone?) is like here) or do all subs for academic disciplines have this problem?
