I’m so tired of the dumb dating advice that’s available here
“Just be passionate and happy” “just be yourself” “just be confident”. All of this will always come second to physical attraction. It’s a bitter pill to swallow I know but the sooner you do it the better. For the vast majority of people. No amount of personality will make you attractive if you’re fat and ugly. The reason she don’t like you is because she doesn’t find you attractive. It’s that simple. I’ve seen way too many upvotes on posts with terrible advice. It’s like a point system. Nobody is going to dock you if you have a great body and a good job but they will if you don’t and for the vast majority of people having a good body and job is the minimum requirement. Furthermore when you’re physically attractive it ups your confidence a lot, thereby making your personality attractive as well. 

This is probably going to get downvoted but I hope this at least reaches people new to dating who are wondering why they suck. Go to the gym, take care of your skin, get a decent job and talk to women. Easier said than done I know, but nothing of value is ever given freely.
