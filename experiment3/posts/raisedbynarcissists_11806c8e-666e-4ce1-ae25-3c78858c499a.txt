Did Anyone Else Have an NParent that was Incapable of Apologizing Normally?
On the rare occasions my N decided to apologize to me, it was always framed as: "I'm sorry that /you/ felt that way."

However, I was always expected to kow-tow for even the slightest infraction.

Edit: Thank you for the award, kind stranger!
