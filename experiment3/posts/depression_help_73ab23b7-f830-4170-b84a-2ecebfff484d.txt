Why are all online resources useless?
I don’t know if it’s just me, but every time I try to look something up related to depression or anxiety I wind up on some Buzzfeed like article that provides no actionable solutions. 

Today’s been a rough one for me - my depression is in full force trying to keep me down. I did the whole “self-care” thing. I took a long walk with my pups, had a nice lunch, made some cookies, listened to a podcast that I love, and even shared my feelings with my partner.

Nothing worked today.

That’s just how thing play out sometimes, and I understand that, but I’m just looking for that “next thing” that I can try. I turned to Google to see what I could find and every result seemed to tell me what I’m doing wrong but failed to provide any solutions. It’s just so frustrating. 

I guess this is just a rant now, but if anyone has any advice or kind words I’ll take them.
