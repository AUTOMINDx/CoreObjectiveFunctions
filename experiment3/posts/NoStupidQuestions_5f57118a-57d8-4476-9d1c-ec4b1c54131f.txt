I haven't smoked for 10 days. I stopped cold turkey. I really want a cigarette, like REALLY want 1. It's been very difficult today, the craving hasn't let me concentrate on my work for over 1 hour. I'm tempted to go buy a packet and take 1 cig and give the rest to a homeless. Why shouldn't I do it?
