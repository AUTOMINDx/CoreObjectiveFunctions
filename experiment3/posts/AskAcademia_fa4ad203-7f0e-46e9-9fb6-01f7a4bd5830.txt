If the deadline for abstract submission is December 15th, does that include or exclude the 15th?
I have an abstract for a large conference due tomorrow (or so I thought), but a fellow researcher interpreted the deadline of December 15th as 'submit on 14th at the latest'. I'm slightly panicking now, how would you interpret this deadline? Twice on the site it says 'deadline: December 15th', once it says 'until December 15th' and once it says submission is open 'between Oktober 1st and December 15th'. 

My field is linguistics and the conference is in Germany, if that helps.

EDIT: I handed it in on the 15th, the submission form was still open and it all seemed fine. Thanks for the replies everyone!
