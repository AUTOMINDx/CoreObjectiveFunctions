/r/philosophy Open Discussion Thread | December 13, 2021
Welcome to this week's Open Discussion Thread. This thread is a place for
posts/comments which are related to philosophy but wouldn't necessarily meet
our [posting rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/rules) (especially
posting rule 2).  For example, these threads are great places for:

* Arguments that aren't substantive enough to meet PR2.

* Open discussion about philosophy, e.g. who your favourite philosopher
  is, what you are currently reading

* Philosophical questions. Please note that /r/askphilosophy is a great
  resource for questions and if you are looking for moderated answers we
  suggest you ask there.

This thread is **not** a completely open discussion! Any posts not relating to
philosophy will be removed. Please keep comments related to philosophy, and
expect low-effort comments to be removed. All of our normal commenting rules
are still in place for these threads, although we will be more lenient with
regards to commenting rule 2.
