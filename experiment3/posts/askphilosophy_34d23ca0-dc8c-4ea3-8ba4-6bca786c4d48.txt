The concept of "fake nostalgia"
Mark Fisher speaks of "a culture that is excessively nostalgic, given over to retrospection, incapable of generating any authentic novelty." (Mark Fisher, *Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?* (Winchester: Zero Books, 2010), 26.) His notion of the regression into the past is explored as *nostalgia.* 

Are there any philosophers who wrote on nostalgia of past events that never actually occurred or is this a new concept?
