Gross odd question about Poop
Ok, this may be a really far out there question maybe I’m the only weirdo to wonder. Why is your butt bad at measuring poop? What I mean is sometimes you’ll poop for like five minutes and it feels like you’re pooping out a bus for one small turd and other times you’ll sit one and feel like you plopped out a cherry sized turd just to find a foot long turd in the toilet.
