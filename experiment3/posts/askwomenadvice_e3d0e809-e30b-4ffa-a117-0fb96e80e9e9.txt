Should I break up with boyfriend over financial differences?
I’ve been seeing this guy for about a month and our financial differences have become apparent.

I have more money than him and it kinda makes me uncomfortable. For financial context, he couldn’t afford a birthday present for me while I was able to give him one. We’ve already been unable to go out to restaurants/movies/ other traditional date places due to financial constraints. I’m wondering how other women feel/felt about a similar predicament? I’m not crazy rich or anything. Pretty average for my area. He’s a nice guy, but again, we’ve only been dating for a month so I don’t know him on a deeper level.

Is it selfish to feel uncomfortable/want someone of a similar financial status? I worry that our differences would lead to relationship issues down the road. Or should I continue the relationship with these potential doubts? Thank you guys
