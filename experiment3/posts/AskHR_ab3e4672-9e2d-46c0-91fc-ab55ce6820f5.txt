[AU] A senior staff member under my supervision keeps reporting me to HR
Spurious complaints are made over minor perceived slights. Accusations of bullying and harassment over questions seeking information. I cant avoid engagement because Im  accountable for the work they do. 

Phone conversations are not an option. Emails are terse on both sides. How do I engage over legitimate work issues while protecting myself from such allegations?
