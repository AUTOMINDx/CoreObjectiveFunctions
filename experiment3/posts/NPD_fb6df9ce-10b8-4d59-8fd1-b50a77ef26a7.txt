I hate being alone
I feel like I go crazy when I'm alone. I recently noticed that I subconsciously always act like there are people around me when I'm alone; I imagine conversations, tell jokes to myself while imagining people laughing...but after a while, my imagined audience's applause doesn't suffice anymore and I feel like I start to go insane. I just feel completely empty and depressed when there is nobody to affirm me, sometimes I even start to dissociate. Does anybody else know this? Or am I nuts?
