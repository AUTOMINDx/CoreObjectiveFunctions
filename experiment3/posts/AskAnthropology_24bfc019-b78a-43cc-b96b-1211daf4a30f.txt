How common are grandmothers found as important figures in many cultures around the world, and why not grandfathers?
My husband is from Russia and we were making jokes about "Babushka". Later, we were watching Encanto which is about a matriarchal leader. It made me think of our own families and how my grandmother was such a key part of family get-togethers and how difficult it is to stay together without her here.

It makes me wonder about the role of a grandmother in the societies around the world. How common are grandmothers seen as these matriarchal leaders? Why are they often represented over grandfathers? Do they show up over and over again or am I just crazy???

I guess I'm wanting to know if it's common, and if it is, if there are any interesting or cool facts about man kind's relationship with their grandparents.
