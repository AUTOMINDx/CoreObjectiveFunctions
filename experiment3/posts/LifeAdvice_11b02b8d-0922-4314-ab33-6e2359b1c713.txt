no idea what to do in my 20s
im almost a year into my 20s yet i still don’t know what to do, my parents is still dictating me like I’m 16. i know i need to find a job in my early 20s, i don’t care if i work in McDonalds or burger king but my parents wont let me even if i got an offer from a multi million dollar IT company (exaggerated). the pandemic is fucking up my life in its entirety, online classes are a big heavy burden because i easily get distracted and i fail my classes. 

i tried finding part times that are in line with my major but they all require certifications which are very expensive in SEA especially in Indonesia. i tried fixing my grades but they all overwhelms me and i ended up taking a break and proceed to forget about it. 

pandemic brought my dad’s restaurant to its knees and we barely make ends meet. i lost my own room because of expensive electricity and now everyone is embarrassing me when i’m in class and once i got shouted while doing my presentation making me losing it even more

the 3rd paragraph is the reason why i wanted to take part time jobs, but they simply wont let me as they keep telling me “you dont need to, we (parents) still can handle it”

im turning 21 next year and im hoping to pull my shit together, because ive suffered much from my suicide attempts.

but i meed help of things i should do in my 20s and how i can convince my parents to let me find a job

p.s sorry for the tangled sentences, im so close to losing it i dont even care
