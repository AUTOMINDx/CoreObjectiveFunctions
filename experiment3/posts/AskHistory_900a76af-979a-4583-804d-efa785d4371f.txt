Looking for a Djengis Khan story I heard about many years ago.
So the story goes something like this: 
Djengis Khan and his mongols was about to go to war with China (I think it was) . But instead of sending his army there as a first move he sent one single messenger to their gates. 
The mongolian messenger knocked at their gates and when the chinese opened up the mongolian man without saying a single word, took up a knife and cuts his own throat. 
After that China surrender to Djengis Khan and his Empire out of fear how much power Djengis had over his own people and what lenght they was ready to go for him. 

Have anyone ever heard about this story before? I canâ€™t find it when I search for it. 
And If anyone can direct me where I can find it it would be highly appreciated!
