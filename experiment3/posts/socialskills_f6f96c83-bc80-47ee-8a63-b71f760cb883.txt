My CEO always tells me to speak up in meetings and itâ€™s really starting to piss me off.
Sometimes I feel like sheâ€™s just picking on me because Iâ€™m young. Iâ€™m 22 sitting at a table with mostly 35-50 year olds. I am a soft-spoken person, but Iâ€™m not shy and I try my best to speak up during meetings. Everytime I have a meeting with her and other people, even if she is on zoom and I am in the office, she always tells me to speak up in front of everybody and embarrasses me. In my ears I literally feel like Iâ€™m screaming and she still mentions it. It also makes me feel awkward and then Iâ€™d just rather not talk the whole time instead. 

In most situations and other jobs Iâ€™ve had, no one has mentioned it before and Iâ€™m usually told I come across as pretty confident. I just donâ€™t know what to do at this point, I honestly want to quit because of her personality.

Edit: Iâ€™d also like to clarify that Iâ€™m a girl, if that changes anything. My voice is naturally high pitch, idk how to deepen it without sounding funny ðŸ˜†
