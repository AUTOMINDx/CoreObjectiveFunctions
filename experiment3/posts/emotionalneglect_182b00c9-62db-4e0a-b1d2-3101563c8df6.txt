I think I might be getting rid of some of my maladaptive behaviors
I was raised in an environment where all of my mistakes were punished and I got no sympathy for them - it was crushing especially with ADHD. As a result my coping mechanism was to get cagey and defensive over every mistake I make. Today I made a mistake and I apologized for it - no impulsive lying, no "I'm sorry, but...", no just leaving it alone and hoping it never gets brought up again.


I know it's a small victory but I still want to make note of it.
