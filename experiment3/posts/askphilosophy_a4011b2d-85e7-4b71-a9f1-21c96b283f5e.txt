Would Kant consider abortion moral?
Hi everyone. In class, we discussed the theory of Kant (categorical imperative). I think I understood the theory behind it but I was just wondering if Kant would consider abortion moral. So maybe you could explain to me how Kant would argue in this case and if he would consider abortion moral.
