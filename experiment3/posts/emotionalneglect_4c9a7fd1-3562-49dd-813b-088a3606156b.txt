One of the only stories I have from my infancy.
My mom told me once. When her and my bio dad were still together, when I was a newborn, she would leave me with him while she worked and was out of the house (take this with a grain of salt, I know she was guilty of this too) and one day she told me she'd come back after 18 hours and saw that I was still in my crib while my bio dad was out of the house fishing. I was left there in my own shit, and she said I was so lucky she came home when she did, because there was a huge scorpion in my crib who probably was going to kill me.

Well,

I honestly would like to think that the scorpion heard me suffering and came to comfort me. I like the idea of baby me with a scorpion watching over me, looking at me with it's little eyes or chasing off spiders. The scorpion never tried to kill me, but my mother later would (actively, not just passively with extreme neglect). 

Idk, maybe this is the wrong sub to post this but I just wanted to share how I like to recontextusloze one of the only stories I have of my babyhood.
