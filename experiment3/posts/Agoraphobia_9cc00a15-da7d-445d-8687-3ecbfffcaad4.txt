I drove for an hour today!!!
For a driving class which made it extremely scary &amp; it was all on main roads, I was anxious about it all day because it was the farthest I’d ever been “alone” (without a security person) anyway I was so focused on driving that it kept me calm. A year ago I was crying because I thought I wasn’t going to be able to get through my driving courses, I still have 1/3 to go and more scary classes but still.
