Where should I start if I am interested to read Nietzche?
I have not properly studied philosophy but wish to begin reading up on my own. I will likely be pursuing philosophy in university in the future.

Edit: Thank you to all those that have provided fantastic responses👍 I have certainly learnt a lot
