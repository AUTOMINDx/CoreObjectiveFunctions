Never ending expectation of perpetual childhood?
Does anyone else’s active-alcoholic parent seem to not grasp that childhood ends as kids grow into adults? I’m trying to make this make sense to myself as a write this because it’s really stressing me out today, so bare with me…

My mom is regularly distraught by the fact that none of “the families kids” (meaning myself, 32, and my 25+ year old cousins) do the things we did as kids. She gets upset that we all don’t come together (as adults, not with children, from all over the US) to do big holiday events at my grandmas (also her residence because she lives there as well). That’s a poor example of how extensive her distortion is, but it’s hard for me to explain.

Like, it’s as if she truly to her core, expects and believes that the child/teenager I was at 14, mentally and physically, should be who I am now. She shares this same distortion with all of my cousins, etc. That’s the best way I can think to describe it 🙄

All my aunts, uncles etc all traveled the typical route of, as we grew, understanding that the lot of us are adults now, most with our own families, and busy lives. Not her.

Anyway, is there anyone else out here who experiences this or something similar? Is there a phrase or term I can research for what the hell mental block this is? Is it even a thing?
