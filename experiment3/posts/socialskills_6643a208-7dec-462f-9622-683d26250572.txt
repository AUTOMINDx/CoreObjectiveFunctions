Comfortable with being quiet
No idea if this is the right place to post, apologies if its not.
I'm a quiet person and for ages I felt like there was a pressure to talk in social settings. However, recently I've started to realise I'm accepting myself more, and realising I genuinely don't mind hardly talking. Maybe it's because I have nothing to say but I don't worry about having to force myself to talk when I don't want to or care to. Is it normal to be happy with other people talking around you but only listening/participating now and again? I just don't feel the need to talk but not in a depressed way, it's in a content way.
