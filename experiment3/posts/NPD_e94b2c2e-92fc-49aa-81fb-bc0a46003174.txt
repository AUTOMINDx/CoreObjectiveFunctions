I think an NPD activist I follow passed away and I feel weird and numb
So it turns out, she is alive. She attempted suicide or was stopped before attempting suicide. I still feel kind of numb, but I'm glad she's still here.

I deleted all the text so that new readers don't have to scroll all the way to the bottom to find out she's still alive.
