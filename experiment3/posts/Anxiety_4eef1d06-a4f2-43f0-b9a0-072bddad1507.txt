I did something today.
I saw a beautiful woman and I approached her. I asked her for her number and she smiled at me and told me I’m sorry, I’m married. I usually have a load of anxiety but today, I just said fuck it, overcame it and did it. I might’ve gotten rejected but that doesn’t mean their won’t be other opportunities to meet other women.
