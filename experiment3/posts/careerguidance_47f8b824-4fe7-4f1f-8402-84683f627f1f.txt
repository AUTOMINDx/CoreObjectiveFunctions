Is it normal to not want to progress past "intermediate" level of software development?
I've seen time and time again, of senior developers over me being asked to work longer hours. I myself, find my personal time extremely valuable. I am the kind who will work hard while I'm there, but refuse to work a minute past my obligated time. I find that it's more common to ask senior developers to put in time, or at least pressure them. I just want to collect my 110k or so salary and work my 40 hours. Is this normal? And if not, why do you think it's worth working more than 40 hours?
