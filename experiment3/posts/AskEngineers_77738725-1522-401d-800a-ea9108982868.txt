Doing part time masters while balancing full time work
Question to whoever has done or doing a part time masters degree while balancing full time work, how did you do it?

I want to start my masters but I always keep worrying what if I can’t manage all of it? Have to complete HWs, assignments, exams on time. I don’t have time or will have energy to do anything after coming back from work, let alone study for courses.

Do you study everyday after coming from work or few hours on weekends would be enough?

Thanks!
