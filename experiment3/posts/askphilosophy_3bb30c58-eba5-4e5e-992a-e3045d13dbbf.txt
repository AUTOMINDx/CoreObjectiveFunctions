How can we believe anything?
I am a beginner when it comes to philosophy and this question bothers me a lot. Lemme give an example: 
We believe the news right? I am not talking about political news (since many people have different opinions on that sort of stuff) but rather I am talking about news in general. Like a news report on a flood or tsunami for example. Now how can I know for sure that the events described in the news report have actually occured and are not just lies since I've not seen the tsunami myself to verify it. 
Same goes with a lot of things. Take flat earth for example ( I am not a flat earther but hear me out). Most people have not experimentally verified that the earth is round. They just know it from news or other media and so they believe it. Most of us haven't conducted experiments to test whether the earth is round or flat. So how can we be so sure to believe it. 
This creates a lot of problems. I can verify the roundness of earth by conducting experiments. I can probably verify the tsunami in Japan if I visit Japan. But how can I verify everything I read? Every belief I hold? It's impossible and would take an entire lifetime? 

Is there a solution to this problem? Maybe some philosophical book I can read on this? I am a total noob when it comes to this.
