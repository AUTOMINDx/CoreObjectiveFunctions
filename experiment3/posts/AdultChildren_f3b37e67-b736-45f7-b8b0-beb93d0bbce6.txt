I held a boundary today
So I’m at a point where I thankfully have an okay relationship with both of my parents, one of who is a recovered alcoholic and has been sober for over a decade now, and the other (mom) who struggles with sobriety but hasn’t gotten drunk around me in a while. Unfortunately today mom decided to get drunk at an event we were at together and once I realized I got upset with her and said that I wasn’t cool with this. But after that I calmed down and made a decision that since she violated my boundary about not feeling comfortable being around her if she was drinking, I would end my stay with her early. 

So I drove her home and packed up my bags and said that I was going to head out for the evening but we could maybe meet tomorrow at some point (because I still had a good day with her before then and I still did want to see her). This was really difficult, I was scared the whole time and I kept going back and forth in my head wondering if I was being dramatic if I just left. But I somehow did it! I held my boundary and I didn’t yell or try to fight with her, I didn’t give in due to shame. I didn’t respond to her lashing out. I felt really good about how I handled it.

I still am very early on in my recovery and have so much to work on. But I just wanted to share that because I am proud of myself.
