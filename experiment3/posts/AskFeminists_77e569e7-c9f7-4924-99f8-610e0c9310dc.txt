The Loki TV series is one of the first superhero shows to have a male lead be easily beaten up by and subservient to female characters, who are not bound by having to respect or be intimidated by him. Do you think such a liberal portrayal of women played a part in the backlash the show generated?
For those that haven’t seen it, the show isn’t afraid to have women beat Loki up in comedic:

And even slightly degrading manners:

He’s also quite subservient in the relationship he develops throughout the show where although he is pretty much head over heels in love with the woman he meets, she’s more interested in using him for her overarching goal of this big revenge mission, a role typically given to men. Instead of being quiet and submissive, she’s not afraid to put him down:

To tell him to shut up:

And in the end when they have the big fight, she wins:

Of course, the show has independently received a good deal of backlash, from the director being abused ie https://twitter.com/iamkateherron/status/1419988090849005579 (Marvel later confirmed she wouldn’t be returning for Season 2) to the lead writer being indirectly threatened with murder https://twitter.com/moresgeek/status/1417315525026357248 (he’s rumored to have a much smaller role in season 2) to people on 4Chan talking about burning the studio down to the show losing over half a million viewers across its 6 episode first season and more.

Do you think there’s a correlation?
