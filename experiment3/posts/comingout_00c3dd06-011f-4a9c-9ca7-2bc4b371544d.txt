I came out to him, he came out to me
I came out recently to a friend when working at a Comic Con a few months ago. Whilst I taking a look around I found a stall selling pin badges with pictures of dice and in various pride flag colour schemes. I bought myself a bi badge and wore it on my uniform. Back at my stall I never made any reference to it until an hour later a friend asked me where I got it. He went off and came back wearing a pan badge.

He later said that it was a great subtle way of doing it so he decided to do the same. Turns out we came out to each other.
