For those with invisible illness(es): how do you describe an illness with no visible symptoms to others?
Is there a metaphor or analogy you use to describe your illness or how you feel to someone who may be less empathetic and not understand how your condition is very real? Someone once described themselves as being a bad apple (shiny and pristine on the outside, rotten on the inside). Does anyone have anything better to add? I have described the way I feel as my joints being on fire.
