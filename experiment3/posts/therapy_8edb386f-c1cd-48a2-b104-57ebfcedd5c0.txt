Christmas sucks
My childhood was absolute shit. I have been able to heal from the majority of the trauma, except for Christmas.  My parents ruined it for me. And I have worked my ass off making sure my children had wonderful Christmas memories.  And even those were shit for me. I'm in my thoughts 40s and ots something I cannot get past. I absolutely hate the day and wish I lived in a world that it didn't exist in.
