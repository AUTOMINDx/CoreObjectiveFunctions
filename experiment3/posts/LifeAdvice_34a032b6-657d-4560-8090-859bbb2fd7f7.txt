Moving to Denver from LA for more money
Hi,

I'm in my early 30s and have been offered a job in Denver that's in the 6 figures. I have heard Denver isn't very diverse and since I'm a Hispanic living in L.A. I get the feeling the change would be big.

I haven't received my bachelors yet since Im doing community college right now but I'd like to resume schooling when arriving to Denver. I'm making 60k a year in L.A. but I feel moving to Denver for twice that amount would be worth it. 

Am I crazy for wanting to do this? I have never lived anywhere else and I'm born and raised in L.A.

I would love some insight from anyone regarding this, thanks for your time.
