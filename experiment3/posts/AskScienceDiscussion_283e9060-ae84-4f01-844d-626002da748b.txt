From an epidemiological perspective, is there a scenario where Covid19 always remains a pandemic, and never becomes endemic? If yes, what sort of public health policies would be needed to effectively manage that scenario?
**EDIT: Sorry I meant to write "epidemic" but it got (incorrectly) autocorrected to "endemic". Thanks so much for letting me know** u/clearlystyle!

Genuinely curious
