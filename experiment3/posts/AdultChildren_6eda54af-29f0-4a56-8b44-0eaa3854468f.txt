I finally stood up for myself
I finally stood up to my roommate who has been treating me like crap for the last 2 months.

I never realized how non-confrontational I was until now. My roommate broke into my room to take some stuff that was being stored (it's a complicated situation). This was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Since I moved in he has been triggering me with how much he acts like my alcoholic father, and I let myself be a doormat because that's how I was with my dad. Setting boundaries never worked with my dad, it just lead to reactions from teasing to full on arguments, and nothing changed.

And it was the same way with my roommate, and he was acting. I knew how the conversations would go, and knew it wouldn't change his behavior, so I always was thinking "What's the point?" But, today was different. I knew what he was going to say, I knew it wasn't going to change his mind or his treatment of me, but I stood up for myself. I finally stood my ground, laid out my boundary, and even though the conversation did go exactly how I knew it would. He responded almost word for word how I expected him to. But, even when he tried to push my buttons, and he was aiming for the right ones, I stayed calm. I was mature, I was respectful, and I didn't react.

And I'm so proud of myself. It's a small step, but it's a fucking step forward and I'm so proud.
