[Avatar] Does Bumi personally pass judgement on every single crime that goes on in Omashu?
Aang and his gang were merely a bunch of kids messing around but that seemed to warrant the judgement of the head of state.

Also bear in the mind that Bumi did not know it was the Avatar until he saw Aang's face.
