Bloodwork aftermath
So, today was a semi success for lack of a better word lol.

Despite my brain doing everything in it's power to get me to not go i went anyway  
Almost turned back a few times but i got it over with.

Wish i could say everything went smoothly. But, unfortunately i did hit some pretty big roadblocks. It was definitely stressful. Especially on the way there. Surprisingly enough. Actually getting the blood draw was the least stressful part of it. The anticipation is definitely what gets me more than anything.

For some reason i can never concentrate on keeping myself calm, i find it difficult to ground myself in the thick of things. I'm guessing it was particularly bad since it was my first stressful outing in awhile. The doctor was very kind thoug.

But regardless of all that, i did go. Despite being stressed i did make the first step towards some kind of recovery. But i'm unsure of what to do next, i'm very shy, always have been. Before this, before i even had GAD. So i always have trouble speaking to people about my anxiety and on ways how to improve myself.

Some of you mentioned therapy in my last post, and by the way thanks for all your comments. Despite my lukewarm performance at the clinic you guys were all very helpful, if it weren't for you guys i don't know if i would've gone. Anyway, some of you mentioned therapy. I've read about exposure therapy a little while before the appointment, really regret not trying it before it was too late.
