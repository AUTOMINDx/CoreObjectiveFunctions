Did anyone find 2021 harder than 2020 (in the context of the pandemic)?
At the beginning of the pandemic, I went into survival mode (which I happen to have good training for!). I’m also an introvert and don’t like leaving the house so aside from the first few weeks of fear about the world being ridden with disease, I felt okay. It felt like everyone around me was struggling so I went into “hold it together” mode. 

But as the pandemic dragged on, and we were slowly expected to resume “normal life,” I felt myself growing increasingly depressed. Everything feels harder now. I had many painful realizations during all those alone months.

DAE relate?
