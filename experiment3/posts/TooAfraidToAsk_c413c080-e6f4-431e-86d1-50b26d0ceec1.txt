Is there anything people in the USA are not desensitized to?
I could list a long rant but honestly

It seems like there's nothing left people in the USA aren't desensitized to

Mass shooting, school shootings, political instability, company theatrics and bs, protests just another day

Seems the only shock left people would have left that have yet to experience are

Car bombs, mass insurgency, nuclear bomb going off. 

Maybe just me but anything left people aren't desensitized to as violence and killing others seems to be a everyday mundane affair.
