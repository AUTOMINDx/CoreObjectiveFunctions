A small victory
I hung out with a friend today.

I’ve been able to keep my agoraphobia in check enough to take care of what I really, really need to do (which in itself is a win)…
But today I hung out with a friend for the first time in two years! I didn’t even realize until they left, but I’m really proud of myself for not making an excuse and just chatting with them over the phone instead.
