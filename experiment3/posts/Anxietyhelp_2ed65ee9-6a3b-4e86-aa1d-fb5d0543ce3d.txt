Internship/Work Anxiety
Hi, i’m about to start internship next year, seem to be having trouble with anxiety and panic attacks.

Are there any suggestions or advice for suffering panic attacks at the workplace? 

I have ordered a subtle fidget ring (check out impulse modern on instagram) for just casual use,,, but idk how to deal with heart palpitations.

Only thing that works so far is a weighted blanket and meds…

Will be interning in an architecture firm soon. Wish me lots of luck.
