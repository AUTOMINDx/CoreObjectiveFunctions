What do I do?
I’m interviewing for a position that I feel is perfect for me! The interviewer seems pretty happy too and I have been asked back for a 5th and final interview. The job is working in building client relationships. I am called to the job but there is one problem; I have been a PT worker for the last 4 years to mother my children and I can’t fathom putting my infant in daycare at the height of a Covid pandemic. Even with this job I can’t afford full time nanny care. My wife works from home 2 days a week and while we need the money as we live month to month right now. I am hoping to propose a 50% work from home plan if offered the job… what are my chances and if they say no… what do I do? 

The job was previously held (at some point) by a part timer but they are not in a hurry as they want the right fit.

I want to be the right fit!
