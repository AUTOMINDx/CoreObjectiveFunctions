Why does so much of Reddit hate religion?
I don't mean the people that just say they don't like Christians or something, I mean the people that say stuff like "wow, look at these absolute idiots believing in fairy tales. What a bunch of children", or will actively 

I'm agnostic myself, so I'm not personally insulted or anything, but this seems so overkill, why is there any need to be so vehemently opposed to someone else's beliefs right out the gates? I of course would understand more if someone has been personally wronged by someone using religion as a reason to be a piece of shit (and I'm well aware that there are plenty of people like that) but many of these people just seem like they want to antagonize religion because they disagree with it.
