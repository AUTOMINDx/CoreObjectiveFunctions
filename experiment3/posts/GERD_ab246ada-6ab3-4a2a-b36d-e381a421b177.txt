How long have you been on a ppi?
Hi, I recently had a endoscopy done and I was placed back on Omeprazole 20mg in the morning and at night. I've been on and off Omeprazole for 3 years and I'm scared about the serious side effects from long term use. I have a 4cm sliding hiatal hernia which causes issues.
