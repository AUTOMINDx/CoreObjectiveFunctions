Guys, would you allow your gf dance/grind on another guy at the club.
There is a club I go to almost every weekend. I've seen and met people and see them on a regular basis. Anyways I see a couple that dances often (one of them works there) Anyways, I was walking around to find a friend. The gf grabs my hand and she starts dancing/grinding up on me. It was enjoyable, her bf was clearly watching her up against me. I kept thinking about how her bf feels about this. Apparently, he didn't mind it.

How would you feel about watching your gf grind up on another guy?
