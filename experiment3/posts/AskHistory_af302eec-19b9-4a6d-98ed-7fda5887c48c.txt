What about cannibalism during European famines ?
Hi ! 

I heard that during European famines (mostly XIth century) there were cases of famine where people would literally eat, not only the poorest, but their own children as well ! 

Unfortunately, I canâ€™t find any reliable sources to confirm or deny it. 

Do you have any clues ?
