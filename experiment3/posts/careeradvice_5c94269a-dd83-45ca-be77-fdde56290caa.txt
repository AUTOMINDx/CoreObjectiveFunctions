Is it weird to go back to a company that laid you off less than two years ago?
I used to work for a multi billion dollar apparel company for a large scale transformation project. Company was on a rise before the pandemic, but then during the pandemic,they laid off 15% of their global corporate workforce and I was one of them. My project scaled down at that time too. But after that, the company did really well in the last year and that program I worked in scaled up even more than pre-pandemic level. They realized they're not going to be able to move ahead efficiently with consultants, they need in house employees to drive things, so my former colleague reached out to me to ask if I'd be interested in considering a return. 

Would it be weird to go back to that company? 
Personally, if they give me a higher salary than my current job I wouldn't care since I liked their vision for the role. 
Would others feel awkward being around another team member they'd laid off?
