Can you try too hard at therapy?
My therapist made a few comments in my most recent session that I am trying too hard or pushing too hard in therapy and that I need to go easier. I took this as criticism that landed quite hard and I feel upset with my therapist, and like it made me lose hope that therapy could help me. So my question is can you try too hard at therapy? And if so, how do you try to try less..?
