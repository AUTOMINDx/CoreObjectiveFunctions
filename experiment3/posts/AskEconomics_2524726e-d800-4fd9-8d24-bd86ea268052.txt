if 35-80% of US dollars were printed in 2020, why is inflation ‘only’ at 6.8%?
i’ve seen a bunch of different figures for how much the money supply rose in 2020, but surely if there was a 35% increase in the money supply there’d be an increase of 35% inflation? is that not what the fisher equation shows?
