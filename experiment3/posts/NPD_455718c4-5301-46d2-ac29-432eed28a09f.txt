I'm a good person. I'm a goddamn communal
I have to write it down so that I can remember. I need to stop having different opinions about myself everyday.

Taking the whole of me into account, I'm a good person -- and not a criminal, not an abuser, not a monster, not a sociopath.

And I'm not forgetting things here. I'm not trying to make up excuses nor rationalize mistakes of the past. I fucked up a lot.

Firstly, each time I fucked up - it was mostly self-sabotaging. I'd damage or get out of relations with people who were beneficial to me -- like friends, who are necessary for the sake of good mental health. It's obvious that I did not want to work against my own self-interest and I hated myself for ruining things.

**We can't blame the disorder for our actions, but only disordered people do self-sabotaging things compulsively.**

Secondly, I have to be realistic and think in terms of statistics. I "narc abused" maybe one or two people. In my defense, I also contributed a lot to their lives. I immediately began asking the question "why am I sometimes going batshit crazy". Kinda became conscious and avoided socializing for years.

**I did almost nothing that I could get arrested for. No crime that would have an impact on others or would be considered "immoral".** Never beat anyone, never threatened, never blackmailed. Intimidating someone is another story, but only in retaliation or self-defense. Drug abuse does not count.

Things like tax-evasion are in the grey area, but struggling to make ends meet is a mitigating circumstance. And it's the goddamn cultural norm.

I made hopes for some people. I considered them "temporary" friends. Disappointed or abandoned them. That's the thing that pisses me off about myself. From another perspective, I entertained them for a few months.

I looked at people as objects. Fuck me for having no empathy. I sometimes fuck up because logical thinking is not the best way to approach humans.

**I make up for the lack of empathy by thinking. I do "checks" and heuristics.**

It fucks me up sometimes. In the past, I tried to help someone. I knew that they might get pissed off by what I was about to do. But those things are hard to process for me, so I resorted to rational thinking. If I do what I want to do, will I cause them any damages or loss? Would I be considered strange or weird? No, so they shouldn't get angry. Well, guess what - they got angry as fuck. 

**All in all, Iâ€™m not a bad guy. Maybe not amiable. Definitely not malignant.**
