How do you handle feeling touch deprived?
I've been single for 3 years now and I hate it! The hardest part for me and probably a huge reason to why I'm struggling so much right now is touch deprivation. I can't express how badly I just want someone to wrap their arms around me and just hold me for a bit. It's getting really bad, I'm either breaking down just thinking about it or I'm considering finding a hook up just for some human connection, but that's just not me. 

How do I deal with this?

Edit: Can people stop DMing me telling me I'm selfish or lucky because at least I've been in a relationship before and it's only been 3 years. Luck has nothing to do with it. I'm sorry you're also struggling but please don't invalidate other peoples' emotions.

Edit 2: all your responses both make me feel sad but also less alone. At least we understand each other ü•∫ I'll purchase a weighted blanket as recommended after Christmas cos.. Funds ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Edit 3: Thank you so much to the kind soul who gifted me a weighted blanket and for all the lovely comments/message. You have no idea how grateful I am ‚ù§
