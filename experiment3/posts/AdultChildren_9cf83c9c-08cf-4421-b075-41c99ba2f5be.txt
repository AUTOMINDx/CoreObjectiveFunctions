Anyone else fall into the “dysfunctional parents” category?
My parents didn’t drink because it was against my childhood religion. But they were highly dysfunctional in so many ways. Most people on this sub post about alcoholic parents, so I wanted to see if anyone else falls into the dysfunctional parents side of things?
