[TX] How long is normal before HR gets in touch with someone involved in an investigation?
Hi everyone-
If you need a more in depth reference to what is happening in my work environment take a look at my past history. 

Long story short, I called HR on Monday to report the harassment from a colleague and they said they would be in touch with me. 
On Tuesday I called them back to ask to set up time to speak with them. The representative handling the investigation said she would put a calendar appointment on by the COB for the next day (Wednesday). 

It is now Friday and it has been radio silent from HR. Is this cause for concern? What could they be doing? Just looking for some advice here- do I need to reach out to HR again and ask to speak again? This is honestly ruining my life because I am so terrified I am going to lose my job or be a casualty of someone elseâ€™s wrong doing. 

Thanks so much for any insight.
