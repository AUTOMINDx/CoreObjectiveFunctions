Mom says I’m going to become a loser
My birthday is soon and I’m going to be spending it alone.  The reason why is because pretty much all of my friends do fall sports and we couldn’t get a time to meet up. I was fine with this cause I’ll just have a party over winter break, but my mom is mad at me for my acceptance. She told me I would become an antisocial loser.
