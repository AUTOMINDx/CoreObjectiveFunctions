Guy (20M) bought me (18F) lunch, then expected sex from me afterwards. How do I respond to this?
So a friend/classmate from college asked to hang out with me last week, when he saw on my snapchat story that I posted a picture I received my associate's degree. I agreed because I thought it'd be nice to catch up with him. We haven't ever had anything more than friendship or indicated that.

He took me to a place and I got a $10 lunch special, he paid although I offered to pay the whole bill or at least my half. After that he drives us to the park, and we sat in his car for a bit and talked. Then he proceeded to move things quick by kissing me and pulling my pants down. I was very shocked because I didn't think he ever saw that way, and I saw him as a friend.

We had a long conversation that went on for an hour, and he was complimenting me but also getting frustrated. Like he was honest that he found me hot and wanted to get with me, and I know he was getting upset. Because he kept rubbing his head and sighing in frustration, asking if we were going to do it or not considering he got us lunch. I didn't really know what else to say besides that I felt uncomfortable and needed time, and asked him to drive me home.

Now a few days ago he said he wanted to take me out to dinner. And I feel that he's going to be expecting sex again even though nothing happened last time.

Edit: forgot to include my question. I wasn't sure how to respond to this. Or if I really did owe him sex since it technically wasn't a date, as he didn't ask me out since he worded it like a hang out.
