What’s going to happen to my paralysis when I die?
22F, white, 4’10, 110 lbs. I had a prenatal stroke and now have left hemiplegia, cerebral palsy affecting my left arm and leg. My toes and three fingers are fully paralyzed and I can’t extend my left arm fully. (Luckily, I’m right handed)

I used the line “you’ll pry it from my cold, dead, paralyzed hand” the other day, which made me wonder: when I die, what happens to my paralyzed parts? Do they loosen up? After I’m dead, what does the difference between my left and right look like?
