I tried partially coming out to my wife and it was a disaster.
I'm a 40 year old with a male body, I realized about a year ago my gender identity is maverique and last week I decided to tell my wife. I thought I was going to find support, after all, she has supported me in all my "weird" exploits (I'm very much into the arts, particularly theatre and dance). But she got really mad at me. We've been having problems in our relationship because I've been asexual for the last 2 years, and she accused me of doing this as a distraction from working on our issues. It makes me sad because she was the one person I confided in about everything and now I fell I have no one to talk about this with.
