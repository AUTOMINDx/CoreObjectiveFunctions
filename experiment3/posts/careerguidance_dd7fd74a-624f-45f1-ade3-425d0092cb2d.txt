Should I keep my job as data analyst that pays 150k but is not fulfilling or chase a job that suits me more but pays significantly less?
I have always dreamed about setting up my own coffee shop or something similar. I enjoy the simple routine work more than crunching my head on Numbers. Is it just plain stupid to leave a decent paying job to pursue this? Is there like a break even point where one should accept the work (which is fine in terms of workload and hours) for what it is to build financial capital? Any arguments for or against are welcome!
