I’m confused and need help
So basically I like guys a lot (I’m a guy) but i don’t want to have sex with guys, but I want to other stuff with them and def date them. I also don’t want to have sex with girls and idk if I’m just broken cuz literally can’t imagine myself having intercourse with anyone. But I really want to have relationships with both and like do other sexual things but not have actual sex. Does this sound weird or common, idk where else to put this even though it doesn’t really fit this community really. All insight welcome!
