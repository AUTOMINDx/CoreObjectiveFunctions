What would happen if you blew up a boat full of gold in the Long Island Sound?
This question is based on Die Hard: With a Vengeance. The villain wants people to believe he has blown up several tons of gold bricks in a gold (to drive up the price of gold, I guess). What would happen if he did this? is the sound to deep to recover gold bricks? Would the gold fuse together and be unsalvageable? Could you go down and cut apart a fused block of gold?
