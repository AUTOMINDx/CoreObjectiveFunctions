Stop Thinking You're a Machiavellian Mastermind
You are not Emperor Palpatine or Otto von Bismarck. You couldn't scheme your way out of a simple chess puzzle. All you do is cover up your negative aspects and turn on the charm. When you're actually cutting nefarious deals or manipulating events to get a desired outcome, then come talk to me. Otherwise you're just doing ol' fashioned image management.

God, stop internalizing stigmatizing garbage.
