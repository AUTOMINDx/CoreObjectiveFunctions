I work to hard in an industry I am slowly starting to hate. What do I do with my life if college doesn't work out?
Going into hospitality I thought it was ok. Not for me in the long term. But something I can do while I figure things out. Well now I've paid off the majority of my debt and want to go back to school for some computer science courses. I want to try and become either a programmer or a cyber crimes investigator. Both sound interesting but that's not the point of this post

I'm afraid that I won't be any good in the fields I want to study in. Or that I can't find a job in the tech industry. All that time and money wasted to finish my degree and become specialized. When I do get sleep that's what keeps me up at night (day? Idk.) The other thing that keeps me up is dreading that I will be in hospitality forever. With no escape. I am good at the job and at this time I can't see a feasible way out without royally screwing over the staff I've grown to love. 

I cannot work in customer service again. I cannot work with the mind numbing public again. I'm sure alot of people are nice enough but "helping" customers that can't even help themselves has made me bitter about the human condition. What are some jobs I could do if my plan A and B don't work out?
