For me, being an only child made it worse.
I remember as a kid being really confused. Adults would always say I was so lucky for being an only child, because I was spoiled rotten with any toys I wanted. Other kids would say I’m lucky, because I don’t have siblings to fight with. But I remember being so envious of kids with siblings. Even when they fought, they still had someone to play with. They had someone they might be able to relate to. They had someone that could watch cartoons with them. They had someone to talk to about how unfair their parents were being. They just had… someone else built into their life. 

I spent so many afternoons after school alone in my room, watching TV on the lowest volume because my dad was sleeping. I spent evenings eating dinner alone in my room, or playing dolls by myself. My mom recently joked how I was always glued to the computer and never wanted to play outside, but I didn’t have anyone to play outside with. When my parents were mad, I had no one else to talk to. I felt like I had no allies in my home life. It felt so lonely. 

I know some people had/have really terrible experiences and relationships with their siblings. But I still wonder what my life would have looked like if I had a sibling to turn to. Someone I could maybe have a lifetime bond to have my back. An ally even in adulthood. I hope people with good siblings know how lucky they are. I envy you.
