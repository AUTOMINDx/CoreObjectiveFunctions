Important Tip for guys from a Happily Married man.
Don't ever settle for being settled for.

Don't be her second choice. Don't be his second choice either, for a gay brothers out there.

But realistically for all men you can, with some time and patience, find a partner who will see you as her first pick as a partner.

Even if that person has been in relationships before or even married. You will know if you are her second choice or she is settling for you. And if you are unsure, find a way to make sure.

I've been married 13 years and my wife is my first choice and I am hers, that level of desire and love has helped us stay strong through the worst of it. I hope all you guys out there find that too.


*EDIT* 

Gonna add this little example of what I mean, it's from a comment I made to someone else.

Enjoy my cartoonish example. Simple yet satisfying.

'If Susie is in love with Tommy but settles for and marries Timmy because Tommy won't pick her, then Timmy did not win a good partner he lost out on the chance of meeting Sara, Samantha, or Bill from accounting who would have falling in love with Timmy first instead of Tommy.'
