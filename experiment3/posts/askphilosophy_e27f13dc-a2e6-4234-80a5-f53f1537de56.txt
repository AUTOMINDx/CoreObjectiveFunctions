What really is Ontology?
I've been interested in Ontology for some years now, but I never quite found a satisfying definition of what it really is. Obviously we can trace Ontology to it's greek origins and talk about the definition of τò óν, but from what I've been studying, the discourse about Ontology begins in a context in which conventional western metaphysics is obsolete, due to Kant's works. Ontology, I believe, is a post-critical reconstruction of the discourse about Being. However, how could we differentiate it better from  metaphysics?
