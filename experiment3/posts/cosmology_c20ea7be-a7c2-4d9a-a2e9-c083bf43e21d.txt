If anyone is familiar with Alan Guth please consider helping little.
I was really enjoying an Alan Guth lecture, and thought I understood it fairly well at the time. But I was confused about his discussion of repulsive gravity, as he was discussing dark energy and both of their relationships to inflation and vacuum energy (potentially) .  So my question is.. was he using the term repulsive gravity in explaining dark energy, as they are potentially one in the same, or they two completely separate fields in his inflation model? Is was something about how he explained inflation and expanding spacetime within the energy fields and potential quantum gravity relationship with dark energy that made at lot of sense to me at the time, but not at all the repulsive gravity concept, unless he was using that term interchangeable with dark energy more or less. He kept on saying repulsive gravity, but never really explained what would create a geometry of space time to create this, so I am hoping he meant something more along the lines of the quantum field of gravity interacting with something with the inflation simultaneously creates the space time curvature type normal type gravity thing, and the repulsive gravity. 
Nevermind, I will just listen to it again next time I have to drive somewhere two hours, it made perfect sense at the time. I just did not know if he describes repulsive gravity and dark energy as two different properties or he meant they more less the same thing. If he was actually discussing two different properties, then imma just give up.
