What has your experience as a chronically ill person receiving mental health care (psychiatry or therapy) been like?
Tbh I am procrastinating.

I was thinking about this one psychiatrist I had who was kind of awful. She kept pressuring me about meds I had bad reactions to or things I needed to avoid bc of my heart condition, and I had no idea why for the longest time.

Turns out she fully did not believe I had anything wrong with me. She full on asked me if I had a real diagnosis from a real doctor. like "who diagnosed you?" "uhhh my EP?" "and is that a physician?" and when I got her to explain (I was like literally what other kind of doctor is there I thought that;s just like. the same thing) it turns out she genuinely thought I had gotten a fake diagnosis from like. A holistic person, I don't remember how she said it, bc she said my issues "didn't make sense". Which is. Audacious.

Anyway, basically everyone else I know has had similar (if mildly less ridiculous) examples with mental healthcare professionals being the worst to them about their illness/disability or prescribing them meds which are directly contraindicated for people with their disorder. What has your experience been like? Open offer to commiserate here.

Edit: literally just to say that I have good experiences too, I love my current people. My current psych is super careful and understanding abt my heart issues messing w meds for me, and my therapist thinks that whole experience is horrifying and helped get me to fire my psych when I was too nervous to so I could find a better one. I don't want anyone to be too nervous to get treatment, just def feel validated in firing them when they're jerks
