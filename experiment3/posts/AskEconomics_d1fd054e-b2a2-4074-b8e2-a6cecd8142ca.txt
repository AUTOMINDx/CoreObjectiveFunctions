Developing countries with high interest rates
Hi all (sorry for bad English ahead)

Many developing countries have really high interest rates. But having high interest rates discourages business activities but lowering the rates does not look good either due to currency depreciation and rising inflation.
So what options do developing countries have?

Thank you
