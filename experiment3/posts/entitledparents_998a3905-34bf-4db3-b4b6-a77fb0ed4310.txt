Absolute Karen tries forcing her way into my doctors appointment slot.
Scheduled an appointment at the CVS minute clinic to see the doctor for a stye. When my time came the doctor popped out of her office to grab me and some Karen came from seemingly nowhere and intercepted doc demanding her preteen child be seen for a strep test. Doctor said she was already with a patient (me) and asked Karen if she had made an appointment, to which Karen huffily replied “NO! But it’s an EMERGENCY” strep is not an emergency. Doctor told her that all the appointment slots were filled for the day and I swear this lady acted like she the doctor was leaving her child to bleed out in the streets “What you’re just NOT  going to help my child then? Where are we supposed to go?”

This went back and forth for quite some time, with me getting progressively more angry because it was my time slot and I had other shit to do. Eventually someone else, I don’t know exactly what their position was (maybe a pharmacist?) came up to handle Karen, and the poor doctor nudged her out of the way of the door and ushered me in before closing it super fast hahah. I get it sucks when your kid is sick, but strep isn’t remotely serious. From the look of the kid he didn’t even have it, I’ve had strep several times and the kid looked and sounded fine.

Edit: I get it, strep CAN turn deadly serious, but that’s not the point here. Also, the doctor did suggest the ER but Karen voiced concern about “not wanting to be around a bunch of sicker people”
