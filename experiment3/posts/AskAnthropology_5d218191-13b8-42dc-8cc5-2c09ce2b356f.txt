Customs re-interpreted
I'm not an anthropologist by any means, and my question will be maybe elementary.

How common is that a group of people carries on some custom for centuries (e.g. a ritual) without understanding its original meaning, or maybe even producing a novel but obviously wrong explanation for it?
