My gf lost 3 guy friends after she started dating me as they wanted to date her
We just started dating 4 months ago and in that span she has lost 3 long time friends as they all wanted to date her. All these guys had been her friends since she was in college, so 5+ years. She is very sad about losing such long time friends. What can I say to console her? It has never happened with me, so I am at a loss here. Thank you in advance for the advice!
