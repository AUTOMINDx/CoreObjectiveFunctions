Does anyone else have their mind blown by how different life is with a healthy family?
23f, no contact now, moved out, much happier without them, wouldn't take them back for the world.

BUT

Does anyone else have these mind blowing realisations on a near daily basis that other people's lives were and are just... So much easier?

Like imagine moving out of your parents home in your own time, being encouraged to get a good job and save, being supported through moving and being able to get a nice place because of it?

Or growing up being able to talk to your parents about your crushes and have them listen and not be utterly terrified to bring a partner home - or even be excited to introduce them to your parents!

Or even just the idea that some kids can get up before school, put on morning cartoons, grab a snack from the cupboard and chill out before being taken to school for a day of education, then being excited to come home and have a snack and do some colouring or something

Like it just blows my mind that they just... Grew up happy? I always wondered how other kids were so oblivious to their parents problems and wondered why they didn't care about their craft being good enough to take home... It's because that's normal for kids.
