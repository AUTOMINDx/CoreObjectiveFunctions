I came out, now I'm done
I recently came out to my friends as pan (one if them made a frying pan joke) but they accepted, half of them are lgbt too so its great. I know for a fact tho, that my grandparents on my dad's side would be disappointed because they're heavily right. On my mom's side because they're Christians. And my dad because, he's interesting. I do not plan on ever coming out, until I get married or something. Currently I'm 13 so it's gonna be a while. Just felt like saying something to open me up to this sub.
