How has becoming self-aware of your narcissistic traits affected you?
I feel relieved because I know what I have to work on, but I've also become extremely paranoid because of it. I am afraid that my friends will figure out what kind of person I really am (or who I think I am at least) and that they won't look at me the same anymore.
