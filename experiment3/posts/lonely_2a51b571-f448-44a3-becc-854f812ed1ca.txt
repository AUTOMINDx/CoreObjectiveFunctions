Anyone else feel like they are too conventionally unattractive to ever date?
I have a bad jawline,crooked teeth,I am extremely short,standing at 5'8 barefoot. I am extremely skinny and have a crooked nose. 

Not surprisingly no girl has ever shown even a tiny bit of interest in me.

Any one here who has had similar experiences?

People tell me to wait as I am very young(I am 18 years old). But my features aren't going to change as I get older. As they were fated by my genes.

It sucks to have to suffer the consequences of something I had no control over.
