Rant; trying to navigate PTSD in a new relationship is painful and exhausting.
I(22F) have been with my girlfriend(24F) officially for about a month now, we’ve been sleeping with each other longer. it took me a really long time to go from just caressing to cuddling let alone sex but i got there after a while.

Things have went smooth generally but now that we spend way more time together sex and intimacy has been hit or miss. My biggest trigger is being touched and not anticipating it. Sometimes we can enjoy a movie together and cuddle or even some under the covers bonding, other times i get worked up on flashbacks from something as simple as her opening the front door, and sometimes i get panic attacks in the middle of us starting to “do it” over just her touch. some days i just wanna enjoy a moment with her but all the wrong things start flooding back or i start feeling in danger. i know my triggers pretty well but sometimes things come straight out of left field

despite all these problems she’s been such a massive help in just how understanding and accommodating she is. i couldn’t ask for anyone better it just sucks because i feel like i’m causing a divide between us. i just want consistent quality time together without my brain going fucky
