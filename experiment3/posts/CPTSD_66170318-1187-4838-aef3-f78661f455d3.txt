I told my mom I have CPTSD
Her response was “ do I need to repaint the walls in your old room? Get rid of all the furniture? I just wouldn’t want you to not come home because you’re so traumatized”

Told my therapist. She said, “that might be your moms love language, she wants to do things for you” 

How many of you know damn well that my mom being dramatic to dismiss my problems?!
