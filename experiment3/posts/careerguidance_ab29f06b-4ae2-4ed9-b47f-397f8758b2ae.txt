Women in Tech, what is your experience and how do you feel about receiving sufficient mentoring/coaching/overall support from women higher up the chain?
It is no secret that the tech field is dominated by men. There’s a lot of talk and initiative around “women in tech” and growing our presence (we have come a long way compared to 5-10 years ago) but as someone who has worked at a few very large corporations, I see a different side to the story. 

I have generally noticed that women who make it to management level and higher in the tech field, tend to become highly competitive and tough while being less compassionate and understanding.

If you have gotten the support to move up the corporate ladder and/or hone your skills within the field, please share what was it specifically that your mentor did that helped you? 

If not, how can the women in tech be supportive towards each other so that we can equalize the playing field?
