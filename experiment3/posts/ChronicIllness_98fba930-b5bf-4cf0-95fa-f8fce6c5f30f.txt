Pray for me you guys. I have one day left of Lyrica and I havent heard back about my refill. Idk if I can even get it this week. Merry Christmas to me? Iâ€™m in a state with legal pot so that may be my substitute until I can get more. ðŸ¥²
Edit: Im not getting the medication before Monday. My doc doesnâ€™t have an emergency line that I can get a hold of. Pharmacies wonâ€™t help.
