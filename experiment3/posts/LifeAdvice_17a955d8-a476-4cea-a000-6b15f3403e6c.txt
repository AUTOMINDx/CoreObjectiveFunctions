I feel afraid of success and I don't know why.
I know that the profession I would like to pursue would absolutely bring abundance and success into my life. I already know I definitely have what it takes to make it and I know I deserve it but for some odd reason I feel selfish for knowing I deserve it and all the benefits it brings. Any thoughts at all? I'm genuinely confused.
