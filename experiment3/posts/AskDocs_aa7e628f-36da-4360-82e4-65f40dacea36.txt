30F dealt with chronic Diarrhea for the last 20 years, every single day.
30F white 5'05" 220lbs, I have fatty liver disease, had my gallbladder removed due to stones in 2016 and have had an enlarged spleen since I had mono 15 years ago, currently smoke do not drink, no medications, no recreational drugs.

      Since I was a around 10 years old I've always had diarrhea, 5-6 times a day. I could drink water and it I'd have the worst stomach cramps. My diarrhea has always been very watery, frothy, stringy and neon yellow and orange. 

       Not entirely sure if it's related but I have also had the worst heart burn 24/7 this past year, to the point it feels like my lungs are constantly burning on fire and it's making me cough.


       I was diagnosed with IBS-D by 2 doctors who ran no tests (short of cutting dairy and gluten which did nothing), I feel like they just slapped a name on it to shut me up. My life is miserable. I'm constantly in pain and am literally suffering. 

      Any of you Docs on here might know what problem I may have?!  Please. Someone has to know.
