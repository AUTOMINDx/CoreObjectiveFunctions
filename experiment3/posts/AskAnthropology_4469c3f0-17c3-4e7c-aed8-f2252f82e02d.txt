Running a society without writing?
How do you operate a complex society, managing tens of thousands of tax-payers and potential soldiers, without a standardized writing system? I was always led to believe that writing was a prerequisite for a complex society, but apparently that's not the case (Cahokia, Nan Madol, Hawaii, Zulu Empire, etc). How was the administration of these states/empires accomplished without writing?
