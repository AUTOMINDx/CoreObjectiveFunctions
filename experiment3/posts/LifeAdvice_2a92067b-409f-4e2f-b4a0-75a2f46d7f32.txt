Where Do I Even Start ?
This is a spam account. I thought I’d create it so I can always remember this time of my life. Honestly I don’t know when I’ll find peace, I pray someday. My life is a sad and I’m only 20(m). I don’t even know where to start, My car got repossessed earlier today. I have several maxed out credit cards. I have an apartment I don’t even live at but still pay rent and owe multiple thousands of dollars to. I have another car that isn’t reposed so I had 2 cars and one got repossessed. I am in tons of student loan debt and other dumb debt. I honestly. Man life is so bad I have expired tags and have several pieces of jewelry in the pawnshop. I just don’t know where to go from here. I have a gambling problem,I have a drug problem. I had a girl i could potentially marry in high school and I was dumb and let her go. I am a loner I have no friends. I just don’t know what to do I mean I do make a decent amount of money but something has to change. My mom doesn’t even tell me anything but I know she’s disappointed and I’m disappointed in myself. i owe her better. I will do better. I think i’ll do weekly updates about how my life goes for the next year.
