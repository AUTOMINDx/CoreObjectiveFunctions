What will be some of the impacts of millennials/gen z in the U.S. not having enough savings to retire?
Lots of people who are millennials and gen z have less savings, lower assets (e.g. not able to enter housing market) and fewer millennials and gen z are having children (who could potentially support them if they are unable to support themselves). Wages do not seem to be keeping up with inflation and a lot of people in this age group enter the workforce with student loan debt.

Whatâ€™s going to happen when this generation reaches retirement age?

Have there been any studies that have attempted to predict what some of consequences will be?
