My professor mentioned the argument that romantic love wasn't truly a concept until the invention of the (romance) novel in the 1700s. Does that argument hold weight? How does it reconcile earlier depictions of romantic love, such as Hermia and Lysander in A Midsummer Night's Dream?
Alternatively, am I misunderstanding the argument? It was mentioned while my professor discussed marriage among peasants in Reformation Europe.
