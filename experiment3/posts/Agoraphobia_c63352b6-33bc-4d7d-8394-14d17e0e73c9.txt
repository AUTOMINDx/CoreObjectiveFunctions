Failing as a Mom
One of my weekly exposures has been picking my son up from kindergarten on Wednesdays. It’s a high pressure exposure for me because the thought of panicking when my son depends on me terrifies me. It’s been hard but I’ve been doing pretty well, the school is only a few minutes drive from my house and I go early to make sure I’m not battling with other parents for a parking spot (cars and driving are my biggest phobia and the main reason for my agoraphobia). My biggest fear has always been that my fight or flight panic response would kick in while I’m waiting to pick him up and I would leave. And today it happened. I got to the school to wait and I realized I didn’t have my phone with me, I had forgotten it at home. And the panic was immediate. I felt trapped without anyway to call someone for help (my parents live nearby and my husband works from home on Wednesdays) not having that safety net that I could call someone “just in case” was too much for me. I could feel the derealization kicking in and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. There was still 15 minutes until class let out so I left. I came home and told my husband to do the school pickup. I feel like an absolute failure as a mother, I don’t think I’ve ever felt as bad and guilty about my response to panicking as I do today. I’m posting this here just to vent to people that can understand how awful it is to feel like your brain is constantly driven by fear.
