[Spiderman 2] why didn't j Jonah DNA tested Spiderman mask to learn his secret identity?
When Peter stopped being Spiderman some hobo sold the suit to Jameson, why couldn't he try to use the fluids in it to DNA test it? I mean pretty sure the mask should have hair and spit

Also, couldn't the authorities use the web remainings for dna testing since his webs are organic?
