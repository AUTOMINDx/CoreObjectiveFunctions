campus interview tips?
Iâ€™m going to have my first ever in-person campus interview in a R2 public university in the US. Would really love to hear some tips here. Is there anything in particular you wish you knew before your campus interview? Or anything you did/said during the campus visit that made you a favorable candidate to the search committee/dean/chair/students/other faculty members?
