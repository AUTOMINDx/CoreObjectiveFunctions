Thomas Sowell’s basic economics
I want to start getting into economics. I have a copy of Basic Economics for some reason and i’m wondering if it’s a good place to start. I know Sowell is very pro free markets so i want to make sure it’s not biased. If it is, what’s a good book to start with for econ?
