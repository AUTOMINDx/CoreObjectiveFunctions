hatial hernia
i might have a hernia, i haven’t gotten an endoscopy yet, i’m sceduled for the 30th. However, I don’t get reflux from some acidic foods, when i breathe sometimes i feel my stomach gurgle. When i have reflux, it affects mostly my ears and nostrils. I don’t get heartburn. I’m not sure what the root cause of this was because two months ago i got severe heartburn that maybe was caused by my eating disorder (anorexia). At this point i’m thinking about surgery but obviously need to go through all these tests to get one. Plus, i’m 16, healthy weight and i’m somewhat active. It’s really hard for me rn because nothing else seems to cure the symptoms i have sometimes not even bland diets.
