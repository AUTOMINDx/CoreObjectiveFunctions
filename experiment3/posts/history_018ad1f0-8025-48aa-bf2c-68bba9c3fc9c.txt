Why did consorts to the Chinese Emperor change their names every time they got a new rank?
I've noticed that consorts (wives and concubines) to the Chinese emperors seemed to change their name everytime they got a new rank. For example, Empress Dowager Cixi was born Lady Yehenara, then became Noble Lady Lan, then Consort Yi, before finally becoming Empress Dowager Cixi. Why did all the name changes occur?
