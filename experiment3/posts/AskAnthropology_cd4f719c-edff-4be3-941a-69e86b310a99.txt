_____ is to anthropology as WALS is to linguistics?
https://wals.info/feature maps linguistic features around the globe; you can pick a feature (e.g. tonal versus non-tonal languages) and see which is most common, where in the world they occur, etc.

Is there a site like this for anthropology? Has someone put anthro features (e.g. circumcision, matrilineal/patrilineal, polygamy/monogamy, etc.) on a map like this?

Thanks
