What changes in the shipping, maritime and cruise industries happened after the sinking of RMS Titanic
So I was watching an old "seconds from disaster" nat geo rerun a while back and it got me thinking. The Titanic was one of the biggest most public disasters of its day, right? And the reasons it sank have been known to us for a long time right? How did the ocean going industries react? Were there commissions, massive investigations, lawsuits? Did lots of heads roll? What sort of changes did cruise ships make to prevent it happening again?

Most films and documentaries ive seen about titanic end after the survivors are rescued so im curious about the after-aftermath
