I miss my everyone
This is just a rant, I move away to start a new life in another country by starting my masters. I did this because one day ill inherit my dad’s business and that idea made me sloppy and reliant on him so I saved money, sold my car and pay for my masters so i can earn experience elsewhere and comeback later more prepared and reliable. My dad knows this and he is happy for me and all my family as well but damn i really miss them

I miss entering home and having always someone at home, i miss eating together as a family, i miss my sisters telling me join them for scary movies, i miss my mom checking on me all day for everything even if it was annoying, i miss watching football with my dad, i miss my baby sister hugging me, i miss my middle sister giving me the cute eyes so i buy her stuff, i miss my lazy scary dog who plays hide n seek every time we have to wash him, i miss my cousin which i could always talk until sunrise, i miss my friends who i have shared all, i miss my friend who we share “more” before i left… 

I expected all this, but today was harder than normal… i miss you all. I promise I’ll come back I love you
