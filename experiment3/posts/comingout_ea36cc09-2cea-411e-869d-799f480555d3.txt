Trans at uni?
So I'm going to university next year and I don't know whether or not to go into the uni with a different name to my deadname, as I'm not out at home so don't know if they would find out. 

If I don't go in as a trans student then I can still put an optional name but I don't know what to put. So far, I've thought of J, JJ or Jem (because they can be taken as nicknames for Jasmine, my birth name)

Thanks.
