I don’t understand what’s happening to me. And neither does anyone else.
Age: 30

Sex: female. 

Weight: 205lbs

Height: 5’4

Medical conditions- fatty liver, hyperlipedemia, upper respiratory infection. 

Medications- vitamin D, sometimes fish oil, just started augmentin. 

3 days ago (before antibiotics) I was feeling totally fine. I leaned my head back to talk to my mom and all of a sudden a wave of numbness and tingling and weird feeling washed over my face and inside my mouth/throat. I called 911 (first time ever, it was super intense). By the time I hung up- it was mostly better. EMTs offered the hospital, but I said no. I had another smaller version of it in 15 minutes. Then I was totally fine. 

Yesterday.  I had a smaller version of this. I went to the ER. They took blood (basic metabolic, electrolytes) and did a CT of my head. Both were clear. The ER doc said he had no idea what it could be, but didn’t think it was a mini stroke. 

Today, I woke up. During breakfast- again. And then a few more times. But much “lighter” then the first time. And lighter than yesterday. 

My blood pressure shoots  up during, but Is fine 5 min after. My heart rate is fine. My spo2 is fine. 

I was eating the second and third day when this happened. 

I don’t understand what this is. I have no history of anxiety. Could it be connected to the cold I’ve had? Did I fuck up a muscle that somehow is giving me periodic nerve shot thought my face/head? Has anyone seen anything like this?
