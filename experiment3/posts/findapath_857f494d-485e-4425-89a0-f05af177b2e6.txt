Jobs with variety that are often outside
I 32m have been in a lot of different places, handy man to bartender, millwright and sales.. I just can't decide on anything to really pursue.
I've dabbled in so much I can't imagine doing one thing for more than a year or two. 
But, I have Crohn's. I need health insurance and my body is back and forth. I don't want to work in an office, maybe physical therapy (I've heard people love this line of work but who knows).

I am so lost.

Edit: Thanks for responding everyone. I have the INFP personality type. Might be bullshit but it resonates a bit. I appreciate all the input.
