Where do control engineers wind up?
I've been working at my first position out of school as a controls engineer, and I am wondering to what other fields our skills lend themselves. It's really interesting work, and I like that I get my hands in a machine most days of the week, but the lifestyle is definitely not for me. I think I'll be okay with it for a year or two, but I want more stability.

Have any controls engineers here gotten out of factories, and found interesting work with a better lifestyle?
