Gender Norms in Relationships?
Do you find societal norms (in regards to gender roles) to be exhausting in a heterosexual relationship? 

I find that even people I know who have male partners that are supportive of feminist movements and women’s rights still benefit from this unspoken (or maybe spoken) gender norms. 

One in particular that I have noticed (in own relationships and those of my friends) is that in a hetero relationship, there tends to be more emphasis placed on the male’s free-time outside of the relationship. It seems that in most relationships, men have more free-time and flexibility to hang out with  friends and work on hobbies. If the couple is participating in a group activity/outing it tends to be with the male partner’s friends. This is not to say that I or my friends prefer that we don’t hang out. It just seems like the female’s social calendar is expected to be second to the males. It appears that in society, the male social life is more important. 

How has deeply engrained gender norms effected your relationship? Do your partners have an understanding of how or why these gender norms manifest and how frustrating they can be? 

Feel free to elaborate on other frustrating gender norms.
