I'm so insecure in relationships
My father is a long time alcoholic, as long as I remember. My parents split when I was 10 because of it. I was forced to stay with him for a time. He was a great dad sober but emotionally abusive and manipulative when he was drunk. 

As an adult I have cut him out of my life.

I struggle with trust in relationships, friendship and romantic. I love my husband but I get very anxious when he talks to other women. He never been anything close to unfaithful.
With friendships I default think that no one likes me, and if they do they must secretly not like me very much or think I'm too much effort. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? I have tried therapy and I am on antidepressants and they both helped. I just can't escape this feeling of mistrust.
