Do any modern philosophers take seriously The Republic's criticism of literature?
I studied English in college and grad school, and my professors often mentioned The Republic's banishment of poetry from the ideal city. But this was usually brought up as an aside, something to chuckle at or to make the study of English seem more edgy or something. And as far as I can tell, public opinion is on my professors' side; it's hard for me to find any modern source that brings up The Republic's criticisms without immediately batting them away again.

I was wondering if anyone here could point me to a modern philosopher who seriously contemplates or even builds on Plato's judgment of literature. I don't know if I'd end up being convinced, but I'd at least like to hear the argument. My spidey senses start tingling when it feels like absolutely everyone has the same opinion on a certain issue. (And okay, I may be doubting the value of my MA in English... but my own angst side, it's an interesting philosophical question.)

Thank you!
