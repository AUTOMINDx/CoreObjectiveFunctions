Is it possible to work on side projects while doing your PhD? (USA)
I’m thinking of projects that only take a few hours a week (say max ~5 hrs/week total). Some examples that I’m interested in are working on and developing an app, working on a new algorithm, or a machine learning process, as well as some non-academic projects such as investing (stocks and real estate) or entrepreneurial endeavors. 

My goal after the PhD is to get into industry, which I’d say is pretty typical for my field. However, I don’t wanna be in a position where I have to start from scratch after receiving my doctorate. 

P.s. In case its relevant, its for a PhD in statistics and going into the program I’d have a very strong preparatory background (eg: having taken most 1st year PhD requirements already, as well as a strong math and CS background).
