Are most boys like this?
I 16f have a boyfriend 16m. He was over at mine, and at night whenever we’re at each other’s house it’s basically routine at this point
I’ll lay up next to him and he’ll play with my hair, or hold me. 

But this time he asked if we could swap things about. When I was running my nails on his scalp his reactions were so intense lol 😂 like “shit that’s so goooood fuck.” And I vous just tell by his body language and stuff as well. 

Like I get it, it’s nice and relaxing, but it’s like he was entering another plane of existence. Idk if it’s just a me thing or a boys bs girls thing or what lol 😂
