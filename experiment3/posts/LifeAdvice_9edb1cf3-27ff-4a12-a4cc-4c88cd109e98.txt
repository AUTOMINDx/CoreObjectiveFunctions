30, single, childless and panicking
Feels like everyone around me is in a committed relationship with kids and I'm honestly starting to get a lot of anxiety about running out of time....can anyone else relate? Mad at myself for wasting so much time in dead end relationships with men that I knew weren't marriage/father of my children material........
