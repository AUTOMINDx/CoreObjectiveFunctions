Went out for the first time since March 2020! With no panic!!
Since the lockdowns in 2020, it became really convenient for me to just stay at home and avoid all the exposure I had been working on. As a result, I ended up highly anxious about eventually having to go out, to the point that I hadn't even taken my covid vaccine. I finally gathered the courage and went out today, to a centre 5 mins away from my house. Felt a little anxious on the way but no full blown anxiety attack, unlike how I catastrohphised it in my mind during the days leading up to the appointment. I had anxiety around taking the vaccine too, but it's been about 2 hours since the shot and I feel ok! Still a little anxious about side effects, but otherwise ok! I'm back home now, showered and resting, looking back at how I've achieved 2 milestones today! Cant help but get a little teary eyed, because I really thought I would never be able to do it. 

Just want to share this here to bring motivation to anyone struggling in their healing journey, just take leap of faith and trust it will go well. The worst case scenarios we imagine, they almost never end up coming true! :')
