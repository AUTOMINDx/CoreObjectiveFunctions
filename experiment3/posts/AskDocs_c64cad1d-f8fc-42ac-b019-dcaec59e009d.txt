Lost tampon in vagina
25 Female. Not used to using tampons. Guy friends bought me tampons instead of pads but I put it in the wrong hole (put it in my vagina not the other one) and is lost inside me. Panicking because I’m embarrassed to mention it to my friends since I’m the only female and don’t know what to do to get it out.
