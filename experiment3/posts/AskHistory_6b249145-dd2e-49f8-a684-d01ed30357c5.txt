Why is territorial annexation generally unacceptable in the modern era?
When looking at history, it seems that countries often annexed their neighbours' territory and said behaviour is generally accepted by other countries (Korea by Japan in 1910, Tuva by the USSR in 1944, etc.). Nowadays, annexation is frowned upon among the international community, with the annexations of Crimea and Kuwait causing massive controversy and military intervention (in the case of Kuwait) by other foreign powers. Why is this and what shaped this current attitude?
