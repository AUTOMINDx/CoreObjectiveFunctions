I was a “good baby”
When I asked if I cried a lot as a baby, just out of random curiosity, my bio mother said no, and that I was a very “good baby”. I hate it when people say that. It implies there’s such thing as a “bad baby.”

It’s not good for babies not to cry. If a baby isn’t crying out for a caregiver, that means it’s already learned that they’re cries aren’t going to be answered. Babies are supposed to cry. A baby that doesn’t cry isn’t a “good baby”, it’s a neglected baby. 

I already know she emotionally neglected me and I’ll never forgive her for that. I just wanted to see what she would say. And I got that horrible answer. I’m not at all surprised though.
