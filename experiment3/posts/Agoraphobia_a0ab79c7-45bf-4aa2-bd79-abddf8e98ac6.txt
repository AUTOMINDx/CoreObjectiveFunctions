Anyone ever get outside and feel they don’t belong out there anymore anyway?
I’ve been housebound for ~12-13 years now and I’ve realized that just about every time I’ve had any kind of escape to the outside world that didn’t go horribly wrong, I still felt very empty inside (this was all before COVID). Seeing people go about their lives felt very alien and actually made me feel depressed. It didn’t feel like I belonged amongst anyone else. Being on the road, going in stores, getting food, it didn’t matter—I always just felt a profound sadness and like I just wanted to go home. Even when it wasn’t a panic to flee home. And sure enough, I always felt better when I got home.

I don’t know if it’s some kind of Stockholm syndrome with my house as my captor or what but it just doesn’t feel right out there.
