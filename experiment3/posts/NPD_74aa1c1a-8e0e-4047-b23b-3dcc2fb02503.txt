I'm a cured narcissist, ask me anything
When I say cured, I mean the driving force that grafted itself onto my id (freud) during adolescence regressed during therapy which unarrested my empathy which was in a child like state. My core personality structure which was designed to extract adulation from others and avoid interpersonal relationships/criticism is still mainly there but has softened heaps. Ask away.
