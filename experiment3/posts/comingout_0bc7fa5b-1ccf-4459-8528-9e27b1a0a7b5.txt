How do I come out?
I am currently a senior in high school. I am a football player who is going to play in the next level. I also play volleyball. But most of my friend and family(not including parents) are kind of homophobic. I donâ€™t want to completely change my life but I also want to be who I am. I know no one will see this just wanted to get this off my chest.
