Do any of you watch a TV series over and over and over again ?
I mich prefer watching the same series over and over because I already know what is going to happen. Knowing what is going to happens helps me relax while I'm watching and enjoy the series more. Is it just me? 

My husband doesn't understand why I do this even though I keep telling him why.
