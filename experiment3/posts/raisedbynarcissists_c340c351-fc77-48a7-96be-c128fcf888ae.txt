My Narc Mom wants to explain her narc rage blowup to my kids without me present. My Enabler Dad said at their young age it will be less confusing if I am not there. She literally told my kids she never wants to see us again just a month ago.
WTF

Edit: Thank you everyone! I told them no.  And without explanation.  I knew that was the right call and your support helped me to be brave.
