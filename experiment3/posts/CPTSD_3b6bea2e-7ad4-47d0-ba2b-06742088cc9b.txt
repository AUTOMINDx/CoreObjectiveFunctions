People like me... because of my coping mechanisms...
Why do people even like me?
1. "Because you never get angry.
2. Because you give and give and give. 
3. Because you are genuine and people know where they stand with you."

1. Coping mechanism 
2. Coping mechanism 
3. Not true. 

I hate the first two and I wish the 3rd was true. 

This kind of goes back to the "am I just my trauma?' question. 

Does anyone else relate? No one seems to understand why I'm so upset about people liking me because "I'm nice"
