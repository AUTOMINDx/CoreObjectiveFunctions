I was sexually assaulted by my best friend and their S/O. I still don't know how to process what happened.
I (28F) was sexually assaulted by my guy best friend (32M) of 5 years and his significant other (32F). I haven’t talked to either of them since the incident (~3 weeks). 

I completely froze in the situation and I haven't told anyone because I am embarrassed and bothered and I am disgusted with myself. As much as I tried to get out of the situation, I couldn't. I feel so disgusting, so stupid, and like an idiot, who truly couldn't defend myself. 

I don't know how to feel, I still don't know how to emotionally and mentally process what had happened, I don't know how to move past this and not think of what had happened, when it somehow is the only thing on my mind. I hate that this has happened to me, and I hate that it was by my own friend who I trusted. It seems like its all my fault for trusting them and being comfortable around them (since were friends), that it "allowed" them to take advantage of me. 

I've been cooped up at home. I have lost sensation down there, because now I'm bothered by the idea of being touched. I haven’t talked to other friends, because now I don't know how to feel about them.

How do you come to terms that this happened? How do you forget that long of a friendship? How can I feel comfort in my own body again? How do you work on not allowing others to fool you? 

It's always when life is going great, that life then decides to sucker punch you right in the gut, stooping you down to a new low.

Edit: The amount of kind words, support, and advice that I have received from you all has been incredible, and I truly thank you all.
