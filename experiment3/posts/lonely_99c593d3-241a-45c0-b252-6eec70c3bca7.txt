I’m married but feel incredibly alone.
22m, my wife and I have been married for almost 3 years, and yet I already feel like she doesn’t want to be with me. She hates talking about anything I like, she gets mad when I talk to much or when I have an opinion different from hers. I never see my friends or my family anymore only ever hers, and I never can vent or seem upset or else she starts crying and I feel horrible.
