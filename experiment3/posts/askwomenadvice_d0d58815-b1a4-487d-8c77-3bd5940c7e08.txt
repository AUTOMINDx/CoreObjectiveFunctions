Doubtful about a new guy I'm dating, seeing red flags but don't know if I'm overthinking
So I 26 F, began dating a guy (25) 2 months ago. We got off to a rocky start (I found out he was also dating someone else while claiming to be exclusive with me). I broke it off, but decided to give him a chance so since then we've been exclusive with each other. 

However, there are some things that make me really uncomfortable:

1. He always lets me pick the tab whenever we go out. There've been times I've said I'm strapped for cash, but he still let me pay. I've tried to discuss this with him, but he always took offense and shut off.

2. Lately, I've noticed him losing interest in me a little. 

3. Whenever we meet  its always about where we can go eat/drink, never just talk and hang out without having to spend anything. 

4. He never tries to know anything about me or my family. As a result, lately we've been falling short of things to talk about, or one sided conversations after which he immediately wants to either make out or have sex.

What do I do? Should I continue with this guy, or break it off?

TL;DR red flags or am I just over thinking?

UPDATE: I broke up with him, realised he wasn't really into me but what I was offering.
