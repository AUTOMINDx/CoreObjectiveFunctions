Can I Get a Congrats?
I got into a “fight” with a friend because I needed to set a clear boundary. We talked it over in a respectful manner while explaining our feelings and perspectives. I am just really proud of myself. This is not something I’d be able to do years ago. I’m also just happy that I have a friend like this one in my life. Hell yeah to healthy relationships 🤟
