Is it possible to build body resistance against electricity?
First of, Merry Christmas everyone, I hope you are all doing great.

So I was just wondering the other day what would happen if someone would be shocked multiple times a day. Would they feel less pain the more they go?? Or isnâ€™t it possible to build body resistance against electricity. 

I am quite curious, so if someone answers that would be fantastic (:
