A guy I slept with told me he wants me to have a bigger ass and do my make up like one of the Kardashians. What should I do?
Hey fellow redditor user

Me  and this guy are both 18 and have been going out for quite some time  and slept together a few times. Last night after we finished tho he told  me he really thinks my butt is only okay (it's kinda big imo and I'm  self conscious about it) but then he told me he would love it if it was  bigger.

Now I feel very weird  because I he was insinuating that he wants me to have a butt like one of  the Kardashians and has told me on numerous occasions how hot he finds  them and even asked me to copy their hair and make up to resemble them. I  think it's kind of a special request and I don't really know what to  do.

What do you guys think?
