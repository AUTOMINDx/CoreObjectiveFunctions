Why do psychotherapists still believe in CBT?
With due respect, but seems to me that most of CBT-versed psychotherapists have no clue of what psychopathology and severe mental ilness are. If someone comes to you saying that he/she want to see meaning in life again, because they never felt happiness, why the hell would you base your therapy sessions in "developing skills", or "thinking positive", or "disfunctional thoughts"?

I'm sorry if I wrote something wrong, I'm not english native.

Edit: Now I see, a lot of people will buy anything that carries the sayings "evidence-based" and "achieving goals". And for those who got downvote: keep your condescension and sarcasm to yourself, I asked a legitimate question, were it obvious I wouldn't have come here to ask.
