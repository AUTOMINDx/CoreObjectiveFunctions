21 male in college
I don’t know what I’m doing in life I don’t like the major I’m in and I really don’t know what I can see myself doing for the rest of my life.  I feel lost and hopeless meanwhile it’s others my age enjoying life making way more money than I ever will. I don’t want to kill myself but it’s plenty of days I don’t want to be here and to cope with that I smoke weed extremely heavy but recently I’m losing this fight.
