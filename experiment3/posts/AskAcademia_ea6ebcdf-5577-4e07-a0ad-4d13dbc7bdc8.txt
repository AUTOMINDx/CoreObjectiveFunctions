Academic Twitter: came for networking, left with worsened mental health issues
I joined Twitter a couple years ago because I heard it was a good way to network, make connections, etc. So I made an "academic" Twitter account. At first it seemed helpful. Maybe part of that was that I joined at the beginning of the pandemic and it seemed so much easier at the time to make remote connections with people. But over time it has just become a very depressing place. I do follow people not in academia, but even academics are tweeting 90% of the time about how awful and scary covid is. I'm aware of that and I've spent this whole pandemic trying to control my terrible anxiety and depression about this whole situation. Every time I think "I will not go read a depressing thing on Twitter, only find an academic thing to do" I fail. Every time. My feed is just constantly full of depressing things I don't want to read about. I feel drained every time I go on there to do the occasional Tweet about something related to my studies. It also seems like nobody even engages with my Tweets so I don't feel like I'm actually getting much out of it anymore other than following/being followed by people in my field.

Maybe this is more of a rant, but is there anything I can do to make this a better experience? Or should I just give up? I don't seem to do well on social media. I had to get rid of my Facebook account because I found it too stressful.
