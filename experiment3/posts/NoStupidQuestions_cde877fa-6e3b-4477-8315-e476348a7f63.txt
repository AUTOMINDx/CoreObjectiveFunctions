Do people who speak languages with masculine and feminine words have to actively think about the "the" that they are putting in front of a word, or does it come naturally?
Considering a lot of native English speakers mix up they're, their, and there, do a lot of Spanish or French speakers mix up the "le" or "la" they're putting in front of table or "chambre" and how is it viewed if you do mix it up?

edit: why is there so much nutella discourse
