Obesity and gerd
So i am 19 years old and i have 115 kilograms(230 pounds).my bmi is 36 and im considered obese. I only recently noticed that i have  gerd even though i have been getting warning symptoms for 4 months like heartburn and constant burping. About a month ago i felt food sticking in my throat and thats what made me go to get checked.i went to my gi and he diagnosed me with gerd and prescribed rabeoprazole and gaviscon. He also told me to stay clear of sodas,coffee,cigarettes, and all other common  triggers and im following his advice. My symptoms are getting better but i think the cause of my reflux is my weight. This problem provides a good amount of motivation for losing weight and im determined to see how it goes (i already lost 10 pounds or 5 kilograms but plan to go all the way to normal weight). So i have a question will losing weight help with my gerd.



P.s i had a similar symptoms in 2019 when i was 113 kilograms but i managed to lose them while losing weight but due to covid lockdowns i got that weight back and now the symptoms are worse.
