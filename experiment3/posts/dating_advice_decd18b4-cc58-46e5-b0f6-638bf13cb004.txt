Boyfriend doesn’t care if I cheat
I’ve been dating this guy for a while, and my friends told me he was cheating on me. I asked him and he said yes. Turns out it was all a joke to scare me. He then later said he was mad at me for asking if he was cheating on me.
I said that he would ask me the same thing if someone told him I was cheating on him. His response was “no I wouldn’t, I’m not a jealous person”. We broke up because I felt that was just him saying he didn’t care enough about the relationship or me. I want to know if I was right or if I should have looked at it from a different view. One of his best friends is a girl who he flirts with all the time but she has a boyfriend, am I crazy to think he was just dating me until he could be with her.
