Anyone else awkward and basically a different person around their family?
I don’t get it. My family is amazing, I have absolutely no complaints about any of them. But for some reason when I’m around them I turn from my usual outgoing self to some shy awkward shell of a human who hovers around completely mute.

I realized this a long time ago but what sparked my idea to write this post and maybe find others who feel the same and possible find solutions to work on is today, I was driving my mom home from my aunts house and she had some stuff with her. My cars a 2 door so I assumed she would put it in the trunk but I zoned out and she got in the passenger seat, moved it back to reveal the back seats and that’s when she noticed a box of condoms on the ground under the seat.

She actually laughed about it. My parents are super chill and she obviously noticed I was uncomfortable and tried to reassure me that it’s fine. Objectively speaking I know it’s fine. I’m an 18 year old male and it’s not like it was heroin or something. There was nothing wrong with it, but for some reason I still want to literally hang myself by my neck.

It’s almost like my family perceiving me in any way makes me uncomfortable. Im 18 and they obviously know I’m not completely abstinent or some shit but the pure fact that she has now seen those in my possession is making my brain feel itchy. I don’t like sharing my interests, my music taste, anything, it all just makes me super uncomfortable and I envy my friends who are close with their families so incredibly badly.
