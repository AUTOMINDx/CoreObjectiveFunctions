How do you suppress the feelings of doubt or sadness late at night?
I don't always, but sometimes I feel a sense of doubt. Failure. Maybe questioning, or reckoning about the choices I've made thus far. Generally, I enjoy my life, and what I'm doing. But sometimes, it eats at me. Late at night. Like right now. I'll never be famous. I'll never have a job in my degree I graduated with. How do I stop these feelings?
