Drug dealer approached me and asked, if needed, if he could hide in my house
Today I was approached by a neighbour of mine, I was on my way to work and he asked if we could talk. Since I do not trust strangers at all, I told him that I was late for work, and he asked just 5 minutes or if anyone that.
And I stayed. Since I did not know what a grown-up man would want with a teenager, I was very careful with his approach. His tone wasn't aggressive or demanding, just slightly desperate and distressed. Seeing that I was being careful with him, he said he wouldn't even open the gate as a reassurance that he wouldn't do anything to me besides talking.

He said "hey, I do some bad things and, if I need, can I please jump over to your house?" I know he does sell some kind of drugs cause the smell travels over to my house and it's absolutely unbearable sometimes.

I answered that I wasn't of legal age and wouldn't want to get involved. He asked to talk to my mom instead.

Since it happened this morning, I am yet to hear what happened on my mom's side, but what should I do? I don't plan on getting involved with him, but I don't feel safe at home anymore knowing he can jump over if something goes wrong.
