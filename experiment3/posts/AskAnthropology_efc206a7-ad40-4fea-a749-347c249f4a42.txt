What are some of the main ideas surrounding the origin of the belief in God?
The title pretty much says it all. Some reading material would also be appreciated.

I've only ever heard of tendentious and polemically-motivated theories about the origin of belief in God, like ignorance about science, etc. but it seems obvious that this, even if true as a contributing factor, is too simplistic an analysis.
