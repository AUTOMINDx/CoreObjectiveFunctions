How do you do interviews while also working full time?
Obviously don't want current employer to know I'm looking. How do you book interviews during the work day, for example? I guess just take time off and say it's medical or personal. Also how do you hide interview attire? I'll be going into work on Monday in a skirt, blouse and cardigan - totally not what I normally wear bc I'll commute to interview straight from work. 

How did you manage interviews, working and hiding the fact that you were looking? Any advice is appreciated :)
