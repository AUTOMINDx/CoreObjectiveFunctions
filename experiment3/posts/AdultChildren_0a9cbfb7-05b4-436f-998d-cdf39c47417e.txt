Im (21M) about to confront my alcoholic dad(50) for the first time, any advice?
Hi,

my  father has been struggling alot with his alcohol consumption in the  past two years. Recently it became alot worse and now hes a high  functioning alcoholic. He manages to get his job done but started coming  home very drunk recently.

When he  is home he talks to himself, makes weird noises (screams etc.) and  randomly says insults (while we dont know if hes insulting us or whom).  Its draining my mental health heavily, eventhough he wasnt violent so  far, thank god.

I want to talk to  him privately and offer him my help and support (not enabling, of  course), while pointing out issues and consequences of his AUD.  My main  concern is that we never had a particular good father-son bond so im  concerened hes just gonna judge my offer to talk or just walk away.

Any tips or experiences on how to handle this?

TL;DR:  Father became high functioning alcoholic; comes home insults but no  physical violence; im mentally drained and want to talk and need tips.
