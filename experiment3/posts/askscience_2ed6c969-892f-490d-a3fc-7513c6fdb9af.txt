Why is Omicron considered a variant, rather than a novel coronavirus?
I'm no expert, but from what I read it seems that the omicron variant has different symptoms and little-to-no shared immunity. At what point is it just a new coronavirus like the other coronaviruses in the world as opposed to a variant of Covid-19?
