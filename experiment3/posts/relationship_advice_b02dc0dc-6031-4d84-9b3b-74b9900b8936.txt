My (19f) BF (18m) cried because we cuddled
We’ve been dating for about a month and I’m his first girlfriend, so very nervous, easily flustered and wants to take things slow which I find cute.

We were at my house and I asked him if he wanted to lay in bed and cuddle, nervously he said yes. He has never really been touched before and I like cuddling and not being cuddled.

So we lay down and get him on his side, slightly under me and his head on my chest (back and head scratches of course). And I can tell he really needed it and he starting crying, which is perfectly fine, it’s okay to be emotional but he got really embarrassed.

Just worried he will be embarrassed every time he cries or will be too embarrassed to cry or show emotions again. 

(P.S. show your boy more love I promise you they need it.)
