Traveling at the speed of light
Hi, so i have been thinking about this for a while and i might be stupid or somethig but i have some questions about traveling at the speed of light and relevent things

1- lets say we have a giant cube wich is diffrent color on each side and its lenght is 5 light years if we roate this cube and look at it with a telescope the end should not be turned yet (because it take 5 years for light to reach) but what if we look at its middle(not the exact middle) like every one light second what would be like how does it rotate with delay(in our sight)

2-if a spaceship lives earth at the speed of light to destenetion of 1 light year what would be see from earth? it take the ship one year to reach there and we are seeing it as it goes away but after one year they jsut reach there and it take extra one year for its light ro rach us (maybe i explained it a little bad, sorry!) so help me out here, WHAT WILL WE SEE

3- is if a spaceship goes towards lets say a star that is actually dead but its light hasnt reached us yet ( like 5 light years away for example) when the ship is going at the speed of light the time aroud them should stop right?(correct me if im wrong) but what will they see when reaching the star? it cant be still like they go throw the light photons instaed of them coming towards them? and if the ship is going faster than light wich the time should go backwards(Correct me if im worng again) but that would make they vision of star fast forwarded as tey are getting closer to it

4 - and my last question (for now) is when a ship travels at the speed of light the time will stop for them( you know what!) so if i would think that the earth and its people will be frozebn for them and when they stop time will go back to normal for them? wich in earth sight they moved there instantly?

sorry if had spelling or grammer issue OR if im stupid or something
