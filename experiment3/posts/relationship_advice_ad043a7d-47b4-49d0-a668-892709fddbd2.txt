Iâ€™m fed up with the BS
So my boyfriend is into psychedelic drugs and probably for as long as weâ€™ve been together he always suggest that I do a drug called mushrooms or shrooms. I told him every single time that Iâ€™m not interested in psychedelic drugs or any substances and he always gives me a hard time because of it. On the contrary Iâ€™m totally OK with him doing any kind of drug CORRECTION. a safe drug that can help him emotionally or mentally but me personally Iâ€™m not OK with any Hallucinogenics or psychedelic drugs. Just recently he gave me a hard time because I told him once again that Iâ€™m not interested in doing mushrooms. What do you guys think because at this point Iâ€™m ready to break up with him because he doesnâ€™t except my thoughts and ideas on things he seems like he doesnâ€™t care about how I feel about things.

UPDATE! I left him and honestly I feel like I did the right thing.. I read some of the comments. (I didnâ€™t expect so many lol but thank you all for your honesty) and my mind was made. I deserve to be treated like my thoughts and opinions matter. ðŸ’–
