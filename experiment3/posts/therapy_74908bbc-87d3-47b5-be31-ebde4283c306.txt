I THINK I FOUND THE THERAPIST IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
so for staters i have had two therapists that seems to act more like a friend. When i talk they twnd to just agree , say “ i know its tough” “that must be hard”. In short i keep talking and not really getting anything out of it. I could talk to a friend for free and get the same treatment/reaction.
My new therapist im excite about her plans. She said she is an actionary therapist , she will give me practical tools to navigate life. First session and she already gave
me assignment. I feel hopeful
