I feel programmed.
With my short term memory issues, focus issues, blank mind. (Brain fog i guess) i feel dumb and slow. Feels like i always question what i do and can’t understand what people are saying. My actions don’t feel like mine, I’m convinced that i died and someone stupid took over my body. A fake copy. Don’t know if anything is real.
