My nightmares have gotten really strange as more time has passed since my traumatic events
I won’t put any detail in this post, I’ll keep it as vague as possible to respect people’s triggers (and honestly my own too because talking about it is very difficult for me today). I’ve been dealing with PTSD from traumatic events stemming from about 5 years ago, but as more time passes, the nightmares are different. They aren’t like I’m reliving my trauma, but sometimes it is, but the perpetrator is someone else, often someone I love and trust. I’ll also have nightmares where the event happens again in a new and future context, for example last night I had a nightmare that I got a new psychiatrist who ended up hurting me in the same way as what happened in my past. Does anyone else experience this kind of thing? It confuses me and almost hurts me more than the nightmares of the actual traumatic situation.
