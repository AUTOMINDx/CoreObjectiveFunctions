Why so pathetic
My father does things like scream at the top of his lungs, throw and break everything in the house, over things like “WHERES THE FUCKING PEANUT BUTTER” he also reallyyyyyy hates when we buy the wrong kind of Mayo. He does this nightly. Tonight he decided to scream and break everything while my sick 9month old was throwing up all night (we don’t live here we’re visiting so my mom can help out). I seriously just wonder how anyone can be so pathetic. Everything he does angers and triggers me. The burping, the loud chewing and lip smacking, the talking to himself. I think he’s getting dementia at this point but how could you tell when the person is drunk 24 hours a day.
