My dad and I (23M)don’t really talk much and I don’t have an older siblings , But what fatherly/sibling advice would you give a guy who’s really really behind in life like me? Please I just feel like giving up
I’m just beyond exhausted I’m trying yet so behind in life. To start of I’m 23 M 5’6 overweight and a virgin. I’ve always tried hard but not shown enough value and have never really had good friendships. I’ve been going to therapy and working out and eating clean to help me look better mentally and physically and create worth as potential friend and Partner. I also am still a virgin, and most guys my age sleep with 20+ women. I’m in grad school as well cause I wanna have a good living and take care of my folks. I’m just so behind socially, romantically, success wise, physically.Help?
