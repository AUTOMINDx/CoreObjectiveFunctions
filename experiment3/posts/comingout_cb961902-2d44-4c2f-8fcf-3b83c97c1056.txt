I did the thing (well sorta) [UPDATE]
About a week ago I made a post here talking about how I want to come out, and I'm happy to say that I've just told my best friend I'm gay. Originally I wanted to tell him in person but I got kinda scared about it and didn't feel like it was the right time so I texted him afterwards instead. Long story short, we texted back and forth a bit and he is being super supportive about it and already suggested coming out to my parents as well (without pressure though), and I'm honestly just extremely happy and relieved about the fact that I now have someone close to me that I can talk to. Next step is gonna be telling my parents, but I still have to figure out how I'm gonna do that. For now I can sleep well knowing there's people that care about me. Can't remember the last time I genuinely felt this good.

Just wanted to share my progress and say thank you to everyone who encouraged me.
