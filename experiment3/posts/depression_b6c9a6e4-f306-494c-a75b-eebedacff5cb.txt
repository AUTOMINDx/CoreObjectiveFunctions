Is this self harm? (Might be nsfw i dunno)
I dunno, everybody thinks of self harm as cutting yourself and shit like that. But is smacking yourself in the head when you're enraged count? I get really pissed off sometimes and do that. I also end up doing it when I feel like a fucking idiot. I guess it would count but I really don't know.
