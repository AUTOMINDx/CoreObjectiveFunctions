I (20M) wanted to go to medical school, but I'm having my doubts
Hey all,

I've pushed very hard since high school to go into medicine, and particularly towards getting into medical school. Prior to college, I got my EMT and I now work part time with a private ambulance company. 

I have experience working with 2 undergraduate labs, a 3.9+ GPA, experience volunteering and being president of a club dedicated to a cause I care very deeply about. I'm currently a junior majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering and I've decided to take an extra year (with financial and scholarship assistance) to get a second degree in Philosophy.

I thought that working as an EMT and an undergraduate researcher would help me decide if medicine was the career for me, but I'm still no closer to figuring it out.  I spent some time talking with EMS workers and physicians, and I have been concerned by high levels of burnout, with some physicians going so far as to say they wouldn't choose their career if they had to do it all over again. Since I've started college, I've started valuing work-life balance significantly more than I used to, and would prefer to go into a field which respects my time and work, and preferably working around 40 hours a week.

Outside of medicine, I've been generally interested in electrical engineering in sustainability, teaching in high school, actually working in Biomedical Engineering, or even becoming a Physician's Assistant. I've also been intrigued by becoming a lecturer or professor of ethics or engineering, but I'm similarly concerned by the burnout, stress, and lack of work-life balance prevalent in this field.

I could continue working with the private ambulance company through the summer, but I'm starting to feel claustrophobic and wondering if I should expand my scope.

How do I know which path is right for me?
