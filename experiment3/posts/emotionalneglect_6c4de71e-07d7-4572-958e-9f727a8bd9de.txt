Does anyone else’s parent pretend that anything they did that upsets you never happened?
Noticed my parents have this habit where they start fights with me, hold a grudge for a while and ignore me, then they try to make me look like I’m the one who’s starting drama when they want to “talk to me” again. Except they never genuinely want to talk, they simply know I’m upset and try to make me look bad because I’m not in my general good mood, which affects my tone and demeanor. Then they use this against me to make me seem like I have an issue with them, and start more drama where they can continue victimizing themselves, if this makes sense. Does anyone else’s parent pretend that anything they did that upsets you never happened?
 

Worse part is whenever I attempt to acknowledge the elephant in the room they continue to play oblivious and act like I’m overreacting. They then redirect the conversation to my post-fight behavior to take the conversation off the fact that they ignore me, or vented about me loudly enough for me to hear them for hours, or do small stupid things to show they are upset with me, making me upset. 

Wondering if anyone experienced anything similar because I dont know if I’m overreacting or if this is just how emotionally abusive parents behave in fights.
