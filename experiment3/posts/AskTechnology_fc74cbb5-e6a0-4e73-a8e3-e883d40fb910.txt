should I upgrade to windows 11?
Hi I saw that my computer can be upgraded to windows 11 but I want to make sure it is safe.  
This is my computer : [https://www.userbenchmark.com/System/HP-ENVY-x360-Convertible-13-ar0xxx/144498](https://www.userbenchmark.com/System/HP-ENVY-x360-Convertible-13-ar0xxx/144498) and if you believe the new features are worth it

it kinda looks like a big deal so I dont want to just rush the update button
