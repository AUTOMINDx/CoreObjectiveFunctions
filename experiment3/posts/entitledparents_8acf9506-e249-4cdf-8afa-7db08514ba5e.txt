Entitled mom wants us to kick out the father of her grandchild.
Hello all, Im back with more dramatic tales from the medical world. Please excuse my absence.

Once again, I am a non-clinical employee. For the sake of anonymity, I will say only that I am somewhere among admission and registration. A desk lady, if you will.

Right now, the restrictions we have set up for the Labor and Delivery Unit, is that an individual going up to give birth is allowed to have ONE support person. It can be the patient’s mom, father of the child, friend, whoever. They may also have a doula or midwife. But once the procedure has started, there is absolutely no switching out of any kind.

A woman strolled up to the main entrance of our hospital, and requested to see her daughter “Jane Smith” (fake name). We looked up Jane Smith, to find that she was literally in the middle of the birthing procedure. Did a quick call to nursing staff, and they confirmed that the father of the child was already up there. We informed the soon-to-be grandmother of our policy, and that since the father of the child was already up there, she would not be allowed up to the unit. However if she wanted to wait, she could stay in our lobby until her daughter was taken to the post-delivery unit. She had a melt-down.

She insisted that as she was the patient’s mother (patient was well into adulthood btw), she had every right to witness the birth, this is her first grandchild, and **demanded that we escort the father out so she could go up**. Yes, you read that correctly. We flat out told her that we *absolutely* would not be doing that, and if she tried to bypass us and get up to the floor, we would *absolutely* be calling security on her. *Of course*, more hysterics ensued, and *of course* she threatened to sue all of us. For what exactly, I am not sure. I’ll get back to you on that. But thats not all. She actually took out her phone, and tried to call her daughter (who was still actively giving birth).

After getting sent to voicemail a couple times, she stood off to the side and “cried”. Once she realized that none of us were paying attention to her, she turned off her waterworks, and stormed out of the building. We could hear her shouting into the air that she was “sick of being treated like this”, and how ungrateful her daughter is.

My director heard the screaming, and came by later to ask what happened. I told them exactly what the women said, and all my director did was laugh and go back to their office.

**TL;DR**- a grandma was not able to make someone else’s birth about herself, and she lost her entire mind about it. Also, apparently we are going to be sued.
