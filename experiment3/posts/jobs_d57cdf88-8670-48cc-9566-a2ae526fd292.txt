How do I tolerate a coworker who doesn't leave me alone?
I started a job at a dealership about a month ago and it's pretty good except for this one guy. I work with him most directly as we have the same job. He treats me as if I've got some kind of disability and constantly tells me the same things I already know. He'll follow me around like a puppy and demand I announce simple things like going to the bathroom. I can work with a partner but not like this. He talks to me like I'm stupid or something. I've tried to hint at him to stop but he doesn't get it. People that don't even work here but are here often notice. The guy literally doesn't treat anyone else like this. He constantly screws things up and will just blame it on me. He's horrifically lazy. I'm considering looking for a different job. How can I deal with him?
