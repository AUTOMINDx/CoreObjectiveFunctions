How do i handle a insecure gf?
My gf is insecure like we been dating for 8 months, i do love her yeah but shes so insecure and her insecurities cause issues and arguments. Everytime i force her to cough up why shes sad at me when she gives me the 1 worded silent treatment its always "my ex did this and that , it reminded me of what my ex did", also getting mad at me when some girl did something minor to me. Its like im not gonna leave her because she is a good girl but these insecurities are so annoying.

I always try to explain to her that being mad insecure causes a lot of arguments but she hits me with the "i dont wanna be lectured", "i just dont feel like talking", 1 words. What the hell do i do in this situation?

EDIT: She just said shes not ok with me having female friends outside my family even doe i dont even pay girls any attention. This is what i mean

EDIT 2: Calmed her down basically seeing how it goes, told her shes being controlling and hyprocritical. And i reassured and told her she dont really have to worry ab girls cuz im cold to them

EDIT 3: How do I get her to talk about insecurities and jealousy but her response is always "i dont feel like talking about this stuff"

EDIT 4: Were good now she realised and she gonna stop
