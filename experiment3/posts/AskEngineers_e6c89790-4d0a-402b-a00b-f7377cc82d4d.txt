Engineers, are you happy? I’ve been wanting to go to school for mechanical engineering for about a year. I was a volunteer firefighter but I don’t think it fits. I want to make things and I love my job as a mechanic.
Edit- all, words cannot describe the immense help all of your comments have meant to me. I take each one to heart and use them all to help weigh my decision. Thank you for taking the time from your day to respond.
