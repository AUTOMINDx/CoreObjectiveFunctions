Free Training on CompTIA A+ Full Course
Hi everyone,

I'm currently delivering free training on the full CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 18 modules and I created a dedicated video for each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since each video covers a whole module after all.

I added time stamps in each video for you convenience if your only looking for something specific in a module or only want to refresh on a certain topic so please feel free to make use of them.

There will be 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules with the actual course.

The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+ and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course.

If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online.

Here is the course intro
