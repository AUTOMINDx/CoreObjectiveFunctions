Embarrassing question inside. Not for reading while eating. Please be warned.
I’m so embarrassed by this question. Please be warned that it is gross. 

I was taking a bowel movement when I noticed something dangling. I used a tissue paper and pulled it out and it fell on the side of the toilet bowl so I was able to have a close look and take a picture (which I won’t post unless it is needed or a doctor can message me for the picture).

It was long, I’d say at least 12cm long. 

It’s top section, about 2cm, was thicker than the rest of it. And at its end, it looked like it divided into multiple strands. 

I looked up tapeworm online and it didn’t look like that but I could be wrong. 

Some background information:
I do eat sushi from time to time
I’m a 33 year old female. I am underweight, but have been for all my life. I’m 5’5” and am about 106 pounds. I remember when I was maybe 6 I did have tapeworm that I had to have antibiotics for. 
I feel like it’s hard for me to gain weight. But honestly that could be because my appetite has always been bad, not very interested in food. 
I also do feel weak and tired sometimes but I always thought it’s because I’m underweight. 

Never noticed anything in my bowel movements before that was strange until today. It freaked me out. 

I rather ask here first than go to a doctor honestly.

Edit:
Here is the forbidden picture. [deleted] Will delete later 😩

Edit 2: MYSTERY SOLVED

I was just eating the left over Asian food from yesterday and noticed the bean shoots. It looks exactly like what I found in the toilet! Yesterday when I was eating it, I wasn’t really paying attention but today I did. I just lost my appetite though when I made the connection. Will delete that nasty picture up above soon. Good to know I don’t have wormies in me!
