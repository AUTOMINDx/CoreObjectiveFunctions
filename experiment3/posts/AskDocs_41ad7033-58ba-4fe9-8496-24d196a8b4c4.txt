Would calling the ambulance in this case do any good for my sister?
I'm F18 62kg and 165cm but this isn't a question about me i just don't know how much my sister weighs and it wouldn't let me post without it.
My sister is 20years old, she's extremely underweight, she eats nothing, her skin is gray,she gets dizzy very often, she's very shaky all the time and she has red spots everywhere.
She doesn't wanna get help and doesn't wanna eat anything, i don't want her to die.
I don't know how this works so i came here to ask, would it work if i call the ambulance to come pick her up so she can stay in the hospital and recover? I don't know what else to do.
Her weight is not a mistery, it's very obvious, i can see her bones and it terrifies me. 
Please help me.
Should i do this? can i call someone else for her? Will the ambulance decline this?
