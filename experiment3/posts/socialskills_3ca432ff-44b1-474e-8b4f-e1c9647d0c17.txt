How come boys don’t like girls?
I’m 21 years old and pretty social, but I have a boyfriend so I am not flirty or looking for romantic attention. Whenever I am in a conversation with a boy or group of boys without other girls present, it’s like navigating a completely different terrain. They normally operate under the assumption that I’m dumb or stupid and I find myself having to defend myself or getting made fun of a lot in these situations, and that’s them being nice. Normally, boys don’t even have the desire to converse with me at all. 
I am pretty feminine and do like to talk about/engage with girly things, so I understand to an extent just having different interests. But how do I get boys to talk to me normal and friendly without just simply asking them questions the whole time or getting made fun of?
