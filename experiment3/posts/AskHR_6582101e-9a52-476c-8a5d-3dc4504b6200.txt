To update- on Monday I spoke with my boss the very first thing in the morning at 730AM. He confirmed the wife had sent emails with my "sexts" in them and that they were "uncomfortable". He also informed me they had been sent to a lot of people in the organization and that it had already been forwarded on to HR. 

I immediately reached out to HR to report the incident, and the harassment. The manager informed me that they were aware of the incident (they did not know I knew it had already been sent to them).  The manager of HR informed me it would be handled by "Work Environment" investigators and that I would be hearing from the investigator on Tuesday, due to the person who was doing the investigation being out of office until then. While I do NOT trust HR, the vibe was friendly and supportive (but I also know that's their job; I am not wearing rose colored glasses). 

On Tuesday morning I met with an employment lawyer (I paid for a consultation). He informed me he did not think that I would lose my job but to keep in touch with him. He also said that what the wife did was not illegal though it was a super crappy thing to do. He also said he didn't know how much of a case I would have moving forward due to Texas being an "at will state". He told me to call him after meeting with HR and to let him know how that went. 

When I got home from that meeting I got a call from the HR investigator and she told me she would be sending me an appointment notice by close of business on Tuesday to set up time to speak. 

Well that never happened. I never received a calendar appointment to speak to her. 

It's now the end of day on Wednesday (one day after the convo with the lawyer and brief call with HR) and I have not heard a thing from HR. I'm becoming increasingly paranoid and worried and suffering severe anxiety because of it. 

Looking to hear people's thoughts on this situation now that there is an update. 

Thank you all so much for the advice and support.
