Keto diet cured my GERD/gastritis
I had painful and diagnosed GERD/gastritis for over a year, bloating, heartburn, weird bowel movements; and so I tried basically eating nothing but chicken and water for a month, and all my symptoms went away. I can now happily say I’ve been back to eating normally (whatever I want) for over a year since then and never had any gastritis issues since.

If you’re like me by February you could be free of GERD/gastritis.

I hope this helps someone who is suffering.

Edit: Since people are asking, I would have almost exclusively chicken drumsticks, made in an air fryer. I would marinate them beforehand for taste. I would make chicken breast sometimes too.

Edit 2: For everyone telling me this isn’t an “ideal diet” that’s fine. I am just sharing what worked for me. I chose a strict diet Bc I knew if I deviated off it I would probably just slip into eating the same things again. It was for a month or two, and cured an illness that effected me for over a year.
