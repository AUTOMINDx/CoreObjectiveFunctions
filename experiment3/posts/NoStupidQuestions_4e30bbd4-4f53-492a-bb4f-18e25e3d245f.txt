Do people still masturbate the older they get?
So I had a thought today, do most people just stop masturbating at a certain age like 30s, 40s, 50s etc. 

You always hear of couples not having time for sex. Does the same thing apply to individuals as you get older?

Edit: removed the word ‘older’ from couples as people are assuming 30s, 40s, 50s is old.
