Is it just me when I say it actually doesn’t feel like Christmas this year?
I know people say this EVERY year so I don’t want to ask this question. But genuinely Christmas is in 3 days and it still feels like November. This isn’t normal and I have never felt this way. I always get a bit “festive” in December but I don’t feel any different. The christmas tree in my living room makes me feel nothing. That is not normal whatsoever. Normally when I look at that stupid fucking tree Christmas spirit fills me. But when I look at it now I can’t say that.
