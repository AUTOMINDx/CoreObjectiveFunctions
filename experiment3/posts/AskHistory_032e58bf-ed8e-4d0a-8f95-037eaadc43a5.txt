What is a lesser known piece of disturbing history that you wish you could forget, but can't?
For me, I wish I could forget about Nazino Island in the former Soviet Union. Those poor people had to endure the worst parts of humanity, and it really disturbs me to this day. Of course, understanding these types of events is necessary to prevent them from happening again, but I kind of wish I didn't know about the atrocities of Nazino Island, or maybe I wish it wouldn't affect me the way it does.

So, what are some historical events you wish you didn't know?
