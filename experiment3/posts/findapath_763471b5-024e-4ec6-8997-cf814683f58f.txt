I need to get out of Teaching.

I cannot do this anymore. Lack of administrator support, unreasonable job expectations, and horrid student behavior. Every day I spent 8-10 hours absolutely miserable, stressed, depressed, and anxious in my classroom to the point where my homelife is also affected. 

My wife and I moved to this city 3 years ago because she had a wonderful job opportunity and has experienced success and promotions at her job. While genuinely happy for her, I have spent the last three years in a rough inner city school district. Breaking up daily fights, dealing with destructive students, having to pay for my own supplies without guarantee of reimbursement, and regularly having to complete work outside of contracted hours just to get the bare minimal done. I am tired. 

I will miss the schedule. Having summers off and being able to leave pre-rush hour has been nice. It will be tough to give up my summers now that I have a child, but I feel like the trade off of feeling satisfied with my career would also translate to a happier and more energetic homelife. 

Typing this post is a low point for me and I thank you for reading this far. It is sad because I think in the right conditions I could thrive as a teacher. My current location and the post-COVID student behavior has ruined something I used to love. 

Stats that may help your suggestions:  
29M  
Bachelor of Business Admin (Marketing)  
Full-time Teaching License  
Social Studies certification  
Art certification  
I can draw, paint, and am good with crafting/building things.  
I am extroverted and don't mind talking to others or in front of a crowd.
