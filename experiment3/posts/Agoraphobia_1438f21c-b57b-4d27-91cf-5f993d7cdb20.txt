What’s the first thing you want to do or hobby you want to rekindle once you can get yourself out of the house?
I want to go thrifting and antique mall shopping. I miss leaving the house to go sifting and looking for treasures.

It’s not just agoraphobia that limits me but also pain issues, so my stamina while shopping is next to none. 

I used to be able to hit up so many stores in a day. Now I’m lucky if I can force myself out the door only to sit in the parking lot and convince myself to go back home.

I also want to take my kid with me eventually. She’s too little now. But I’d love to share that experience with her eventually so this is a goal of mine for the near future.

What do you want to do?
