How common is it for men to stick random objects up their ass when jerking off?
I'm having an arguement with a friend, don't want to explain how we got there but this dude thinks my family and upbringing was prudish because I didn't stick a fucking garden hose up my ass when I first started masturbating.

I just want a general inquiry on this, that is all.
