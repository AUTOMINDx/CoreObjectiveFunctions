What can I do about my friends objectification/degradation of women?
Hi! I've been hanging out with my friends recently and I've noticed that they treat women awfully, eg they "rate" them from a scale of 1 - 10, talk about getting laid, and generally reduce women to nothing but a sex object, and it just makes me sick. One of them is practically an Incel and views any woman who doesn't want to immediately bed him as an awful human being. Now for some context I am a male teenager and so are they, but I just can't stand it anymore. Whenever I challenge them on their ideas they essentially just act as if I'm being "uptight" or a "snowflake" and I just feel so powerless. What's the best course of action and what can I do to make genuine change within my friend group? Thanks!
