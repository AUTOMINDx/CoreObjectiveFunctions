Is anti-aging a serious scientific field?
I occasionally hear about research being done, intended to analyse WHY exactly living beings age and decay, until they inevitably die, and what can be done to either halt or severely slow down the process.

Is this quackery/wishful thinking, or is there a chance that this could be cracked within our lifetimes?
