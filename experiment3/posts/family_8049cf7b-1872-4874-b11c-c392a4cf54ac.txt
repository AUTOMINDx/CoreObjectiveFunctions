My stepdaughter (F17) does not want to be friends with her childhood best friend (F17) anymore and for no apparent reason. but the friend doesn't seem to get the hint and keeps trying to hang out with her. And I'm in the middle!
I (F36) think it's really sad because they were once best friends and her friend was almost like a second daughter to me! she keeps wanting to come over to our house and it's awkward because my SD just ignores her and is kinda rude to her when she comes over. I'm the one stuck entertaining her and making excuses for my stepdaughter on why she can't hang out with her. i don't want to hurt her feelings and tell her the truth. i've known that kid since she was 8 yrs old and she is like family to me. she still wants to come
over and visit me but it's sooo
awkward when SD doesn't want her there.
what should I do?
