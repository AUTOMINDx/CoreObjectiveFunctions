Remote vs in office salary?
Hey there! 

Would you take a sizable pay cut to work remote? 

I have two job offers, one is fully remote at 85k and the other is in office at 130k in an expensive area (dc). I don’t have any debt and have saved up around 50k cash so money is always a factor but I am not hurting by any means. I’ve lived in dc for a while and like the area but am in Florida right now and you really can’t beat the beach and 70 degrees all winter. What would you do and why?
