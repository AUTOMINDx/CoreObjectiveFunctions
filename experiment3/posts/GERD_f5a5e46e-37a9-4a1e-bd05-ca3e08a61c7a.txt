After having horrible reflux for 5 years... it's gone after quitting drinking.
It's really weird for it to be gone and I keep waiting for it to return, but I am enjoying coffee, salsa, pizza etc... It seems my gerd was caused by binge drinking alcohol for years and since quitting about a month ago, it appears to be gone. I  also started a PPI, Prilosec in this time so that may be it too. I am thinking of taking the PPI for another month and then easing off to see if it still is gone. So, if you're drinking alcohol, cut it out and see if you improve. Seems like a simple solution, but addiction is never simple.
