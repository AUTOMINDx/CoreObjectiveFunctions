Men, do you ever worry that a woman is only going on dates with you for the free food/drinks/entertainment?
Disclaimer: This question is from a curious woman, not an angry man! 

Have you ever dated a woman/women and been concerned you’re simply used for the food, drinks, entertainment that comes with dates?

If so, what are your red flags that this is the case? What can a woman do to prove it’s not? (Beyond the obvious paying for some things)
