Something I think gets overlooked…
Hi! I (f21) was officially diagnosed with anxiety around the time when the pandemic started, but tbh I think it’s been going on a lot longer than that. The way my doctor described it is we are all a pot of boiling water and once something happens (a thought, event, etc.) it causes the pot to boil over. Ever since I was a young child I have been a worrier and although worrying about things is a normal part of life, I didn’t know my obsessive thoughts were actually a symptom of something larger. Getting to the point of this post, also something I didn’t realize was that these thoughts and the ever-increasing anxiety showcased itself through physical symptoms, such as migraines, digestive issues, etc. I can’t tell you the number of times I have induced a panic attack by thinking about the physical symptoms my anxiety produced and just as a note: don’t use google, it will always tell you that you’re dying. Anyways, I just want those who experience this never-ending worry to know that you’re not alone and if you have any tips to deal with physical symptoms, please drop them below.
