Did anyone else not like ACA or Al-anon meetings?
Maybe it’s the groups I tried or maybe I’m just an insensitive asshole but I tried both groups multiple times and it never stuck. 

The main reason I would stop was because I felt like people were getting competitive with their trauma. I’m a self identified over-sharer so talking about trauma really doesn’t affect me. But it felt like every time someone shared something that happened to them someone else would chimed in with how they went through the same thing but slightly worse or more traumatic. Very little time was spent actually comforting or validating the original story teller. It would be like if you told someone your grandpa died of cancer and instead of saying I’m so sorry for your loss they followed with my grandpa died in a car accident and it was so awful because it was sudden and unexpected… It felt like everyone was one uping one another and no one was truly empathetic or offering advice or steps to help that person process and work through that trauma. It made me not want to share and I typically stayed quiet which is why I gave up.
