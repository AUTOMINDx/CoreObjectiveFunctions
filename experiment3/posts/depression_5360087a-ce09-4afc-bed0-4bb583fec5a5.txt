Working makes me depressed.
I'm sure im not the only one but work exhausts me. I come home and i just go to bed because i cant fathom doing anything else. When i quit my job and moved in with my mom my depression disappeared. This seems to be a theme with me. If i have too many things to do everyday i just fall apart until i just lay in bed all day not eating or doing anything but if im left to do only as much as i feel i can do (which is pathetically little) I feel happy. Im not entirely sure what the point of my post is but i have been reflecting over it for a while now and i just seem to have very little mental energy for anything and when that energy is continously exhausted i become depressed not caring about anything. I tried cbt but the tasks overwhelmed me and made everything worse until i didnt do the tasks and just felt guilty for not doing the tasks which makes the depression worse.
