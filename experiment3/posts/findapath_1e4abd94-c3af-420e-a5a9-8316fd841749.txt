What does it feel like to like what you do?
I am currently trying to figure out things I like/don't like (professionally and um just in my life) after many years of being taught that you should just *like* things or just always be grateful to be in the room. I am realizing I don't like various things about my job. But I am also not really sure how to know what I do like (professionally speaking).

 I know some people out there like what they do and I want to know - what does it feel like to like your job? What kind of thoughts do you have about your job? And, maybe this is a little woowoo but how does it feel in your body to like your job? Feel free to share what you do if that feels relevant but mainly i just want to know how people know they like what they do ðŸ˜…
