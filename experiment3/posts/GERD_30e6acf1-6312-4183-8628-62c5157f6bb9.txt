Anyone else have *constant* chest pressure?
Hi y’all, I had my endoscopy and was officially diagnosed with GERD and IBS yesterday, actually. But the chest pressure/tightness has been more or less consistent for the past month and a half (alongside other typical GERD/GI symptoms). I went to urgent care and they listened to my heart/gave me a chest X-ray about a month ago, and they said everything looked normal and it was probably acid reflux and anxiety. Is this symptom caused by my GERD? I’m starting PPIs and am going to try fixing my diet, which will hopefully help, but I hate feeling like this. It pretty much feels like someone is sitting on my chest 24/7.
