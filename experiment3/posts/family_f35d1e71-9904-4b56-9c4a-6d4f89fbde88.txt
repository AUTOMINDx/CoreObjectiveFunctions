Parents smoking ruining our relationship
My parents have been smokers even before I was born. Now that I’m 21, they still smoke. They smoke at least a pack a day… it’s bad. They can’t be in the car for more than 20 mins they have to get out and smoke. Ive always expressed to them I wish they would quit because the smell really bothers me and I want them to be healthy. But they just don’t try. Unfortunately the smoking itself and their attitude about it makes me not want to spend time with them. The smells revolt me, even if it’s on their skin and clothes and they’re not actively smoking in front of me, I feel like I’m going to be sick. I’m home from school on Christmas break now, and me and my mom had a long nice chat about stuff, and she asked if I want to come watch Netflix with her. So I said sure, we don’t do stuff like that often. But then she goes outside and has a smoke, and comes back in and the smell is making me feel sick. So now we’re not watching Netflix and we’re sitting in separate rooms. Am I a bad person for distancing myself like this? I’ve had a pulmonary embolism in the past. One of the causes of blood clots in the lungs can be from smoking (I’m not a smoker). But because of this I take extra caution not to be around second hand smoke. I just feel bad because I feel like I’m wasting time I could be spending with my parents, but I don’t want to because I’m angry and grossed out by the cigarette smoke. Honestly just feeling sad right now and don’t know what to do.
