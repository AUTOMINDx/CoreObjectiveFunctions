I don't feel any type of emotional connection to anyone close to me.
I'm writing this post because I want to see if anyone else feels the  same way. Basically I don't feel any type of emotion for my  family/friends. I have moments with them where I laugh, I have a good  time but I feel like they are not an important part of my life. When  both my grandmas died I wasn't sad or anything, for the most part I was  feeling uneasy because everyone else would seem sad and I wasn't.  
If I  had to stop seeing/talking to my family/friends I would not care, I  probably would not feel anything if they died. The only thing I'm glad  of is that I do feel bad about thinking this which is probably the only  thing that separates me from a sociopath I guess.
