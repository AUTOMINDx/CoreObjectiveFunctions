I feel like a slut
I’m a college student I sucked this guy off and now everyone knows about it and thinks lowly of me. He’s a friend of a friend. I like his best friend and he had a really positive image of me but now he thinks so differently of me and this is only the first term. I’ve messed everything up now I’m known as just another one of those “girls” who doesn’t know what the fuck they’re doing and that’s what everyone sees me as and I’m not like that but that image of me will never go away I have no self esteem left. And not even that but I messed up with my best friend aswell and everyone just sees me so differently my reputation is at its lowest I just want to cry because it makes me think so lowly of myself I just feel anxious about going back
