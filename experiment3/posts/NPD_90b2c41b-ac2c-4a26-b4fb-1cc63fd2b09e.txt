Psychologist told me it’s unlikely i have npd because i can show mercy?
I told her my former psychologist (after she got kids she stopped working so i can’t see her) told me i have strong narcissistic tendencies and she asked me if i saw a hungry little kitten, would i feed it and i said yes i would and she told me because i can show mercy i don’t have npd?? I honestly don’t know what to do or say (my npi score is 33 btw ☠️)
