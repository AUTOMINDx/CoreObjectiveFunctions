Talked with my parents about seeing a therapist
So, I discovered I may have ADHD Inattentive (along with I suspect is a depression) and whether it's true or not it gave me the push I needed to talk to my parents about going to a therapist. It's way more simple to talk about ADHD than depression.

So yayy, I did a great step to the right direction and I'm proud of me

Merry Christmas !
