Do you guys feel like the DNC is incompetent compared to the RNC?
To put it bluntly, I feel like the DNC keeps fucking everything up (*cough cough 2016*), and backing Tom Perez and Beto O'Rourke as governor candidates is the final straw. Just by looking at party registration numbers and people's opinions on policy positions, we should be winning easily. Instead, the DNC keeps fucking a lot of shit up, from funding Amy McGrath in 2020 to constantly pissing off progressives (*cough cough 2016 Primaries and what they did to Ben Jealous*) to making the strategy Trump bad (he is) when Biden is unpopular to not responding to the GOP's attempts to court some voters through issues like education.

So, do you believe that the DNC is incompetent compared to the RNC? And if you believe so, what do you think we (or the DNC) could do to make the DNC competent.
