Feel Like I Accidentally Got an "A" in Therapy Today
At the end of session today, T said, "The time always goes by fast with you." It was followed by a kind smile. I'm pretty sure that means I am ROCKIN'  this therapy thing! ðŸ˜…  

Internally I'm doing the Rocky arms in the air. Externally-tiny smile, no eye contact.
