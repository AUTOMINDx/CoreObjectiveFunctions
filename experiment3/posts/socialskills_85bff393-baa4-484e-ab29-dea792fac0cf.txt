Friend decided she doesn’t want me as a friend anymore
I’m having a hard time understanding it all. We have been best friends (like do everything together friends) for two years. Randomly after I gave her a Christmas gift she decided to tell me she doesn’t trust me and she doesn’t accept my gifts. Nothing leading up to it, we just went out together last weekend and I purposely stayed sober so she wouldn’t have to Uber, because she’s super afraid of ubering alone. I just feel so alone and upset that she wouldn’t bring this up sooner. I currently have all the gifts I got for her back at my house after she opened them all. I just feel so awkward and don’t know how to move on, we work together and have for two years. I feel like things will never go back to how they were. 

Sorry for the confusion, I’m 23 F and she is 24 F
