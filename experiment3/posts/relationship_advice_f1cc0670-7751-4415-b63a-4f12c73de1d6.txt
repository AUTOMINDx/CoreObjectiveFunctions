How can I salvage things with my wife?
My (42M) wife (38) and I have been married for 17 years. I think our marriage is over.

Our daughter (14) doesn't want a relationship with her mother anymore. At all. I've made the decision not to force her. We're both staying in a hotel right now. I'm going to try to be brief here, but more details on the original situation are in this post:

Okay, my post got blocked for the link. But, if you go to my profile, it's my only other post.

The long and short is: my wife is racist and homophobic, and I had no idea. She's been bullying our daughter's PoC friend and being controlling to our daughter (refusing to let her wear pants to school and other things). Our daughter might me trans or bisexual or neither, and I have no idea how to handle it. I've been reading some things and watching some videos, but the information is confusing. One thing everyone seems to say though is that I have to protect my daughter from anyone that might hurt her. My wife might be one of those people.

We can't stay in a hotel forever, especially once the holiday break is over. Eventually, my daughter and I have to go back home to my wife. My wife is angry with me. She didn't see our daughter at all on Christmas, and she has texted that she might never forgive me for that. I don't know if I can ever forgive her either.

Is there a way for me to get her to accept that our daughter might not be straight? I have no idea how to have the conversation, especially since my daughter hasn't given me permission to tell her mom about that. How can I save our marriage?
