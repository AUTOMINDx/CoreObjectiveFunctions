Terrified my 3 and 1 year old will be sick after eating 4 year expired frozen fish
Male child, 3 years, 28 pounds
Female child, 18 months, 24 pounds

No medications and no duration - this just happened

My son and daughter were fed frozen Mahi-mahi fish that was expired by 4 years, that was defrosted 2 times. We moved and it was in a bag of food to throw away, but my mother in law thought it was new so she cooked food for the kids with it. Is there anything I can do but wait it out? Also, what kind of food poisoning can they get from this? I’m so worried that it’s just a matter of time before they are in a lot of pain and throwing up or worse.
