Boyfriend (33) ignores me since 1 week after not wanting to visit my family. I feel so sad, mad and confused.. all at once. I literally don't know what to do. Was my reaction too much?
Hi everyone, 

My boyfriend (M 33) is stonewalling and ignoring (F 31) me for a whole week. We have a relationship since a year. Family is very important to me, but he is shy so he didn't want to visit my family. I respected that. When we were 8 months together he met my parents for the first time really quick at a bday party. He didn't see any family since. Last weekend my parents invited us for their bday party. I asked him about it and he didn't want to go. 

Obviously I was annoyed because of that. Not mad, but annoyed. I told him that it was difficult to understand him without any explination. He didn't answer me, he always does that when we have a disagreement. I said he was exaggerating and that I kind of thought it was rude. 

But okay, I went alone to the bday party and he went home. Since then (a week ago) I didn't hear anything from him. I thought he needed some space, but 48h later I texted him. No response..I called, no response. He doesn't live nearby so I didn't had the time (because of work) to visit him. Now it's a week later since the bday party. Still no response, although I texted him (I even asked why he won't answer me). I'm so sad, mad and confused all at once. I feel like he doesn't give a shit about me. This feels so fucked up. The ignoring is killing me.

At least he could give me an explination or reaction. He did this (stonewalling) before during other arguments, but not for a whole week!! I don't know what to do. Was my reaction too much??? My parents are very normal and kind people. 

I really need some advice here. 

Summary: boyfriend (M 33 - together for 1 year) is stonewalling me since 1 week after not wanting to visit my parents.
