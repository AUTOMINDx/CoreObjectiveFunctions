I packed what I could and left tonight
Tonight I took my 11 month old daughter, packed as many necessities as I could fit in my car, and left for a hotel. I finally decided that I’m done putting up with my nMom’s bullshit. I am a single mom and ever since I had my daughter my own mother has been undermining every single parenting decision that I make. I’m too tired now to go into everything. I don’t think I’ll get much sleep in this hotel tonight, but for a moment when I was driving away, I felt such an immense sense of relief. Now I can finally get my daughter into daycare so I can work full time and get an apartment. My nMom has been holding me back from accomplishing anything the entire time. I can finally raise my daughter in a place that isn’t toxic. I don’t have to be stuck there any more. There are still a lot of uncertainties about what will happen in the future, but I have a plan now on what I’m going to do and how I’m going to get my own place. 

Wish me luck out here in the world!
