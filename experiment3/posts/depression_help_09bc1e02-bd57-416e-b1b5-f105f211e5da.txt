Finding no joy in life
Hey Reddit,

For a long time now, I've been battling with depression and anxiety. Recently I've been struggling to find joy in anything I do.

Once listening to various types of music, watching the latest movies (or even old classics), playing video games brought me the joy of happiness in my life. Like my life was complete in that moment. Now, all of those things feel like empty calories and bring me little to no joy.

Once going to my jobs (one job as a welder, one job as a cook) felt like I was achieving something great, making something great for someone else that I can take great pride in. Now I just feel like it's all meaningless now matter how much effort or quality I put into in weld or patty melt.

The thought that keeps going through my head is that, "I have nothing in my life that defines me or brings me joy." I've been racking my brain on what brings me joy, day after day, and nothing pops in my head.

Is this the mid life crisis of a 28 year old guy, or just the coming realization that nothing matters no matter what I do or how much effort I put in.
