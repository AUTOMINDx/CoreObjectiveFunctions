Thinking of giving up on my dissertation after 7 years
I'm just burned out, tired, and feel like a failure. My mom (suicide), step-father and my cat died during my PhD but I kept pushing forward anyway. Severe burnout, health issues (currently on medication), changing advisors, and a pandemic later and I am losing my TT job at the end of spring 2022.

I don't know what I should do and don't really have people to talk to. I feel worthless and don't know what else I could do. Who would want to hire me? I know I shouldn't think this way but I am just completely at a breaking point.

Has anyone been through this? What did you do? I could use some inspiration and guidance.
