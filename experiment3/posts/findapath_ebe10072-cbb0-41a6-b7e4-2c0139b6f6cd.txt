I have no idea what path I want to take and I'm honestly terrified. 25M.
note: this is a bit of a long post, and I just *need* to get this stuff out. 

**TL;DR**: 25 yr old man working in warehouse for 7 years, lonely, single, looking for some job or path that would put me around people. But I'm not a great speaker, so maybe not *too much* socializing? I wouldn't want talking to *be* my job, you know? No sales work, probably. It'd be nice to be part of a pleasant group, I guess. 

I like writing but don't want to monetize that anymore. I like animals, but what jobs pay decently to work with animals?

I think I'd describe my overall feeling as the feeling of being left behind. I feel like I missed my chance, like at this time I should have a girlfriend, be finishing college or in a solid career. I feel like I have no close friends left. I feel like I have to start over, and at 25, behind. I don't think these are very rational thoughts, but I can't seem to disconnect from my negative emotions. And I'm tired, I really am. And I feel paralyzed by some inexplicable fear to change things. 

I'm a 25-year-old man, living with a roommate, working a warehouse job for 7 years now, have developed minor back pain, have destroyed my ability to concentrate (I might need to get tested for ADHD, I dunno), don't regularly hang out with anyone because I don't have any close friends... It's incredibly depressing, and I think all of it is slowly dragging me into depression. I'm trying so hard to fight against it, but I don't know if I'm even succeeding. 

I've tried to get into the freelancing business with copyediting, since I like to write sometimes (but again, my inability to focus has ruined this), but it's so hard to find jobs. I've sent out dozens of proposals in the last month alone and haven't gotten *anything*. One client that hands me $50-200 a month for some editing work is all I got there. 

I was working 4 10s at my warehouse, but I switched to part-time because my back and being at a warehouse 4 days of the week just killed me inside. 

I just recently moved out of my parents, a few months back. I feel like I might've been babied too much or something, because I don't know how to do shit. I don't know much about cars, I know how to cook only a few simple recipes, I feel lazy when it comes to cleaning and exercise... I began exercising this year weekly, and sometimes I do it 4+ times a week, sometimes only once; but I tell myself it's something, that a small build-up is required. 

I try to meditate, but I can only go a minute at most before my brain pushes me elsewhere. 

The worst thing about all this is that I have so much fucking free time. And I don't know what to do with it all. I would've enjoyed this 5 years ago, but not now. 

*Now* I have one co-worker who I've been friends with for 10 years, but never hangs out outside of work. I have a few internet friends I chat with sometimes. I've got one old friend that I'm trying to reconnect with, but it's rough. I've got two brothers and two parents who do love me, *especially* my mom, who I love to death; honestly, I really miss her. I almost *want* to move back into my parents' house, even though it's not particularly big. This makes me feel like I've been babied too much and am just trying to hide from the brutality of the world. My roommate is also my cousin, and I do have that extended family of some cousins, but we're not particularly close. I feel like that's partially my fault, since I turned down so many invitations to family events over the years in a want to just be alone and play video games or write or do whatever. 

I considered myself an introvert a few years back, but lately I feel like something else, maybe an extrovert with some kind of anxiety disorder that's stopping me from just *doing* shit. I like socializing. But I sometimes stutter a little, 

All of this has lead to me becoming a pothead. I smoke daily, several times a day, just to get away from the crushing anxiety, boredom, minor depression... I don't know. I don't have suicidal thoughts. I don't think the weed has worsened my life, but I don't know if I can say it's improved it. At most, it's a conversational topic. 

I don't plan video games much anymore, as I just can't find the interest. I'm excited for a few games like Elden Ring, but the love I had for games once is burnt out. 

**I wish I had a couple of online friends to play some games with.** But what multiplayer games are there that I'm into? Rocket League might be the only one (I'm in Diamond currently, if anyone wants to play HMU). At this point I'd try out a game just to try and connect with someone else, that's how lonely I feel. I can't imagine what people with truly no one must experience. 

In my teen years I dated a few girls, had a couple close friends, and I remember being generally happy then. Then I graduated, stopped talking to 99% of the people I used to talk to in HS, went to community college where I dragged my feet for 3 years, never finished (I have like 3 classes left for the Associate's Degree), drifted away from my last close friend, who I'm trying to reconnect with now... He's got it even harder in life than me, too. 

I applied to this Merit America thing, which is supposed to take you through some online bootcamp for a few months and then help you get a job with the connections they have. I applied for an IT certificate, 3 months long, lot of work but... What else can I do? I don't care for IT work, really, but I don't think I'd be bad at it. Maybe I could use it as a stepping stone to get into programming, but I don't know if I'll like that either. 

I don't talk to any women, really. I'm not sure I want a girlfriend. I think I do, just to share my life with someone. I'm tired of being alone.

I like animals, but what jobs pay decently to work with animals? They're usually pretty low-paying, right?
