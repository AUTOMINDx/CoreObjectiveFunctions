For those doing video teletherapy, do you get "dressed" for therapy?
I find myself always embarrassed by the fact that I'm in sweatpants or Pjs during our sessions while my T is always dressed professionally. I'm wondering how common this is and if it's something I should try to improve

I have my therapy appointments in the evening so usually, by then it's time for me to wind down my day and get comfy.
