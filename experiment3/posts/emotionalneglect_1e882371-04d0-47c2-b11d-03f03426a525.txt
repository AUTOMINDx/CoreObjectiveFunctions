Remember to be kind to yourself this holiday season
The most *'wonderful'* time of the year is here again and for a lot of us this is a very intense or rough period. So remember to be kind to yourself. 

Have that cup of hot chocolate milk or that present for yourself, you deserve it. Tune out of socials for a while, there's no need to keep scrolling through other people's Christmas posts. Loosen the expectations and the pressure you put on yourself: you're making progress, give it time. Don't let others determine how you should act or feel, stay true and respect your boundaries. Feeling stuck: go take a walk - the fresh air will do some good. Or do whatever floats your boat - it is your boat after all! 

Wishing you all the best!
