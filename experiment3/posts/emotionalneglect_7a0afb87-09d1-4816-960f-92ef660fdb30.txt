DAE just forgive people too quickly?
My therapist pointed out that I never let my negative emotions out. Ever. I dissociate from them as quickly as I can. In fact, I will do everything possible to think of them as 'good' and me and my needs as 'bad.' 
 
I try to "correct" them. Basically gaslight myself into thinking it wasn't bad and upsetting people, and then take "accountability" because I can never really express how I'm actually feeling. Because I've never been allowed to express any kind of disappointment. It brings so much shame inside even though logically I know it's not my fault. 

I think this is one of the reasons why we severely underestimate CEN. Because you're so used to being with people at the cost of yourself, you don't really see what you lost and what you actually deserve.
