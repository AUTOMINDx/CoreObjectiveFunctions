The Entry-Level job market is a scam
When there are not enough entry level jobs in a certain industry, the number of underemployed or unemployed graduates increases. This [image](https://imgur.com/a/diFsXvK) shows a micro-example of the number of engineering degree holders doubling in a city while the number of those employed rises only slightly in comparison. 

When we see the number of underemployed college graduates rising across the western world, we can draw the same conclusion. Once the number of graduates greatly outpaces the growth of entry level jobs available, we get stats saying **"almost half of college graduates are underemployed".**

I've heard solutions across the political landscape and they seem to ignore the fact that none of these options work if every entry-level hopeful follows them. **Free college can't fix the lack of entry level good jobs.** Trade schools can't solve it either when the goal is to increase access to middle class wages. What happens when you increase supply of entry level workers? 

A redditor, u/LTEDan, made a comment that hasn't been able to get out of my head: 

&gt;"Yup, the solution is millions of people suddenly flood the trades...NOT!  Ignoring the fact that it would be difficult to find an apprenticeship, you'd have the same problem but with skilled trades:  too many people with a skillset and not enough jobs. 

&gt;The problem with many degrees is not that the degree itself is inherently worthless but that too many people pursued the same degree relative to the number of jobs available in that field aka your classic supply vs. demand problem. 

&gt;If you got lucky and picked a trade you're probably sitting pretty and feeling smug and  like you're smarter than all these college educated people, but you're not.  If you were you'd have recognized the supply vs demand issue that was years away probably when you were 18 and picking the trades which means you'd not recommend everyone divert to the trades because it would literally cause the same supply vs demand issue for the trades, and kill your golden goose. 

&gt;What's the solution then?  Well besides overthrowing capitalism or similar it's to ensure that each year there's a good mix of the graduating class that pursues trades and degrees.  Knowing how many available jobs in a particular field there are, and projections of job growth (or decline) as well as the projection of how many students in the hopper are pursuing degrees for each field and trade would help some make a better decision about which field to pick. 

&gt;There's also the German model where you're given a test around the age of 11 which then determines your future if you're eligible for college or the trades.  It's not perfect but at least the German system tries to even load blue collar vs white collar jobs by setting kids on a path appropriate to their skillset."

What do you think?

**Edit:** I've had some debaters come to my DMs and I thank those that argued in good faith. I truly made this post to have my ideas challenged.

 At this point I'm starting to realize there aren't enough good jobs due to globalization, automation, inflation decreasing buying power, etc. The people that blame the individual seem to argue two things:

1. Learn a trade, dont pick a useless major, etc.

If I argue that there aren't enough entry level jobs for all the highschool grads and underemployed people to pivot to en masse (meaning you can do everything right and still fail):

2. Not everyone is supposed to succeed. Competition is good.

These 2 arguments seem counterintuitive since the advice just leads to "oh well".  

Sidenote: 
&gt;I love the trades as a solution for the individual. I just wish there were a solution that still worked if droves of people flocked to it that wouldn't create bottlenecks at the entry level.

&gt;It used to be "do a STEM" or "learn to code" and now it's "learn a trade". When we oversaturate the entry level market we just increase barriers to entry. Now many STEM majors need grad school for jobs that only needed associate's degrees a few decades ago. I don't think a flood of applicants for trade/sales jobs will lead to anything different. 

&gt;**Stigma against trade/sales jobs is *why* you can enter the field without a 4yr degree**. Lack of competition is *why* mid-level trade jobs have great salaries. Many parents and young adults are waking up to the idea that higher ed isn't a sure thing. Where do you think they'll look next? **What happens when we oversaturate an industry with applicants?** Wages go down. Job requirements go up.

&gt; If you would like more info on this phenomena of job reqs increasing in fields that didn't require a degree before (*including the blue collar industries*): "Dismissed by Degrees" by the Harvard Business Review is a solid report.

The counterargument is to get what you can while you can get it. **I agree that the individual should do that**. But when I ask them what to do with the leftover people that did what they were supposed to do, "not everyone is supposed to succeed". 

This appears to be where the industry treadmill ends. Once all the entry level job markets are oversaturated you just get in line and hope you picked a short line. "Sucks for you"

I think this is what I came for and why I made the post. I needed to see where this counter argument ended. Now that I do I feel satisfied. I don't want my society to function like this.
