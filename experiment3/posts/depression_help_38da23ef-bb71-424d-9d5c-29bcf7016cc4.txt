lonely.
I feel so low. I look in the mirror and I see what I don’t want to be, I hate what I see. I’m so disappointed in myself for how pointless my life has become. All I feel is sad, honestly I can’t remember the last time I felt happy. My family don’t want to have an embarrassment like me, my partner doesn’t understand anything and everyone acts like I should be happy. I don’t feel it I want to but i can’t. I feel so alone in this world I don’t have anyone to talk to, I try to talk to my partner but he doesn’t get it. I can’t see my well-being coach or counsellor anymore because of a new job I started. I was ready to put everything of my ex in the past and heal but now I can’t see them. All I want at this point is for something to take me away, I don’t care anymore if I smell or if I don’t eat I just want to be free. I’ve never tried to heal from my past I buried it all now it’s all come back, I can’t escape any of it inside my head. My mind goes crazy whenever I overthink I hear his voice screaming at me telling me how pathetic I am, I hear her voice saying I’m not good enough. I know they’re both right. My mind races with all these thoughts of how grotesque I am I don’t want this life. I want to be a bird so I can be free.
