Wondering if I should come out to my family
So I’m (19 AFAB) like 99.9% sure I’m non-binary (not 100% because self doubt won’t let me) and I’ve been discovering my gender identity for over a year now and thinking for the past 4-5 months if I should come out to my family (parents and younger brother). I know they are LGBTQ+ friendly, if a bit uneducated on the finer points of the TQ+ part (I’ve been working on educating them and honestly that’s probably blown my cover). I’ve subtly (or at least I hope so) implied that I know longer want to be perceived as a girl; through referring to myself with neutral terms like “sibling” and “child”. I’m just scared to take the final step and come out and directly say it. I’m worried that they won’t fully understand and won’t be able to use my pronouns or if I want to eventually get a binder or change my name they will make a fuss. 

I thought about coming out on new years and then giving them an adjustment period of 1 year, but those plans have been ruined by the fact that we’ll be visiting extended family at that time. Now I don’t know when to do it and idk how to hype myself up. Any advice?
