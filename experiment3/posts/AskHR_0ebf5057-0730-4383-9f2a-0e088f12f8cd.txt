[NC] 30 Day Resignation
My job requires that we give 30 day notice. Yesterday I sent a formal resignation to HR. One month is Monday 1/17 and it’s a holiday so we’re off, but it’s exactly 30 days. I also sent an email to our office informing them that I’ll miss them, but I’m resigning and my last day will be 1/14. An hour after all of this I get an email from my manager saying that I cannot set my own last day without her approval and that she must know where or if I’ll be employed when I leave. I sent my resignation to HR directly because of her past erratic behavior.

Our HR policy clearly states that an employee must give 30 day notice. If the employee is not transferring within the company, the only say the manager has in their last day is if they waive the 30 day period, but they have to prove the employee has committed a workplace violation. 

I’m curious as to how much say she has in me staying longer than 30 days. I also don’t believe I’m obligated to tell her where or if I’ll be employed when I leave. I’m an at will employee and there is no non-compete clause as part of my employment. Do I have to tell her anything? Does this count as adequate 30 days even though 1/17 is a holiday?
