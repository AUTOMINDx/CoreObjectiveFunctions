Columbine was not the first school shooting, so why is it considered so significant?
My brain decided to dig up some memories from when I was in 5th grade for some reason. 

While I've never studied the case in depth I do know what most people know or maybe slightly more, just what happened and a general idea of why. (Why is always a complicated thing, I try not to dig too deep into that.)

But I'm still curious as to why this is considered such a big, life-changing event when it was not the first school shooting. Can you help me fill in this part of the puzzle?
