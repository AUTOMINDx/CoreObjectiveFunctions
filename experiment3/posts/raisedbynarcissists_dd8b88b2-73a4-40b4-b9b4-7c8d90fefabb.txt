An update to: “My Christmas present this year is getting custody of my cat”
Well, guys…. MERRY FREAKIN’ CHRISTMAS!!

At 11:26am this morning, I received the email that Buddy has been transferred into my name!!

This is the best Christmas present ever, and we’ve just had a huge hug. I’m so over the moon. I’ve been turmoiling over this for *months.*

Thank you everyone who counted down with me, I hope your holidays are as narc-free and as joyous as mine &lt;3

Please enjoy this photo of Buddy inspecting his Christmas present under the tree this year:
