If I give my job an ultimatum and threaten to quit unless I get a raise, and they fire me, can I collect unemployment?
Two of my coworkers and I are considering submitting a letter to management that lays out all the reasons we are unsatisfied with our current pay, and that all of us will be gone within a month if we don't get a raise to $X/hour. Could they fire us for this, and would we be eligible for unemployment benefits?
