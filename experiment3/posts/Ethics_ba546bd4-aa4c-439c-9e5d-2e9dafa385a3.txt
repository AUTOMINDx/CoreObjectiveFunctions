Paying author directly for e-book found on free site
I read a series which is translated into German, which I am trying to pick up. The first three books were formerly available as e-books, but have been discontinued (paperback editions are also not available). They are available, however, on b-ok, which shares e-books for download. I no longer use it, as these are not books that were intended to be free.

The author of this series has a Patreon account, which enables direct donations. If I were to download the books, and then make a donation equal to the former price of the books together, have I then met my obligation to her as the maker of the product? As far as I can tell, the translator himself does *not* receive royalties per copy, meaning that if I purchased a copy of the book from a bookshop (online or not), he would not have a claim to anything from the sales price.
