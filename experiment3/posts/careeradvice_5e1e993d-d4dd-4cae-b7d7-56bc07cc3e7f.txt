I don't understand why my company doesn't fire me?
I perform very poorly at my current job as a Software Developer. 

I get at least 1-3 complaints a day about how I don't follow instructions well or I'm not doing a good job at development. I feel like most of my teammates even avoid me because they think I don't do a good job on things.

Yet, I've been at the company for almost a year and I haven't been fired.  Why don't they just fire me? I feel like there's lots of people who want to be in a Software Developer position also. It seems like they should have plenty of candidates.

There's only two things I can think of:

1. In my previous role, I received multiple awards so maybe they think they're not doing a good job coaching me

2. Maybe companies have something against firing employees that I'm not aware of.
