Intrusive existential thoughts
Hello! 

I’m 18 and have struggled with DPDR for as long as I can remember. It was always a manageable feeling but as of the past 3 or 4 (???) months I’ve been stuck in this state of DPDR.

The main thing that upsets me is the existential thoughts. At this point it’s pretty much the only thing that triggers it. I cannot physically stop my mind from asking these impossible to answer questions, and I constantly question if my life has any meaning, or if there’s any purpose to existing. I wonder if I’m real and I wonder what that even is.

It’s a really shitty combination of things to experience. Anyone relate/have tips on dealing w this?

Also for reference, I would love to try therapy but I can’t afford it. :/
