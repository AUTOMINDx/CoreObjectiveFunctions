having to improve every situation?
anybody else suffering from the feeling having to improve every situation (except your own) and make everything better/everyone feel better because they're never enough and it's the only way to even be recognized? i feel like i'm never in the moment because of it, i can never accept things the way they are and life is passing me by... 

how do i deal with it?
