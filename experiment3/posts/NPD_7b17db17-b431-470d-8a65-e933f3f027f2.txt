Becoming self aware is destroying me
Since I’ve became self aware my world is turned upside down. I’m so depressed, I can’t enjoy the things I normally like doing, everything’s pointless, I feel broken, I don’t give a crap about Christmas, I can see all of my flaws &amp; how pathetic I am. I honestly don’t know if I can get through this.
