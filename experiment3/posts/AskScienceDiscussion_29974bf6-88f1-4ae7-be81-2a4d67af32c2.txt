Why do propellers not have "wing tips" like planes do?
From my understanding, planes have little wing tips to reduce wing tip vortices which create added drag. I know propellers don't quite work like wings but often have a similar cross sections to generate lift, albeit this cross section changes along the length of the prop to accommodate speed differences. 

So why then, don't we see wing tips at the end of propeller blades?
