I’m so scared my life is gonna stay like this
I’m extremely lonely, i have 0 irl friends, no one there for me when my anxiety strikes or when my depression overcomes me, august 28 2021 was the worst day in the year for me, it was my birthday, 0 friends, no one sang happy birthday for me, i decided to treat myself and go out to eat and had a mental breakdown in the restaurant, gosh I haven’t had friends in years.
