What does the eigenvalue gives us in quantum mechanics?
In class we learned that the probability of a particle to be in a given place is calculated using an integral of the wave function module in the interval that we are interested in.
Then we introduced operators, and we have seen that to find the average of something (example kinetic energy) we need to integrate from minus infinity to infinity
 Phi*(x) Â Phi(x) dx
where Â is the kinetic energy operator, and this should work for all kind of operators (momentum, position, Epot,...) 
Then we have seen that if phi(x) is an eigenfunction, 
ÂPhi(x) = aPhi(x)
where a is an eigenvalue. 

What exactly does that eigenvaule represent in the physical word?
