I’m quitting drinking, completely and for good.
I’m sure things like this get posted often here, but this is for motivation, and maybe to help someone else out of a hole. I used to think I was a high functioning person despite the issue, but I’ve come to realize I’m an absolute displeasure to be around when I’m inebriated. That and just reckless decision making. I get into this horrible headspace and wake up hating who I turned into the night before. I’ve gotten to the point where I really don’t want to life my life like that anymore. I’m only about a week in, but my mind, body, and spirit feel ten times better! For anyone else trying to do the same, remember you’re not alone and we all have our reasons for doing it!
