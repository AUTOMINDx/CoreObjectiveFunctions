How much control should parents have over their children?
This is actually something that has been on my mind a lot. As I see myself losing a traditionalist view on life (as I move away from the Jehovah's Witness religion) for a more secular one, I began to think that there are more and more things that parents should not be able to do to their kids. But there are still some things that seem to be in grey are for me, so I would like some opinions on these. 


Should parents be allowed to:

1. Send their kids to religious schools?

2. Circumcise their kids?

3. Use corporal punishment on their children?

4. Send their children to conversion camps?

5. Pull their children from certain classes in public schools?

6. Stop their children from getting vaccines?

7. Stop their children from getting things like hormone blockers?

For me personally, all of these are in a grey area, cause while I agree that parents shouldn't do some of these things, I think it's more of a personal decision. Not really one that the Government should enforce. What do you think?

As always thank you for any replies.
