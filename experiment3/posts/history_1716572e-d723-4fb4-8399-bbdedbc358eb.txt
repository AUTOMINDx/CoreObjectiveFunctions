Could William the Conqueror conquered France instead of England
Normand of Italy quickly conquered the Lombards, and drove Byzantines out. Early Capetian was rule was very decentralized and the kings lacked much power that they would eventually obtain, so I don't think it is unfair to compare the situation of Southern Italy to France itself.

During William's day, Normandy itself was one of the wealthiest parts of France, so it isn't like lacked resources. It might be that England was a more alluring target because it lacked castles (only burgs intend to hold off small raiding parties, not outlast sieges), meanwhile France had spent the whole 10th century building the country full of castles.
