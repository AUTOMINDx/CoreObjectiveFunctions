My therapist disappeared
I'd been working with this therapist through Pride Counseling (online counseling thing) for over a year. He's the only therapist that has ever really gotten through to me and helped me. I've been going through absolute hell the past few months and am barely hanging on. He helped. I needed him. I trusted him. He was so reassuring and I thought he'd be there. There was no indication he was going to discontinue. I was working through some hard stuff and also grieving the end of a relationship. 

He missed my session this week with no message, and hasn't replied to any messages. I finally my messaged Pride Counseling itself and they told me he was "unavailable" and they didn't know when he'd be back. They said I could pick a new one, as though you can just swap out a therapist like changing socks. 

I can't imagine starting over, especially with how badly I'm struggling right now. I'm worried about him, and wondering if something happened. At the same time, I'm freaking the hell out that I must be such a horrible, unbearable person that even my therapist ghosted me.

Edit: it was a technical issue and everything is fine, other than my dignity
