Just tried telling my mother about something good I ate
I told her the restaurant and how I got a really good vegetarian lasagne from there, and she immediately went “oh I got something from there once and it was awful”. Started saying how she didn’t like vegetarian stuff cause they always put stuff like garlic in it and I was like ??? You use garlic in food all the time?? Then she asked me how much it cost and I told her ($10 for a good sized portion, it’s a small business that makes their food fresh on site and they’ve gotta make a living) and she immediately started saying ‘wow that’s expensive, sounds like a ripoff, they probably were ripping you off’ like just because they don’t cost the same as cheap fast food businesses that are wildly successful with a shitton of profits doesn’t mean you’re getting ripped off?

Anyway I digress. Whenever I try to tell her about something good to exciting in my life she always finds a way to brush it off and make it a negative thing and it’s really fucking annoying. Not once did she say anything like ‘that’s cool’ or ‘we should go there sometime’ or even ‘glad you liked it’ she just made it about herself and made it negative, which, might I add, is something she often gets mad at a family friend for, ‘always making things about herself’. Real fucking hypocrite.

I’m sick of it, honestly.
