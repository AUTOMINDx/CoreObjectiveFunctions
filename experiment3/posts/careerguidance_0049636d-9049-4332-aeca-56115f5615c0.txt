I'm looking for an easy job that'll pay the bills while I'm trying to figure myself out. Any ideas?
Here's the deal. I'm 21/M, I've given the question a lot of thoughts but I still have no idea what I want to do with my life. I figured I could get educated to find a job while I figure out what I want to do. Ideally it'd pay the bills, wouldnt be taxing on the mind and body, schedule would be flexible and there'd be plenty of jobs available. Maybe something in IT? Anyway I'm probably not gonna find something exactly like that but if you guys know of something similar and how I could get there, please do tell. Thanks
