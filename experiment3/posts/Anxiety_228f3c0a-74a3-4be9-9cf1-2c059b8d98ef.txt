Hey! I just wanted to remind you that even if other people are struggling more, it doesn't mean that your problems aren't valid.
I've always felt like I'm faking my mental illness because lots of my other friends have severe anxiety or depression. I have moderate anxiety so I sometimes feel kinda invalid/ashamed ig? But if you have mental health issues that aren't severe, they are still mental health issues!
