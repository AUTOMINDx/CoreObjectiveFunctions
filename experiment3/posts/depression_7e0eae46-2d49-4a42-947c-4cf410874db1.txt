I hate how depression robs you of any self-worth.
The second someone says anything slightly negative towards me- especially if it's a stranger- I immediately get upset. I got into a dumb argument on here about how to do a very simple thing that I used to do at my job. If I had been doing it wrong, I wouldn't have been working there for so long. Yet the downvotes and rude comments still upset me. Everyone assumes I'm a colossal idiot. I'm actually crying over it and trying to keep quiet because I can't explain why I'm upset without sounding dumb.

Edit: All of the comments here really turned my day around. You are all more than worthy of love and respect. If only we could tell ourselves that, you know?
