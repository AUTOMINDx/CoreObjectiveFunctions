Career start ? what to choose ?!
Hello everyone , i am a fresh graduate mechanical power engineer. 

I have two job opportunities at the moment, the first one is in a well known consulting office as a plumbing and firefighting junior designer. 

The second one is maintenance site engineer  in  Heidelberg cement . i can't really decide what to choose and i am afraid of the consequences.
