When did you realize that you grew up in a toxic household and what made you start working on your healing?
I grew up thinking that a father who’s always out drinking and a mother who’s always yelling at you is normal. I had to speed up the process of maturing emotionally because I had no one to run to, I had to figure things out on my own. 

I didn’t realize that I have childhood trauma not until I was roommates with a guy who’s an alcoholic and I started getting triggered. The same feeling that I’ve experienced in childhood. I suppressed all of these memories in my childhood. 

Now I’m 34 years old and I’m focusing on working on myself because I know I’ll never have a fruitful relationships if I don’t work on myself.
