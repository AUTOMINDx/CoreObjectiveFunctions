Why Didn’t Vikings Bring Disease To The Indigenous People Of Greenland?
Why didn’t the Norse people bring the same kind of devastating diseases to the native people of Greenland that would characterize later European-Indigenous contact in the Americas? 

The Norse never had large-scale cities or towns on the island, to my knowledge, but I would think that after having a presence there for nearly five centuries they would have exposed the native population to the various diseases that would later wreak so much havoc further south.

Any ideas?
