Who's your favorite engineer in history?
Mine would be Sir Willis Carrier. The guy pioneered modern cooling which has made so many things possible and his work on power generation with turbines has had a major impact on the world as well.

This guy is a big reason for a lot of the things we have today.

I love Leonardo Da Vinci too who was probably the best engineer in the world but his work didn't really build on existing industrial infrastructure to advance the world.
