Aren’t high insurance premiums a substantial cause for middle class wage stagnation?
I saw a breakdown of my healthcare costs for the first time a few weeks ago. For my family of 6 (me, spouse, four kids) my employer pays $2400/mo for health insurance. Thankfully, they don’t require me to contribute. I am paid $52k/yr as a department lead. If insurance premiums were half of their current amount, I’d have a substantial pay raise. If insurance premiums were something reasonable, say like… $500/mo, my pay raise would be outstanding. I hear a lot of talk about how CEOs make too much and are widening the wage gap, but it seems to me that high insurance premiums are also choking out middle class wages.
