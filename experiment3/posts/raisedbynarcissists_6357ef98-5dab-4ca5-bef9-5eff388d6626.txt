This is a weird one... Just why?
My mom likes to walk into my room and complain, "It stinks in here". 

It's nearly impossible for that to be true, but what's the reason behind this choice of attack?

I have a twin (real) HEPA filter running in my bedroom 24/7 on high. You can't really smell anything bc of it.

I sometimes sweat a little in my sleep, bc I'm human and most of us do. Sometimes, but not always, a little bit more bc of meds and bad dreams. Again, not copious amounts of sweat and not that different than most others. I actually had meds changed to one that makes me sweat less bc I have hydration issues. 

My fan is almost always running when I'm sleeping. 

I change my bedding *at least* once a week or more. If it gets sweaty, then more often. 

Clean clothes all the time, always have on deodorant, etc. I don't keep rotting or smelly food in here either. Only like a Ziploc bag of cereal, candy, etc. Nothing to rot or stink.

My dirty laundry is from one day's wear (except pajamas) and then goes in the wash- it's kept in my bathroom until the hamper is full.

I shower or bathe every. single. day. (If I'm not sleeping for days, which I sometimes do bc of a sleep disorder.) Sometimes I bathe multiple times a day. 

In other words, I hate being smelly and I no matter how sick or tired or depressed or anxious, I do something about it. 

Yet, my mom still finds the need to pop her head in and make that comment that absolutely no one else in my family ever echoes. 

Just why? It's such an odd passive aggressive move. 

On the other hand, she doesn't bathe every day- only a few times a week, and doesn't change her bedding for weeks at a time and often both she and her room stink.
