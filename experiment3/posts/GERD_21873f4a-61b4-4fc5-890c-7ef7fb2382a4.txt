PPI is making GERD worse
So my doctor put me on a PPI (omeprazole) because my upper endoscopy showed mild gastritis. I don't have h pylori or anything else my GI doc tested or searched for. The central gastro issues I deal with though are severe bloating and flatulence, so my GI doc thought that maybe the PPI could let me know if stomach acid is the issue causing my bloating. However, while I typically put my head on a wedge pillow to keep the acid reflux down while I sleep, I otherwise don't really experience acid reflux symptoms at all.

Just one day after starting the PPI, the acid reflux is high up in my throat 24/7 and I feel the tension there now. Does this even make sense? I woke up with a bit of a sore acid throat, coughing, and I feel anxious. Am I giving myself way worse GERD by trying this when GERD wasn't even my central complaint to start with?? I'm worried that I'm going to create worse problems for myself by continuing... or is this just the normal getting-used-to-it period of trying PPIs where it gets worse before it gets better?
