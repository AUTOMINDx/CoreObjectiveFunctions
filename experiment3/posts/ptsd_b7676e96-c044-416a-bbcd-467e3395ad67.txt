aknowledging my childhood trauma has ruined my ability to form relationships and I feel broken
I have childhood sexual trauma from when I was four years old. I repressed my feelings about it for 25 years, not telling anyone or even acknowledge to myself that what happened was traumatic for me. I was just way too young to understand or to handle it, and I was to ashamed (and still am). Looking back as an adult I see how much it's shaped me, in particular my sexuality and my relationship to men. 

I can't trust that any man can like me as a person at all. In my head, they just wan't me sexually or they wouldn't even talk to me. Not that I think I'm irresistibly desireable at all, I just can't see any other reasen, not even when I know they have specifik reasons (like colleagues). If they're nice to me, it must be because they want to use me. I know this isn't true and is completely irrational, but the worst part is that this has shapen how I behave around men in every situation, and I don't know how to break away from that. I'm able to handle it in professional relationships, but now when I'm acknowledging the trauma dating and forming a close relationship seems impossible. 

I just can't trust them. The initial, more sexualized part is easy, but as soon as the first date is over and we've slept together I just don't know what to do anymore. I get so much anxiety, I'm so scared that they're gonna leave me and I don't think they actually like me. I just don't know how to trust them or let them in. I've had several long relationships before and been very happy, but ever since I started talking about my trauma I just don't know how to behave anymore, it's like I broke my brain by finally acknowledging it and I don't know how to fix myself. I can't even remember how I acted or felt in my past relationships, so I can't compare my past experiences to my current.  

I have no idea what to do. I feel like a broken human.
