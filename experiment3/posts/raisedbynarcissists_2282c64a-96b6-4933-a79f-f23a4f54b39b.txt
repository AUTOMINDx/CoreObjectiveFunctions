[Trigger Warning] This account is getting stalked by an abusive mother
Hey y'all,  


This post will be written by a 26 years old daughter, who's done with *this* shit.  
And read by both you and a mentally abusing, toxic train wreck of a mother in her mid 50s.  


And I'm hereby writing the very last post with my current reddit account and inviting all of you folks to give a little feedback to the "anonymous reader". I'm not asking you to be violent or insulting.  
I'm asking you to state in the comments how you would feel if your mother would stalk you online.  


Why? - Oh, because after cutting all the cords to her, she compensates the long promised neglection of her fed up daughter by stalking her online, sniffing through all the popular sites on the web for a scent of her offspring and then sending said offspring the feed via facebook messages, e-mail or text messages on her phone. - Which is totally not the reason why I've developed the strong urge of keeping my phone shut off and rarely visiting facebook or reading my e-mails over the past 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

(Well, facebook is a somewhat of a toxic environment anyways so that's not much of a loss.  
Good thing I don't use twitter.)

&amp;#x200B;

How strong that urge is? In september I've had my phone back in my hand after hiding it in a drawer for 2 years. And it is now BACK in the exact same drawer. I can't handle having it on and the woman who calls herself "my mother" is the reason behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

Or the reason why I get irrationally nervous during holidays and my birthday and can't sleep without packing a bag with all the necessities first. 100% not because I got kicked out of the house during my entire childhood on a regular basis during these times.  


Or the reason why I can't feel any joy when reaching a goal in my life or enjoy physical contact with other people without thinking that they are only close to me out of pity.  


Or the reason why I can't spend at least a week without having the worst hecking nightmares.  
The reason why I'm constantly looking tired with big blue shades underneath my eyes.  


Or the reason why I have sudden attacks of uncontrollable sobbing after midnight, connected to heavy flashbacks from the past years, while hiding in the bathroom so I don't wake up my boyfriend with my misery.  


Or the reason why I can't stand the scent of beer without feeling anxious and disgusted.  


Or the reason why the stress kickes off my hormone household over and over again, resulting in my body mirroring my mind.  


Or the reason why I'm questioning my own behaviour out of fear that I might unconsciously copy my mothers way of treating people and ruin my own relationships with it.   
Or maybe one day, my own kids.  


Or the reason why I immediately jump off a chair whenever I hear the sound of a keychain in the hallway or the 'cluck cluck' of high heels on floor tiles.  


Or the reason why I still hear her saying "You look like you're 5 months pregnant/ You look chubby/ You've got broad shoulders like a boy" to my teenage self, whenever I'm standing in front of a mirror today. With my stable 65kg which should make me feel 'normal-sized' and 'female' but simply don't because of my very own mother.  


Or the reason why thinking of visiting this woman in our old flat in my hometown gives me anxiety attacks so bad, that I end up crying and vomiting over the toilet. Yes, mom. Because I'm overdramatizing everything, I know. - I'm such a weak and overemotional woman.  
What a shame. Don't forget to call your cousin and tell her all about it.  


Or the reason why I'm AGAIN thinking about blocking her completely on social media and not giving a single flying FUCK about my fear of missing a call for help from her. And that fear is STRONG.  


Strong, since I've carried her drunken body out of a filled bathtub in the middle of the night and dragged her to her bed. Only to then proceed to clean up the traces of feces and vomit in the hallway in front of my room, leading all the way to the bathroom. As a 13 year old girl btw. What a joy!  


I've reached my limit. - I can't stand her shit anymore. 26 years and all I get out of her are empty promises, made up stories and yet ANOTHER scheme, trying to take control over my life.  


Mom, you don't care about what your actions cause. You don't care about the fact that my nervous ticks, my emotional instability and my insomnia are all caused by you. You didn't care about using me as a pity-tool in front of your friends, neighbours and police officers. Telling them that I'm mentally unstable and ruining your life. Telling them that YOU are afraid of ME while still having beer breath. - Or the fact that you told me to kill myself multiple times and then locked yourself up in the bathroom after you saw me taking the pills.  
You finally pushed me to do it and the first thing that came to your mind when you saw me taking these pills was:   


*Let's lock up in the bathroom and call the police. Telling them that my dying daughter in the kitchen is threatening me*.

&amp;#x200B;

You didn't even have the decency to answer the calls from the hospital, or to visit me.  
Or to ask me **how I've been** after I took an Uber back home after my treatment and positive psychological observation. You self-absorbed **bitch**. You just sat there at the kitchen table, with your so called 'friend' and watched me dragging my tired body back into my room. 

Like nothing ever happened.  


And when I called you this september and tried to get you into meeting in person and trying to 'restart', you left me hanging. Without even considering what I had to mentally pull off to find the courage for this.  


Steam, Discord, Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, Artstation, Deviantart and now even Reddit.  
This woman looks for me everywhere, copies whatever she finds of me online and then sends it to me.  
Usually accompanied by a witty text message like "Your english is getting better :Wink:".  


Changing account names doesn't help. She finds me again and again and I can't find an ounce of privacy nor peace. My boyfriend is fuming and I'm again in tears.  
I'm not allowed to be my own person.  


Now, mom. Since this subreddit is dedicated to people with "real problems" and "actually abusive mothers", why don't you let them tell you how absolutely fucking wrong and sickening it is, to stalk your adult daughter on the internet for the pure pleasure of provocation.  
I surely can't know what I'm talking about. But these people here might be able to tell wether or not 'this' is normal or not.  


Here's my final message to you: You've lost me. I'll make sure that there's no way for you to contact me ever again and this post will be the very last thing you'll read from me. This account will be pulled out of traffick. All my accounts will.  


To the people of this subreddit: Yes, I'm emotional right now. But I'm 100% serious with my request.  
I'm typing this because I know that she'll be reading my post from her computer **again.**   
And If she could have at least a glance of what other people with "actually abusive mothers" think about her habit, then maybe she'll at least consider to stop.  


My experience tells me that this probably won't happen but I'm a dumb fool and I'm afraid, nauseous and furious.
