[WI] how can I spin being terminated?
[WI] I was terminated for “attendance”. The state determined I was fired without cause as any time I was out (for necessary dr appointments) it was with advance notice and used pto. The company could not provide any sort of documentation, either in the employee manual or specific to me that I did anything wrong or was warned about attendance. 

What should I be saying in interviews about why I am no longer with that company?  

Thanks in advance
