Why do scientists say travel restrictions are ineffective in curbing the spread of COVID-19?
I mean, I take their word for it, I just don't understand it. I get the "it's already in your country by the time you shut the door" idea, but surely even at that point, instituting a travel restriction prevents a more rapid spread (due to, say, thousands of potentially infected people coming in and roaming around your country)? And by preventing a more rapid spread, that would buy time for whatever you need time for (vaccine modification, targeted lockdowns, etc)?

To me it seems like trees. Let's say you want a 100-tree forest. Surely you'd get 100 trees a lot faster by planting 100 seeds than by planting 2 seeds and waiting for them to create two trees, then have those two trees spread seeds that grow into more trees, etc?
