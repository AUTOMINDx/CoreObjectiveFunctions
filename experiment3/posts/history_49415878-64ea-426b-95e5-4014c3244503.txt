Alright, I need help picking another point in ancient/medieval Chinese history BESIDES the famed Three Kingdoms Period to research and look into. Anything before or after it, but NOT colonial or early modern history.
We all know about colonial China when the British Empire was kicking around the area, we know that China had some contact with Japan during the samurai hayday in the late and post sengoku jidai period, we know about the famed rise of communism over there too. However, China is a wonderful country beyond the oppressive regimes its sadly slagged with nowadays (not that there werent other moments of tyranny in the past mind you, just nothing like THIS...), it has a beautiful culture, and a fascinating history to boot.

Therefore, I ask that, besides the Three Kingdoms period of China that gets beat to heck and back in terms of how often it gets representation in popular media, what other periods from Chinese history can you suggest I look into? What other dynasties, points in time, would prove interesting for my own historic curiosity? Are there any periods which detail a history just as storied and fascinating as the Three Kingdoms period? Surely there must be, right?
