How much do you enjoy your Reddit anonymity?
I really value it myself, it's nice to be able to make an off colour joke without Facebook relatives being offended. I've been very careful to keep myself anonymous and have in the past even gone so far as to mask my ethnicity. I like the ability to be myself among my peers in topics that I can't express with RL acquaintances. Like how nerdy I am, or how much of a stereotypical car guy I am...

Something lately made me break out of this though, and I even went so far as to meet up with another u/ for an exchange.
