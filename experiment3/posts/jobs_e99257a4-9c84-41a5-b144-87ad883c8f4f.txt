Boss actually tried demanding me to donate to the companies “charity”
Lol I just have to tell someone this, so yesterday my boss comes up to me says, 
“hey, go donate $50 bucks to the fundraiser”
I kinda chuckled and said what, and then I realized he was serious, I continued to chuckle I said “yea, okay give me $100 bucks and I’ll donate $50” lmao.

I later found out the reason he is so caring this year and wants people to donate is all because his boss told him if he can get $1500 dollars (probably so the company can get some tax break) of donations so he can have a week off! Yippyyy for him. Needless to say I won’t be donating, sorry :/

I have no issue donating when it is a genuine act of kindness but for businesses or people that do it for the pure sake of self reward is sickening. 

That’s all hope you have a great day :) who ever is reading this
