Brother accused of sex abuse
My 15 y.o. niece came out and told the family that my brother had abused her. An investigation was conducted by the authorities and determined it to be a false accusation. She now lives with her mom and isn’t in contact with my brother anymore.

The fun part is that now I’m unsure of what had actually happened. My wife and I don’t want him around my two daughters just in case. When I told him this he told my dad and pops is losing his shit, accusing me of destroying the family without any proof. I think I’m doing the right thing. Even if my brother didn’t do anything, he’s a grown man and he’ll live. Has anyone gone through something like this
