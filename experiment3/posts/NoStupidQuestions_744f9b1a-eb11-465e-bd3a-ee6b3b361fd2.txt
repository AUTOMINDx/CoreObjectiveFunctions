Is this mansplaining?
Stuck at an airport so lots of random people drinking at one of their bars.

A woman comes up to the bar and orders a tall glass of Cabernet.

Bartender asks for $20.

Another dude and myself comment on how expensive that is. 

Said woman is obviously offended, thanks us for mansplaining, and bounces out. 

Maybe I'm just from a different socioeconomic class as said woman, but I think $20 for a drink of anything is robbery. 

Were other dude and I mansplaining?

Edit: don't know if I'm doing this right as it's literally my first ever post on reddit. Thanks everyone for their responses and feedback. About to depart so won't be able to respond to anything for at least a few hours.  Moral of the story I suppose is that everyone is different, everyone can read what you say differently, and when in doubt do not comment on the price of beverages.
