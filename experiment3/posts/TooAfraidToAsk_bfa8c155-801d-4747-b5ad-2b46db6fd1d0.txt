Do people with ugly kids know they have ugly kids?
My wife and I were discussing this tonight and we got into a little debate about it. Now I know being “ugly” is subjective and everyone is beautiful in their own way, but I’m sure everyone here has met someone where there’s a general consensus that the individual is not good looking. Do the parents of these people recognize that their child is…less than pretty?
