cleaned my room
i finally found the motivation and energy to clean my room. it hasn’t been cleaned in weeks, maybe months, and my laundry was piling up, trash was piling up, random items were lying on my bed even while sleeping.. it just became absolutely atrocious. currently still in the middle of finishing up, but i’m kinda proud that i finally had a bit of an accomplishment :)
