Do you respond to compliments with mania?
Anytime I get complimented, or win at anything I get this feeling like I feel like god. Like Iâ€™m just better than anyone else. If you were to view me in a third person perspective at that time I literally sound like an anime villain in the makings. 

Anyone else?
