Is it okay to just think about your engineering job as an actual job that pays the bills but nothing more?
Growing up, sure I was interested in engineering and I still am but I have also started to find other things interesting such as photography and traveling. I see the job that I have as a way to pay the bills and enjoy a bit on the side. Reading some of the posts or the comments on this subreddit about how people are extremely passionate about their job/engineering interests and I find it hard to relate to such content. 

Is that normal? I'd like to know different opinions and perspectives. Thank you.
