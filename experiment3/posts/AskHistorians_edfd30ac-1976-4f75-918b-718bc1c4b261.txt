Was "bubblegum flavour" ever l supposed to taste like something else?
The classic "bubblegum flavour" is distinctive but, to me, is not particularly reminiscent of anything in nature.

Was the flavour based on something else? 

Would it have been recognizable as an imitation of a different food when it was developed or became popular?
