taurus suns not expressing/ answering?
so i’ve noticed a pattern with my taurus sun friends that they are NO confrontational at all and that they ghost a lot? i’m talking about 5 taurus friends who follow this pattern. they also tend to feel hurt a lot and take things quite personally?

i am saggitarius and im completely opposite. im super confrontational and i need to let everything out in conversation.

does this has to do with astrology? tips?  i’ve read that we sags get on taurus nerves a lot and make them behave toxic (but it was on superficial magazines)
