Any tips or tricks to avoid bad GERD symptoms when you plan to drink alcohol?
During the holidays I have plans with friends family which will most likely involve drinking a few nights in a row. I rarely ever drink because of my GERD and am not looking forward to the acid reflux and stomach issues the following days. Anyone on here have any tricks to manage or lower the acid reflux effects from alcohol? Whether it be taking certain acid reflux medication at specific time before drinking or any certain alcohol beverages that are better for GERD. Anything is appreciated, obviously not drinking too much is always my goal and thatâ€™s what I will probably end up doing but just checking if anyone has any breakthrough tricks for drinking while having this awful condition, thanks in advance.
