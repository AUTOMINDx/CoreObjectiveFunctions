Inflation effects on financial markets
Hey, I'm a student of Economics and Finance and since I've learnt something about Economics, this is the first time I'm experiencing big inflation. I wanted to ask you which are the effects of inflation on financial markets (especially stock market) and also the effects of the most likely policies that governments would implement to stop it. Thank you :)
