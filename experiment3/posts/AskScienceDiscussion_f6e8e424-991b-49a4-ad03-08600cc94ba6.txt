Could water desalination, vertical farming and indoor agriculture prevent Human extinction/complete societal collapse in the event of ecological disaster?
Many suspect that if we don't drastically reign in our harmful behaviours very soon, we risk triggering a cascade of positive tipping points. In an absolute worst case scenario this may lead to a mass extinction event on a similar level to the Great Dying.

From my understanding, as devastating as Global Warming itself is, it's the scarcity of food and water that such a rapid ecological deterioration entails that truly threatens Humanity's long-term survival. Or at the very least, the survival of our civilisation.

How far could water desalination and sustainable indoor farming go in solving those things? From what I've heard both are within our technological capacity and it's more a matter of funding then anything that's holding them back.

In a worst case scenario: Could those technologies help keep Humanity and Human society alive should the worst come to pass On what level would they need to be expanded?
