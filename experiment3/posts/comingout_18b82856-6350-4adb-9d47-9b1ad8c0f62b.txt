Considering casually coming out in my government class assignment
In my \[17 M\] US Government class (high school 12th grade), we are currently studying the US Supreme Court, how it operates, and the impact that landmark cases can have on our society. Our assignment for the weekend was to write about one case that was either recently decided or that is older but has recently been in the news. We are then going to have a discussion about these cases on Monday.

My teacher expects that a lot of students are going to talk about Roe v. Wade, considering recent abortion ban attempts and the 6-3 conservative majority in the Court, so he challenged us to pick another important issue that the Court has recently been involved with.

My natural instinct as a gay person was to write about Bostock v. Clayton County, the case last year that determined that job discrimination on the basis of being LGBT+ was unconstitutional. There has been news going around that a lot of religious workplaces are trying to push back against the ruling, claiming that it violates their religious freedoms.

 (Link to one such example: [https://news.yahoo.com/texas-judge-says-religion-justifies-151553018.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAAEOzOHq2odeBILYVVbiKlIAR-oOrPUto7K9VKFaCVAwW-nZ4oxivIsR8hvMQrmpyjqcDUhimixKTb\_D4b2vnJHs7imlgxsHSEeY94OWfIkYwvl3wNC6gxskpHB2xGq1CvJPRmigreNIJ9NBcHOv5q0iUPbmKz01vE7ktrj2LoP3G](https://news.yahoo.com/texas-judge-says-religion-justifies-151553018.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEOzOHq2odeBILYVVbiKlIAR-oOrPUto7K9VKFaCVAwW-nZ4oxivIsR8hvMQrmpyjqcDUhimixKTb_D4b2vnJHs7imlgxsHSEeY94OWfIkYwvl3wNC6gxskpHB2xGq1CvJPRmigreNIJ9NBcHOv5q0iUPbmKz01vE7ktrj2LoP3G))

This news was so disgusting to me that I knew I had to address it, given this opportunity to bring LGBT+ issues to the spotlight in my class. Part of the assignment is to discuss our personal opinions on the case in question, so I plan to casually come out as gay and explain how ideas like these literally make me worry about my future and feel despair that some people are okay with putting my entire livelihood at stake just because I happen to like men (which, by the way, should not and does not 100% define me). I've been aching to mention it for a while, especially since I've been hearing a lot of homophobic and transphobic comments around my school that I want to play a role in stopping, if I somehow can. Perhaps me coming out will make another closeted student (cuz I and one other person that I know of can't possibly be the only LGBT people in our grade) feel more welcome and comfortable in their own skin. 

Do you guys think this is worth doing? Any advice? I'm really excited but nervous at the same time.

Btw my parents already know I'm gay and support me, so don't worry about "the school might call your parents" or something like that.
