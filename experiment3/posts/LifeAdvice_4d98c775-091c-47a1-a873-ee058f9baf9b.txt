How do I handle a difficult coworker?
I have had the worst two days.

I'm a SPED para in a public school, about to start my apprenticeship, and the classroom teacher I work with has, apparently, held animosity against me since I started my job. 

Yesterday I completed a task in a way she didn't like, and she gaslit me and intentionally made me feel stupid, rather than talking to me like an equal. I didn't have time to bring it to her attention, so I came to work early to have a talk with her. The discussion didn't go well. She was very defensive, hostile, and was raising her voice and cutting me off. She then discussed how she doesn't like my character, even though I've never really had the chance to get to know her. I was blindsided because I thought we had a good working relationship, which I'm now second-guessing.

At this point, I said we should wait and talk with my administrator. We did, but she had arrived early to tell her how "hostile and aggressive" I had been this morning...which was totally piss. I told her that it hurt me the way she spoke to me yesterday, and it upset me when she gaslit me, and then she turned my feelings against me and gaslit me again. lol.

In the end, I told her I wanted to develop our relationship and I'm sorry that my character has been intolerable. I felt there were misunderstandings and assumptions made when we really don't know each other well, yet. She didn't say anything and left. 

She didn't speak to me the rest of the day, and later, I had taken requests from coworkers for Starbucks as a Christmas gift from me. The teacher turned down my offer saying "I'll have my own coffee, from home". I have to work close by her the rest of the school year but I'm already dreading the thought. 

Other than "kill her with kindness" and "keep a paper trail" does anyone have any advice to tolerating difficult coworkers?
