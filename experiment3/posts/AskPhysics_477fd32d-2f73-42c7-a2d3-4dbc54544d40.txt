Why do atoms want to bond?
I know this sounds like a stupid question. I know atoms typically prefer a full octet. 
But as I’m studying biology and I am learning about Gibbs free energy and entropy, I began to wonder why atoms bond.
Wouldn’t it be more preferable to to not bond. Even more, wouldn’t it be more preferable to not even have atoms in the first place. Wouldn’t that be more disordered?
