Doesn’t Time Dilation render light speed travel useless if not straight up detrimental?
Let me elaborate if I fly at light speed for an hour then 20years pass on earth. So really it felt like an hour but 20years have passed. I hate the point of getting somewhere fast if time still passed at disproportional rate. Someone going xspeed to do the same trip for 20 years arrives at the same time so it really isn’t faster.
