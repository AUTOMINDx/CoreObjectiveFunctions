It's mostly in the title, but what happened? Did they never mean to trace their rich friends or what? Not one thing has gone through that really impacts the rich at all besides helps them and its been one attempt or breakthrough after another to put a squeeze on the people who can hardly get by a it is. Don't try to say I'm saying the other side is any better. But at least they don't seem to so blatantly lie to us. Their lies are easier to see through at least.
