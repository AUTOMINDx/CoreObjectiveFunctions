CPTSD recovery is like full time job
I find the recovery takes so much effort it's crazy. Just like me not being in triggered state requires so much effort like

\- avoiding toxic people

\- creating calm, safe and clean enviroment

\- managing my life- schedule, appointments, work,...

\- trying to carve lot of time to grief/rest and not judge myself for it

\- slowly trying to do the stuff i want - like to paint, journal

\- cook myself healthy meals and eating 3x a day (that itself is such a chore)

\- trying to be adult and non reactive to other people's bullshit

\- not personalising other people toxicity as me being shitty human

\- trying to be kind and gentle to myself and find wholesome things instead of giving into the chaos of the media etc.

\- attending to support groups/ therapy

\- not running away from my painful emotions

Like, no wonder this shit (recovery) takes years and years. Never knew human's spirit can be so complex and repairing mental damage is more delicate work than repainting the Sistine Chapel.

edit: thank you all for the kind words, hope you guys will get the peace and happiness you deserve.
