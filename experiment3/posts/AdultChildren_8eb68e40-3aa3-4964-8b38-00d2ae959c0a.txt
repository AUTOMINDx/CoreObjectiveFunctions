Approval Seeking?
This sucks.  
An ex and I broke up two years ago. She ended it, but it very likely for the best (like the way best), as it was kind of dysfunctional. It was a turbulent relationship what with my co-dependence and her narcissism. This is one of those cases where my rational self knows that this was a good thing for me and her; but my heart stubbornly refuses to listen.

Anyway, she came to weekend event for a group we are in and brought her man along. It was good to see her, but it also hurt like you wouldn't believe. Now I can stop thinking about her and fantasizing about getting back together - even though I know that 1) she doesn't want to 2) it wouldn't be a good thing 3) I don't really want to.  

When I play this little fantasy game, I am doing it with some idealized fiction of who she is not who she really is. AND I KNOW IT!!!! This is fucking sucks. I don't know why I am doing this to myself. Then I beat myself up for feeling this way and go right back to thinking about her.  I feel like I desperately want her approval/love, and I don't know why I do (you know, except for the whole trauma bond she created with me when we were together)!!!  


God, grant me the strength!
