My mom said that people who talk about toxic parenting are just people in a cult trying to take people away from their family values
I can't make this up



EDIT: It breaks my heart how much people can relate to this.  But it's also comforting that we understand each other and that we're not alone in this like I know so many of us used to feel like we were. I hope we all continue to find healing.
