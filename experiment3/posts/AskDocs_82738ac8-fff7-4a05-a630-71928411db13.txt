Is metastasis a death sentence?
This is not for me, but for a family friend. F60, around 160cm tall, has breast cancer in the past but had it treated. 

She was feeling a lot of discomfort in her abdomen, and thought maybe she had a stomach bug that did not go away, but upon further inspection, the doctors found out that she has stage 3 ovary cancer that has spread to her peritoneum and another organ that I do not recalk at the moment. 

Is this gonna be it? Is it a death sentence? We're scared for her and for those that need her. She's an animal rescuer that acts pretty much alone and has 5+ dogs that need her. My family helps when possible, but she's been nursing those strays back to health mostly by herself. She's a good soul and I'd hate to see her go like this.
