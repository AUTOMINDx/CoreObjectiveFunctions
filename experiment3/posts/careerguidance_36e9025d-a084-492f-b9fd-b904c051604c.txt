Unemployed for more than a year, advice?
I messed up big time. I graduated college this past May with an engineering degree. I haven't had work experience since the start of the pandemic (back in March 2020). Since graduation, I have been doing basically nothing and procrastinating. I've probably sent enough applications to count on one hand. I feel like I've screwed up my whole life and wasted all that I've worked for. I've been really struggling with anxiety/depression and it's been through the roof, but I've been getting help with it. I don't know what to do and have no words really.

I'm scared if a potential employer were to ask me what I've been up to since graduation (basically nothing). How should I approach it if it is brought up? What should I be doing and how do I stop the bleeding?

What should I start doing asap? Any advice/suggestions or stories?
