[FL] I was exposed to COVID on the job and am being punished for it
On December 3rd while delivering for Amazon as a Flex driver I encountered a maskless customer who told me directly they had COVID. 

I reported the incident immediately and my account was deactivated for 14 days, unpaid.

I have reached out several times and the only option is to apply with the Emergency Assistance Foundation, which I did the very next morning.

Unfortunately the EAF claims that for a week they have been waiting for Amazon to simply verify that I am indeed a driver, and as such my application has gone nowhere and I have no way to make a living.

It's unbelievable to me that I can be punished financially for a hazard encountered on the job. It seems that I shouldn't have reported the situation at all, trying to do the right (and safe) thing is ruining me.

I have sent numerous emails to Amazon which all come back with automated replies about have I need to "contact the EAF for all fund related activities" EVEN after writing multiple paragraphs about what the EAR has told me and how Amazon themselves are responsible.

Not only this but this issue goes WAY BEYOND just needing help with an EAF claim. I was EXPOSED TO A HAZARD on the job and for this I have lost income. I am considering a lawsuit at this point but am unsure what legal ground I have to stand on.

Unfortunately the system is DESIGNED to be this way, it's why they call us "contractors", as a way to strip us of any possible protections. However, when you make 12k delivering for Amazon almost every day you MUST SOMEHOW be entitled to the SMALLEST amount of protection, such as compensation, or s the very least not punishment for encountering something scary that you risk every time you start your shift.

Can Support just ghost me like this? Is there a government agency I can report this to? Im legitimately stunned and have no idea what I can do next.
