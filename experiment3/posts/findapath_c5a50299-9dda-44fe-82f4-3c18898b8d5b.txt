What jobs exist that offer low work hours or frequent days off/vacations, with benefits?
For example: teaching (summer/holiday break), firefighter (48hr on, 96hr off). 

Benefits are a requirement. I can’t keep up with the regular 8-5 job that breaks me with nothing but the winter holiday break to give me a reason to live. It’s simply not a good enough reason for me. 

Edit: To be clear, looking especially for jobs where you TRULY are working less overall. Not just a basic 40hr/wk job with good benefits (which in the US is nothing…basically enough to equal one 2wk vacation/year plus a day or two per month at best), but a job that changes how we think of jobs. Firefighter is a good example, even though it seems like you’re working more hours, because you’re on call 2 days per week but not necessarily working, with a 5 day weekend. Another example would be certain European jobs, 6wk on/2wk off for the entire school year with summer off. A monthly day or two of paid holiday plus a week or two paid off per year is a joke. I refuse to live only a few days per year. I want time to do my own thing, invest in hobbies, be with my loved ones…live a worthwhile life.
