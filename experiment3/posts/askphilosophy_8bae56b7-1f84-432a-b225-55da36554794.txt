What book would you recommend for a 15 year old who wants to get into philosophy?
I tried diving into the deep end and start with Soren Kierkegaardâ€™s magnum opus; Either/or. But I found it to be to complex for me especially in the chapter where person A kept talking about Mozart and what makes a piece of work a classic. Can you give me a less complex, but still a good philosophy book that would suit me better.
