Worst family ever.
I have a sister she's 18 years old and she has a 3 year old son. So today is a total mess. My 3 year old nephew fell in a 16 step staircase. This happened so suddenly. I was attending an online class. And I heard a loud thud outside my room. Then I saw my little nephew down the first floor of our house crying. 

I hugged him, seeing he was in that state, his head was reddish, and he had bruises all over his legs. And that situation of course I was mad and I told my sister to why she didn't notice her son fell. 

And all she said was "I was on my phone talking to someone" And also said "he's a 3 year old he shouldn't cry. It's a good thing he didn't bust his head."

I'm so mad. Honestly. And my two brothers who were also at the same time&amp;place didn't even bother because they were playing videogames...

Idk why they're mad at her too when they're also reckless for leaving a 3 year old child by himself. in fact, I'm the only one that should be mad because of their stupidity.

Ohh and I forgot to say, when comforting the child they keep yelling at him for doing that??? They're blaming a child for doing that? When they're 18 and at legal age that should supervise him.
