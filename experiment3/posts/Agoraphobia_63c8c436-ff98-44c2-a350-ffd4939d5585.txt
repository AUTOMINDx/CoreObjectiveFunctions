Was gonna bail but I pushed myself to go to my relatives house. Nervous rnâ€¦
There right now and feeling quite nervous but tryna relax. Have the dry mouth symptom and shakes but telling myself it will be okay as it always does when I settle in on an exposure.

Edit: went well and we didnâ€™t have to stay too long anyway. So tired now though. Felt some type of weird guilt when catching up on life because I had to pretend like Iâ€™m not an agoraphobic whoâ€™s done nothing social this year ðŸ˜«. Iâ€™m like kind of embarrassed for myself in that aspect.

Edit 2: today I went to another house for a different family gathering. Did not have much anxiety at all! I even fell asleep for a little bit there.
