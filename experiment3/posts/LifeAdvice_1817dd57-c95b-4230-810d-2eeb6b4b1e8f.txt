Reaching a breaking point
Hello. Anonymous here. I work full time, my wife works part time running her own contract business, she doesn't have many contracts yet and while her income for sure helps, and she contributes in every other way imaginable, my income covers the large majority of our bills and expenses. This post is not about her. 

I crashed my car yesterday. Work has had me so exhausted that I've been struggling to stay awake during the day, and yesterday I dozed off behind the wheel and hit a tree. 4 hours later a woman ran a stop sign and T-boned my wife, totaling our only other vehicle. We are both physically fine. My job has been making me miserable for years and the pressure since my wife started her own business to be the sole breadwinner is crushing. Nothing anywhere near me or remote that I am qualified for even pays remotely close to what I make now. So many bills. 2 cars to replace. 3 mouths to feed, I feel like I'm on the fast track to a breakdown and I don't know what to do. Scared to leave my job, scared to stay at my job, don't know what to do
