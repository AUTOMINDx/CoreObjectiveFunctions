Really Embarrassing and Personal Question
28M, Canadian

Ok, don't judge me too harshly. I don't know what I was thinking either. To date, my biggest regret.

So, when I was a kid, I was taking a bath and... I actually inserted a bar of soap into my rectum. I'd push it out and do it again. Shortly, the pushing it out part was happening involuntarily. That was a really weird feeling, but its something I've never felt before. Long, gross story short, I sorta continued doing that until about 5 or 6 years ago. I suspect it mightve been a brain addiction. Why? I don't know but looking back it sparked behaviors in me that were almost compulsive. But now, my anal muscles are very weak. Not incontinent, but sometimes I can't stop a fart when I really should be able to. The biggest worry though is that whenever I go to the bathroom, without fail I get a partial rectal prolapse. And when I push even a little, I get a big one. Like, softball size. It doesn't hurt but it does have me worried. I doubt my muscles can fully recover if that keeps happening, and I would really not like to have a prolapse and shove it back in when going to the bathroom. My question is, is this fixable? Or am I sorta screwed? And what sort of long term complications can come of this? Sorry for gross post...
