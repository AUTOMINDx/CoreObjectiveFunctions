How do you stop living for the therapy hour?
It’s like an obsession. I literally count down the days until my 50 minute session each week. How can I stop this? My (new) therapist doesn’t allow more than one session per week, and even if she did, I wouldn’t be able to afford it. Please tell me how to stop the obsession...
