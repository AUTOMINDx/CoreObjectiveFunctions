[CAN] Employer pressuring me about equipment return
I gave my two weeks notice last Monday. I also let my boss know that I would be flying to Europe for a week after my last day and to get me the equipment return information before I leave (I'm remote in a different city). He said he would coordinate the return.

I still haven't gotten any return information and I leave tomorrow. I told my manager that if I don't get the information it will need to wait until I return. 

My manager says I can't hold onto the equipment for a week (it will cause him problems) and wants me to leave it with my parents and he will coordinate with them. My parents are elderly and I really don't want them dealing with this or my manager/company. Also if any mistakes happened it's unclear who would be responsible (I once gave a router to a roommate to return. He said he returned it and the company said they never got it and wanted to charge me $350. It was a nightmare to deal with).

I drew a line and said to get me the information today or it will need to wait. Is this the right strategy?

From my perspective it was their responsibility to get me the information on time and a week isn't the end of the world. I'm certainly not going to cancel my flight or try and get my elderly parents to sort this out.
