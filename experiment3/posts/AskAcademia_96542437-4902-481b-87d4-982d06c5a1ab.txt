Is it possible to make corrections to a thesis after it has been defended?
I realized that I made a mistake in one of the arguments of my master thesis, fortunately for me, it is not something very noticeable and does not change the conclusions of the project or what I wanted to say, and my advisor already graded me with a relatively good grade. However, I have to defend it before the rest of the jurors in a few days, and I do not know if they will notice it (to which I can argue that it is something correctable and that does not affect the conclusions), or if they will not notice it and will give me another type of corrections or comments.

My question is, in case they do not notice it, would it be ok if after the presentation and before submitting the thesis again to the faculty, I make that correction? 

I do not know if the question is ethical or disciplinary, if it is ethical, I would run the risk, since I have fully clear that it is not something that affects the conclusions and that I can correct, if it is disciplinary, I do not think I run the risk but I do not know if it is then I would like to know what you think.

Greetings and thanks in advance!
