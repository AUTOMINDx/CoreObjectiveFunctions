Cant meet any people who I get along with really well
23 M college student in my last year. I just don't get along with anyone, not on my team, not in classes, not around town, and I consider myself an outgoing guy. I go to school in LA and it feels like im just on a different wave length with everyone and we all have different expectations or something. I just need people who are fun to be around yet push me to be the best version of myself yet I am stuck without any passion outside of my sport and no direction after college. My "friend group" in college would rather go fuck some chick they will never talk to again after a few nights instead of spend time on the weekend building memories with someone who can be life long friends with them/me/us. I also really try to get to know other people by making efforts to hangout but nobody ever wants to do anything, especially on my team. Seems like everyone in college wants to get shitfaced and just get in each others pants because we live in such a sexually repressed culture and this is the first time in life kids get freedom. Im glad my I share my sport with my team but I feel like there is more to this experience then sharing just that sport with them? Fortunately ive saved enough to travel and buy time after school but I feel like this can't be the epitome of life. Days bleed into each other and  the company I am around has me feeling left unsatisfied. Maybe I need to move locations? I love hanging with older people around 30 and love their worldliness but I feel too young for them to take me seriously and rarely find myselves in there company.
