Is there a silly "non-vulgar" slang term for a women's genitals? Like how men have "pp"?
This question randomly came to mind while I was talking to my boyfriend. The word "pussy" just doesn't fit the tone of most scenarios, ya know? It's just not a word I feel comfortable dropping casually? Whereas if you say "pp" everyone will just laugh along without it feeling too out of left field. 

Am I over-thinking this? Do I just not know enough slang? Am I on to something? I have no clue lmao

Edit: Holy crap I woke up to this post blowing up. Thanks for the rewards and comments! Unfortunately there's well over 1k now so I won't be able to reply to all of them. But I appreciate your efforts all the same (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.)

Edit 2: I just want to clarify that when I wrote "'non-vulgar' slang term" that I did not mean to include "vagina" there because I don't see it as slang. I see it as the "proper term" for it if that makes sense. I may not like the way that word sounds but I don't think there's anything really *wrong* with it aside from that. I don't think it's vulgar, I just don't find it to be a "casual" word? It's probably just me tbh. If you disagree with me, that's totally fine!
