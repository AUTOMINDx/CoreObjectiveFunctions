What's the deal with putting stuff on ResearchGate?
It has come to my attention that some people upload their dissertations, theses and other non-peer reviewed work on Research gate. I've also seen that these get their own DOI number and also appear on google scholar. What is the deal with this? Is there any downside to uploading interesting research findings in this way?
