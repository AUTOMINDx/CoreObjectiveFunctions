Do you sometimes feel that you don't have anything interesting to say?
Sometimes I think that I never learned how to communicate my needs and thoughts to be seen and be heard. And when someone listens it's not compelling enough. I tend to cram everything into 2 sentences to not scare people off. But I still do.
