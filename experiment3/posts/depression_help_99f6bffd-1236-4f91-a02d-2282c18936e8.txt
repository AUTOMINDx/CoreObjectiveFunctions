Is it okay that I don’t want to go to college right now?
I am 18f. I’m from Idaho and currently at one of the universities here. I’ve always been a very strong student. I got 23,000 in scholarships this past year. And I was always super involved in the community. But this semester has kicked the ever living shit out of me. So much had happened and I am constantly stressed and depressed. I sometimes have really intense suicidal thoughts as well. I want to take a break to heal my mental and get more financially stable. But I feel like I would be a failure if I took a break. Like I would immediately become someone of unimportance. Is it okay to take a break from school? I really would like some advice on this please.
