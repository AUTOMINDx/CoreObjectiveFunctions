Do you feel like an adult or an overgrown child?
I have my own place, pay bills and stuff but I honestly feel like I’ve just been wingin it, is it because I don’t have kids or is there a certain age where things click?

More context: I’m in my 20’s have had my own place since 18, did a year of college and really want to go back, had a good 3 yr relationship that ended in her leaving me for some guy in his 40’s but we still hook up. Mentally I feel the same as I did when I was 18 except I’m less social, women call me cute and I literally could say I’m 30 or 16 and no one would spot the difference.

I’m responsible as far as rent paid and self sufficient, but I do the bare minimum, I have no drive

I don’t fit in with most adults because of certain life experiences and I damn sure don’t fit in with actual kids either, I also live in a small city which probably doesn’t help
