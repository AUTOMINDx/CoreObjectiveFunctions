Whenever I wake up, it feels like yesterday didn’t happen
It’s kind of hard to go through daily life due to how fake everything feels. Like I know that my friends are my friends and I’m a student but it feels too unreal for me to keep grounded and interact with people at school. To top it all, every time I wake up, I know what happened the day before but it feels like they never happened. I was too detached at school yesterday to a point where everyone was alarmed and I even took three painkillers just so maybe I might get some sort of kick from it- I can remember all of these but I just can’t believe that they happened, it’s all so foggy and it makes it so hard to go to school every day.
