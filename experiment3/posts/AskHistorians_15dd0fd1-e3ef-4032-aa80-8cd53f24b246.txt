Israel's legal definition of a Jew is the same that was used by the Nazis. Is this a coincidence, or was it intended?
In order to immigrate to Israel, an individual has to establish his Jewish heritage. This can be done by proving that at least one grandparent was Jewish. Based on the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935, a German would be considered a "mongrel" if he had one Jewish grandparent, and would therefore be subjected to second-class citizenship. Is this parallel a coincidence, or did the founders of Israel decide on their definition of a Jew based on the Nuremberg Laws?
