What theories do I need to know before understanding zizek?
I want to read more about Marxism extended for modern times (I heard he wrote about something like that) but I'm absolutely clueless on this, I'm a total beginner in political theory. I know the basic notions of neoliberalism, postmodernism, etc... But I'd like to more formally understand them.

So to achieve this, what theories should I study before I can read zizek's work (among others, I'm taking suggestions for related literature) and in what order?

If this isn't the right sub, where should I ask? Thanks in advance!
