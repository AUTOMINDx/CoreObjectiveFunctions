I'm too sensitive, and I need advice
I'm a very caring and compassionate person, and i feel like one of my greatest assets is that i can sense other people's shift in emotions. I can smell sadness and irritation for miles away, and that's really helpful when my friends need someone to talk to.

However, the other side of the coin is that I'm being to sensitive towards other people's feelings and opinions, and it's very painful. If someone criticizes me i take it very personal, and it absolutely destroys me. 

If i say something hurtful, which I often do due to tasteless humor, and someone gets hurt, it absolutely breaks me. Even after I've apologized and they forgive me. I just start to hate myself for days, sometimes weeks.

Conflict terrifies me as well. If someone disagrees with me, i somehow take it personally and it hurts me, because I feel like they dislike ME and not my opinions.

How can I work on this? It's extremely tiring and it feels like I'm constantly living on an emotional rollercoaster. 
Has anyone been like this and then been able to grow thicker skin?

Thanks
