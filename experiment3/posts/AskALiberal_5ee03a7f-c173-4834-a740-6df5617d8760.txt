What is your opinion on student loans being restarted?

Most responses basically say to just repay the loan. While I fully understand this, I argued that loans are unfairly stacked on millennials and how most of use were forced to go to college (or at least lied to about how much we could make) and are stuck in a debt cycle that can be very difficult to get out of. 

I also mentioned how we have money for war but very little for education, as if one seems to be more important than the other in this country. 

Do you think student loans should be forgiven? I would at least want there to be no interest on it.
