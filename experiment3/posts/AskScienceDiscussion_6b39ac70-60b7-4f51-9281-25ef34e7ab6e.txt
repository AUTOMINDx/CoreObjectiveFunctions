Some arguments about how the covid mrna vaccines not being ready for the public?
Not an antivaxer. I got my 2 doses and a booster shot. But, what are some biological/biochemical arguments one can make about the vaccine not being ready for the public? (It can something such as critically attacking how mRNA vaccines are made). Obv some aspects are not knowing the long-term side affects.

TLDR;  is there something let's say "not perfect" about the mRNA vaccine that you would wish to change?
