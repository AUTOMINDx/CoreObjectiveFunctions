At a low point seeing this as the end
Hey everyone I'm (28m) just looking for advice or help or a place to vent I don't really know I'm just at such a low point in life where I find everything pointless and miserable I feel like Im loving groundhog day over and over working a job I hate with no escape no life outside work even on the weekends sitting alone all day everything feels like such a heavy load I want to give up I feel like I have no future, I hate this life..
