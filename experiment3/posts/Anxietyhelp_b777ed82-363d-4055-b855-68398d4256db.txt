Anxiety
I really hate the holidays.. it gives me so much anxiety. I hate decorating because the thought of cleaning it all up afterwards sucks. Then trying to plan out what kinda dinner to make.. why do we have to have a big dinner? It's all so stressful. Then gifts. I'm so tired of stuff and things. All I want is to be heard and understood but I just feel like an outsider.
