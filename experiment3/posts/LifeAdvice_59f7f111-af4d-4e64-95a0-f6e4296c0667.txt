Very demotivated and very sad
I really do feel demotivated I’m from third world country where it’s very hard to get a job without an okay from a very influential person and on top of that the inflation is through the roof my brother is very educated person who did masters from UK and he’s been jobless ever since coming back from Uk all the saving parents had they spent him and rightfully so because he is such a bright student but we had to call him back after studies because parents were getting very on saving and hes been jobless for last 5-6 years and trust me he applied everywhere (my brother is not the issue here but had to give a little background) but this is nothing younger generations is committing sucide because of no jobs and high inflation 

I was very self aware of the situations and had enough experience from my brothers jobless years and his heart breaks for me to know that I’m not bright and I couldn’t get a job the best job I could get would be the printing guy or office boy the and in my country that would mean 140$ a month that’s excluding taxes transport cost and day to day cost 

So I started learning programming didn’t told no body at my home because I knew no one would understand and tbh I was 100% with my luck nothing would go right but it did. It really did and I can not thank God enough for giving a failure like me such skill and I was making more than 3x what I would be making at a decent job I paid electricity bills. Food bills. Phone bills and other bills and I would order soup for my whole family I would never order food without ordering for everyone else so no one feels left out because that’s just how I am and I’m saving for future too and I was finally thinking to myself like dude you are gonna use this talent and better the lives of people around you in your family and I would always tell my mom like mom things are finally changing we could have never imagined this and this is such a blessing 

But today I heard my sister and mother having conversation and the way they talked about me showed me how all my accomplishments meant nothing to them and that demotivated me to whole another level I spent the whole day today just thinking about it because it hurt me so much like if you overhear your strangers talking back you find comfort in friends if you over hear friends you find comfort in family but who do you find comfort in when your own family doesn’t support you this is why I came to Reddit I didn’t know anywhere else
