Things my therapist said that may help you too.
I started seeing a therapist a couple months ago to work through years of childhood abuse. I’ve struggled to find a therapist for years that actually encourages me being NC (almost 18 months! Yay!) and validates my abuse instead of trying to make me “let it go.” He has said two things over the past few sessions that have really affected me positively and I thought maybe it may help someone else too.

TLDR; take what resonates, leave what doesn’t. 

1. Upon mentioning that I sometimes waiver and consider going back to contacting my mom, my therapist said this gem:

“When you were a kid, you NEEDED a mom. You didn’t necessarily always have a mom because you were playing that role, but you still NEEDED a mom. Now that you are an adult, you WANT a mom. A want and a need are not the same thing. You can want something that’s not good for you, but you don’t need it. Don’t give her back the power you reclaimed.”

2. I mentioned that I often mourn my childhood because it was ruined by abuse from my nmom. He said this in response:

“When you’re a kid, your emotional brain is kind of all you have. And now that you’re an adult, you still have that part of your brain. Your childhood is forever. You don’t have to mourn it completely because you can still experience your childhood. Your emotions are pieces of that.”


I’m not sure if that resonates with anyone else, but I hope it can help at least someone. Even a little! 💕
