A Christmas miracle
Two days ago, I didn’t know where this was heading tbh, and she didn’t either.

Long story short, I came out as a trans gal to one of my exes the other day, and ever since that has occurred, her and I have grown stronger again, and we are now trying our luck at dating once again…

Seeing that she once literally told me “As long as THEY (meaning LGBTQ+) stay in their lane, I’m cool with it”, and literally doing a 180 months later… it’s shocking.

She has done nothing but reassure me that she wants me for “me”, and nothing but…

She has reassured me that we will do whatever it takes to get past all of these hardships regarding my NParents and their LGBTQ+ -phobic views… considering that they have a closeted trans gal living with them, and an ex that was once straight, now lesbian, in a long-distance relationship…

She even discussed my bottom dysphoria with me, and wants to accommodate my wants and needs with her own… 😊 (She doesn’t even realize how happy I am because of it…)

WHO KNEW???

I just can’t wait to spend time with her on my birthday in Disney here in 2 months… 🥰

It’s going to be literal magic! 🎉 

Your friendly neighborhood trans gal,

River
