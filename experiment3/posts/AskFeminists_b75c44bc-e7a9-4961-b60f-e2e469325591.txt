What is one issue you see posted in progressive men's groups that is framed as being unique to boys/men but in reality is an issue that also commonly affects girls/women?
One issue I see posted often in progressive men's groups is the idea the media intentionally erases the crime of rape against boy victims and their women teachers due to the belief boys can't be victims of sexual assault by women. Instead of using terms like rape or sexual assault it's replaced by "had sex with" or some variation of having a sexual relationship.

It would only take a few minutes of a web search to realize it's very common for the media to use some variation of "had sex with" in regards to student rape.  Below are just a few examples.  The victims in these examples are all female students.
