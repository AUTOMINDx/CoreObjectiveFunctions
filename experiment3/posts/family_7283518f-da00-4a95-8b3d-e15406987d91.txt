Christmas support
Would it be ok to start a post where we can support eachother through the holidays? I posted this a couple weeks ago on the Christmas Reddit but it got zero response so maybe wasnt the right place for it. I'm even more stressed than i was then. I'm in my mid thirties and i just want to use drugs at this point (and I'm not a drug user) cause i really don't know how to deal with the stress of family at the holidays.

Would it be helpful for others to share what they are going through? Some mutual support? It would be super helpful for me
