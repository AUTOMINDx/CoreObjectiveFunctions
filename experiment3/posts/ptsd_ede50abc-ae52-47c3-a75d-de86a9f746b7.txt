Anyone else have a loss of creativity after traumatic event? Any advice?
My whole childhood was filled with a lot of trauma, so in a way I was kind of used to it. But I used to be a really creative person. I used to play percussion and really loved painting. I used to be able to paint for like 10 hours straight. I would experience so much flow while painting and it was amazing. I never needed inspiration or anything. I could just create things without thought. It used to be such a good way for me to vent my emotions. It used to help me with all the traumas i had experienced up until college.

Then right when i got into college i entered into an abusive relationship. All kinds of abuse (physical, mental, and sexual). This was 10 years ago now. It really messed me up and I got ptsd and social anxiety from it all. I havent been able to paint  or be able to get into any other creative hobbies since that relationship though. I feel like the creative side of myself just died with that relationship. I want so badly to enjoy it the way i used to, but I have no idea how or if its possible. It honestly makes me really sad to think about. This was so important to me before that relationship.

Anyone else experience this? Any advice?
