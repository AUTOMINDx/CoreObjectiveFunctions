Agoraphobia linked to abuse?
Does anyone think their agoraphobia is linked to childhood and continued abuse? I grew up in a very dysfunctional family as the black sheep where my needs, thoughts, and feelings didn't matter and I was either an extension of my parents false grandiosity or I was nothing.

I'm almost 40 and have been housebound for 4 years now and I'm starting to wonder if this is all linked, can anyone relate?
