Trying to overcome fear
Hello, I am a 35 year old female (although I always felt very androgynous, I was never able to express that part of me without consequence, but thats a whole other issue). I have always been attracted to females, or anyone femme presenting I guess, but I've mostly only been with guys despite not being sexually attracted to them. The only relationship I had with a woman I had to keep secret and it just didn't work out. Deep down, I know I'm a lesbian and it brings me to tears because I married a man, who is my best friend and I don't want to leave him. I also don't have anywhere to go even if I had the courage to come out. I'm hoping to start therapy soon but I'm on a wait list and my mental health has been getting really bad. Is it possible to stay with him or will this secret eat me alive? I just feel lost and I've worked so hard to find someone I felt safe with, I'm so afraid to lose him. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. I'm just trying to stay hopeful.
