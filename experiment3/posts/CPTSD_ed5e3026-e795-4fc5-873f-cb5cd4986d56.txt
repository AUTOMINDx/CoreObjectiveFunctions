You have to be your own everything....
Whenever a therapist starts throwing acronyms at me, it sends a certain message. First off, acronyms being DBT, CBT, EMDR, abc, l-m-n-o-p... what have you. While I realize these things may be of value to some, the way it comes off to me is- "Weird Butterscotch, you had better learn to be your own everything- comfort yourself, deal with everything yourself and don't honor your emotions- stop those in their tracks because nobody wants to hear it. Self soothe, bitch, because nobody has ever and nobody WILL ever want to comfort you or validate your stupid, overblown emotions. You aren't worth love or care, so you better just learn to self regulate. Being loved and comforted is just a thing you're never gonna have- and even if you do- it will be transient at best. You are just going to have to be your own everything".

Does any of that make sense to anyone else?

Also, I apologize for the dramatics, but am still really in the thick of a damaging experience from a therapist who I foolishly trusted, for a time.
