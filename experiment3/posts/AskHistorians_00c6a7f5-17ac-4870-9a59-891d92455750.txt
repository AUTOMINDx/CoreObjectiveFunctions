Were black African slaves in the United States one step away from starvation, or well-fed because they were big investments?
I've read several accounts of what the diet of enslaved Africans in the United States was like. It varied by region — rice based in rice-growing areas. Corn-based elsewhere. They were often allowed to garden, and their diet included leafy greens, beans, watermelons, and a mix of other veggies and wild-caught fish (if they had a stream nearby).

But there seems to be disagreement among historians about the diet beyond that. Some claim that a slave working in the fields on a plantation was well fed because they were expensive investments that had to be maintained, and so ate 3500-4500 calories a day, though the food was pretty basic and often not of the best quality. These diets were probably nutritionally adequate. Some historians suggest that slaves ate better than poor whites.  

Others says that they were lucky to get 1,800 calories a day from cornmeal and pork fat. I find figures like that unlikely — I've done heavy labor on a farm, and I lost weight eating 3,000 calories a day. You'd quickly have a slave who couldn't work if you only fed them 1,800 calories a day.

So do we really not know how plantation owners thought about providing food for slaves? I'm sure there was variation. But there must have been something of a standard approach to make sure the slaves didn't quickly become decimated by malnutrition/weight loss. Why is there widespread disagreement among historians?
