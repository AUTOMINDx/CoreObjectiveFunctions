18M 130lbs 5’11 | There’s a worm in my eye
I was flossing and I felt an incredibly horrifying physical sensation of something moving around right at the front of my right eye. I looked and there I saw a section of what looked like a work. It was light brown. In the few days before this, I have been seeing gold sparkles and other flashes that have gotten more common. I live in a safe town with good water in North Carolina. The only other country I’ve been to outside of the US is Canada. I’ve been to my Grandmas house multiple times though not within the last 2.5 years. I’ve been to Vancouver 2.5 years ago where I stayed in a nice rental house. I am very careful with germs and what I eat. I have absolutely no idea how the fuck this happened but this is terrifying. What am I even supposed to do? I read that there are only like 160 recorded cases of something like this, but almost always are from third world countries. What do I fucking do?!?
