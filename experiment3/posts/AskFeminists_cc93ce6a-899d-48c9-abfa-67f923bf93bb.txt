As a male feminist, how can we combat the notion that feminism is misandrist?
I’ve been wondering about this as I’ve had to discuss this with friends and people online. The core is that there are those that shoot back with things like “feminism is only for women and anything that benefits men from it is purely coincidental” Ultimately, I’m an egalitarian as I believe we should all be equal regardless of gender. There are some really bad actors that bring down this movement though and unfortunately a lot of them are praised by the general public. 

I’m just trying to open a discussion here and ask this as it’s really been on my mind lately. Appreciate any advise and/or insight anyone has.

Thanks.
