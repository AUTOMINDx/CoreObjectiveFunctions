The best Christmas I've ever had
I went no contact a year and a half ago with my parents. Last Christmas I did a 14 hour shift so I didn't have to think about my first Christmas away from them. This year, I'm in the kitchen with my boyfriend and housemates making pancakes while they prep Christmas Dinner. There's no fighting, no shouting, no anxiety at all. We're listening to music, drinking, and chatting. It's the best Christmas I've ever had, and I'm savouring every minute of it!
