Anybody else physically attractive but unable to find someone cause of social awkwardness?
I am a 20 year old male and would consider myself to be relatively attractive (not like a ten but maybe a little over average) however I completely shut down around women, I can literally become best friends with a guy after talking for an hour but women? I just freeze up and act like a moron or get quiet and seem like a weirdo, I also think theyre often not accepting of my personality and mannerisms, this has caused me to ruin my chances with scores of women and I still havent had my first girlfriend. I know women are people too of course but trust me, knowing that does not help my situation. Anyone in a similar place or has gotten out of this situation? Is it all just luck? I cant take being alone anymore all I want is a significant other.
