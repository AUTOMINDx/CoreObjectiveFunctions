7 year old in need of a miracle.
My niece was in a accident 4 days ago and has very severe injuries to her brain stem and upper spine. If anyone knows of any good neuro surgeons or any doctor that would be willing to take a look at her MRI's it would be greatly appreciated. We are in the New England area of the United States. I have contacted the neurology center in Boston Children's hospital and they will taking a look at her MRI'S today. Grasping at straws here.
