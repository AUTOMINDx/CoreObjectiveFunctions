Am I (F28) being unreasonable for being annoyed my bf (M30) asked me to cook dinner for a date?
I’ve been seeing my bf for 2 months now. We have plans to hang out later this evening. He texted me earlier and asked if I could cook us dinner for tonight and bring it with me when I come. 

This rubbed me the wrong way, and makes me feel disrespected. I guess it’s just the lack of effort that turned me off. I’m coming to see him when it suits him, we’re going to stay at his place and watch a movie he wants to see, and I have to cook him dinner and lug it with me on the subway? 

Normally I really like cooking for others, in fact I’ve made and brought him a couple things already, but there’s something that really turns me off about being asked to cook. Especially because one of my biggest fears is being stuck in a relationship where I’m treated like a maid/mom. 

Am I totally off base here?
