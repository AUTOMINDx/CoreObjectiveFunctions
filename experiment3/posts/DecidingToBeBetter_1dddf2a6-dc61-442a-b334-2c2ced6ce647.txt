It has been quite some time that to few of my friends and relatives don't call me back specifically cousin's of same age group , sometimes I used to give them benefit of doubt and used to call back later on or may be on another occasion... 

To keep the relationship going, sometimes due to love and affection and also due to old memories of good time... I used to buy there excuse of being busy...

But now that's enough of that shit... 

I have decided to Not give another call as my previous call registered in there phone book when I have called them and to wait for there call back if they do it's good  and if they don't.. they have made there choice of not choosing to talk with me and that's it... 

I communicated this to my Mom as well as I am eldest of the siblings and to keep family united is kind of my responsibility ... 

I made a choice today to give only space in my life who have time for me and that's what I usually ask for .. I have never ever asked anyone any kind of help in terms of money or favour... And responded to people's need when they need me ... Always being helpful and selfless is costing me mine self respect and pride. 

It's really painful,my eyes are wet from yesterday when I have thought about this and decided to come to this conclusion.. it's alot of pain inside my heart now to decide not to communicate if I being ignored but .

I made a choice today and I hope it's going to make me better.
