Don’t try and off yourself using other people as the means of doing so, please.
So a while back when I was 16 my dad committed suicide, and it’s been tough but I’ve gotten past it and I know how to deal with it when it gets bad. But last week on his (my dads’s) birthday, a man tried to jump in front of my car on the highway to kill himself, and it’s brought back so many awful memories and nightmares. It’s all I’ve been able to think about and I’m just sad that it feels like I made all that progress just to be derailed by some rando with a death wish. I know it hasn’t undone the work I’ve had to do to help myself but sometimes it feels like it did. I just needed to get it off my chest and put it somewhere else for a while.
