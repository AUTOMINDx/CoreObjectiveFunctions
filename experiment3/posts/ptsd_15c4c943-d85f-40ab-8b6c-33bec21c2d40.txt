I think I have PTSD
I found my girlfriend early Friday dead from suicide
TW: details

I can't get it out of my head. her eyes had a film over them, the light reflected off of them and almost absorbed it, and now any time I see a reflection of a window or even my phone screen when it turns off I have this loop where I'm screaming. reaching for her body trying desperately to wake her up. I notice new details every time and I can even tell you where things in her room were. it genuinely feels like I'm there and it's honestly terrifying. 

what in the world am I supposed to do. how am I supposed to open up about it. everyone says get a therapist but I'm autistic and don't know how to talk to people at all let alone someone I've never met.

I can't take out my garbage without seeing her under the tree in my front yard. that's a new thing but I've slept maybe 6 hours in the past 4 days so idk if I'm just hallucinating? 

am I going to see her forever?
are there options where I can heavily medicate? I honestly don't care as long as I don't have to be there.

I'm sorry if this isnt the right subreddit. I'm just lost
