How to come off natural in a PhD interview?
hi everyone. I recently got an interview invite to one of my top programs for a PhD. I am insanely excited and stressed about it. they have already told the interviewees what questions to expect, which has given us both a blessing and curse in terms of preparation.

of course I prepared answers to these questions but I am worried about coming off as rehearsed/scripted, especially as I tend to get nervous and find it hard to maintain a natural flow.

any advice for introverted, anxious people to come off more natural or relaxed in interviews? thanks!
