Is the mindset of an NPC healthy?
NPC- non playable character. The automated characters in video games.

(22f) Two months ago, I randomly decided to delete my social media, cut off contact with my friends (I communicated that I needed a break), and got a second job so now I work 14hrs a day in retail. I disassociate/daydream all day and can do both jobs mostly on autopilot.
After work, I go home and I sit. Sometimes listen to music, sometimes smoke weed. 
Rarely anything else.
I don’t remember what I’m even thinking about half the time. But I spend hours doing it. Then I go to sleep and get up for work again.

I check in with my friends occasionally but I feel much more content when I don’t interact with anyone outside of work. I feel bad that they worry.
It’s not like I don’t love them, I just don’t have a desire to talk to anyone. I still care about them dearly.
I feel calm now. Often when I’m around other people, my emotions are hard to control or I feel crippling social anxiety. Even with close friends. So I avoid it now. I like being alone.

I’ve been prescribed adderall for ADHD because I lack focus and disassociate. But I don’t think it does anything more than give me energy to work. 

I don’t feel depressed. I kinda just don’t really feel anything.


tldr; No desire for friends, no hobbies, just work, sleep, and repeat.


Is living a lifestyle with no engagement healthy?
