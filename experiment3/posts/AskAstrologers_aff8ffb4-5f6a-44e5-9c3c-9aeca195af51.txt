Astrology and Abuse
I'm noticing a great influx of questions over the last couple days that ask: "Is this the chart of an abuser/narcissist/harmful person?" I'm wondering if these are questions that should even really be posed here at all. The threads of responses have often not been enlightening. I wonder what other astrologers think.

It makes sense that people are coming here for answers, especially around the holidays when contact with difficult family members is more likely. Externalizing how someone has hurt you by saying "It's their moon in Aries" or "They're cheaters because of their Mars in Sagittarius" is a really common way to use astrology today, but I don't think it is helpful or useful. How someone harms is of course present in the natal chart, but it's present in everyone's chart--all humans have the capacity to harm. There is no aspect for abuse. There are only abusive actions. It seems a disservice to pretend otherwise, even if a person is begging for astrology to be the answer. 

Here are some books that may be of use to everyone. They have certainly helped me:
