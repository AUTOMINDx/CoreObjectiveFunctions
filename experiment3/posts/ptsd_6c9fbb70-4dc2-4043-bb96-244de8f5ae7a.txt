My depression becomes more severe whenever I have brief moments of happiness...and I've started to hate those small glimpses of what could be
Because I always crash down so hard when reality kicks in that I'll never feel like I did before my trauma. I will never be truly happy again with this looming over me. Whenever I have those few moments of happiness, it further drives home the fact that I'm completely miserable on the inside. 

And I hate it. I hate it so much it hurts to breathe. It feels like my mind is trying to tell me that I don't deserve to be happy. And maybe I don't. 

I just wish the small spikes of serotonin would go away so that maybe I can start adapting to a new baseline. I'm so tired of feeling wrong and bad knowing that I'm missing out on feeling normal.
