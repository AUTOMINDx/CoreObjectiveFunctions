Anyone else have a bad sense of balance?
It doesn't affect me too much, but I've noticed that when my dp is worse it definitely messes with my balance. I notice it especially at grocery stores. As I'm walking I struggle to stay balanced/feel like I'm walking on stilts and find myself holding onto the cart for stability. 

People at work joke that I'm always high (・_・;)
