what are Moral Arguments for and against authoritarian socialist states and Marxist-Leninist advocates of communism?
Hello there!

I wonder what philosophers generally think about the course of states like China or the UdSSR, I ended up in a debate with a tankie recently, it seemed to go in the direction of discrediting every argument for being "western centric", i.e. he framed it in a way that I was unable to make an argument because I held some premises alien to her. I wonder how this debate goes for professional philosophers. ML- or Authoritarian communist systems seem incompatible with several normative frameworks to me.
