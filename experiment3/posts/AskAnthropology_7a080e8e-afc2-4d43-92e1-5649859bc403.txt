How did primitive humans run naked?
Whenever I run a little around my house after a shower, my testicles sway a lot uncomfortably and even hit my legs causing pain. Women without a bra would also be uncomfortable to run as their breasts would bounce uncomfortably. How did primitive humans sprint at full speed without discomfort or pain? Were testicles and breasts just smaller or did they just bare through the discomfort and get used to it?
