My Merry Christmas gift to you
**I have lived and worked all over the world.** I have been married. I have two beautiful children who now have children of their own. I can not count the times my heart has been broken. I have always hated parties and crowds. And doubted myself. I have never taken prescribed drugs or labelled myself as being something. But I'm still here. I still believe my best creative ass kicking/difference is to come. No, I never carried a horse on my back for 15 miles on the way to school through the snow (old school esoteric reference). **But you have all found my heart this year and I count that as a huge WIN. Thank you so much! x**
