If more money in the hands of the poor will cause inflation, what's the money doing now?
so they say UBI (Universal basic income) will cause inflation, because more money will be in the hands of consumers, who will spend it on more goods.

more money chansing the same amount of goods = inflation

makes sense

so if we tax the rich more than we do now to implement UBI, what are the additional money that would be taxed do now?

before you say they invest it, isn't investing a form of spending too?

like, I invest into houses = I buy a company to build me a house

isn't that spending too?

help me understand this, please
