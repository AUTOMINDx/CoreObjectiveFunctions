I felt empathy for the first time yesterday AMA
It was the worst and most shocking thing ever. I was high though. 
Horrible, would not recommend. 

My friend is in debt $50k and I felt horrible for him, I genuinely felt sad, I almost wanted to pay it for him if I could afford it. 

This is the worst thing ever, I became self aware a while ago but only of my insecurities etc and I traveled to India and got REAL healing and hypnosis, I don’t know what the fuck happened but i want it to stop, I only wanted high self worth and real confidence

My defense mechanisms doesn’t work as before
