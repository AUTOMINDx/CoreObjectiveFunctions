My coming out story
I’ve been closeted for about 2 to 3 years now, and it’s been a bit confusing. Me and my best friend Jake (of 12 years) have been through a lot with each other in the past. We’re both in high school. We do practically everything together (like two best friends would). He came out to me as gay a couple months back. I was a bit shocked but nevertheless very supportive. I had asked him out of curiosity if he had ever liked me and he said the he’d had a crush on me since the 5th grade. I was somewhat scared this information would ruin our friendship, but it actually helped me come out to Jake. His expression was a bit confused. As both of us had crushes on one another, Jake leaned in and kissed me. I didn’t resist at all. It felt really nice and one thing led to another… and were in the his bed. But if anyone has some good boyfriend advice please share :)
