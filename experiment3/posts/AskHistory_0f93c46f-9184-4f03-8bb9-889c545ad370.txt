How much of British opposition to Nazi Germany was a genuine rejection of their beliefs and not British powers threatened by a new empire taking their colonies and power?
The British were really awful around the turn of the 20th century. Especially how they treated their colonies looking for independence and losing the grip on their powerful empire. They really tried to hold onto every inch of their empire with extreme violence, bloodshed and racist ideologies. The perception of Britain joining the war to do good in the world and fight for freedom when they were incredibly racist and cruel themselves doesnâ€™t add for me? There was a lot of sympathy towards fascism in the upper echelons of British society. A lot of Nazi beliefs overlap in terms of how real world British colonialism worked? Is the bravery of the British war effort a revisionist excercise in making Britain look good post war? Were they more so concerned with Germany taking their place in the world and that is the real reason they entered world war 2?
