TW/SA My boyfriend raped me, we talked it through already but I feel traumatized.
my boyfriend had been sexually assaulting me and raped me, but i didn’t realize what was really happening. when i did, i talked it through w/ him. he said sorry, won’t do it again &amp; cried. so we’re moving on. but i feel it hurt me a lot, emotionally. i feel like my body isn’t mine, it’s dirty, i want to take it off. i cry often now, thinking abt the rape all the time. i’m so hurt. what do i do? i still love him
