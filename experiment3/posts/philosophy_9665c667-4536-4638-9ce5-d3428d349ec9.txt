Chen Zhi, 31, is a migrant worker who completed one of his “Ambitions” in August by translating Richard Poulter's Introduction to Heidegger. There is nothing worth saying about the achievement itself. In most times, philosophy was considered useless, and the book was not published, didn’t even get any attention. As for the translator as a migrant worker, nothing but adds to some of the fun facts of the story.

But there is something really intriguing about Chen Zhi. He works in a huge factory, often from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Earning four or five thousand yuan a month, which is barely enough money to eat. At one point, he was in charge of repairing machines in a camera factory, wearing a blue dust-free suit on duty. The whole person is covered, with only two eyes showing. Without a stool, he stands for a whole day. There are no windows. Time is displayed on the computer. Using mobile phones is impossible. Nothing can be brought in, only people can go in. If there is one characteristic of this life, it is repetition and emptiness.

Life in the workshop is strict, precise, and meticulous. The machines never rest, people can not rest. Although this took up most of his life, it was only an episode for his life because "the length of time does not equal the length of meaning".

According to a survey, there are 285 million migrant workers in 2020. They live on machines attached to factories, forming a strange world different from ours. They are in the city, but they are all in one. As for what this kind of life can mean, what ambition they might have, often we ignore or ignore.

Until Chen Zhi told me a long story about how he was looking for meaning and how he thought about philosophy in his tiny rental room.

In 2011, he worked in Beijing and lived in a six- or seven-square-meter basement rented in Tongzhou. There were no windows, it was wet and dark. He lived alone. All he had was a bed and a table. While reading, he used the bed as a chair. There is no toilet in the house, he has to go to the public toilet outside. The environment is bad, but there is nothing you can do about it. He bought an LCD tablet and read e-book in the basement, and it was during that time that he worked with the English translation to read Heidegger's Existence and Time.

Over the years, he had been to five places to work, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Beijing. Every time he went to a different city, he went to the local library to read. Philosophy, he often says, is his "passion" and "mission". He went to Beijing to work because the National Library is the largest library in China. He went to work at Foxconn in Shenzhen, and after his shift, he went to the neighborhood library next to Foxconn to read a book.

He seemed out of keeping with his social identity, and his family felt that he was not serious enough about his work and delusionally wanted to read philosophy books. He began to be more anxious, but there was nothing he could do, and in the end, he simply let go. ‘Friend’ of the word, he dare not use it easily. Because in the village, he was the one who’s on top of his studies, but now he is the most down-to-the-bottom person. He described himself as a "useless man".

He never forgot that he is a migrant worker. He is often discriminated against on the basis of his social status. In his early years, he went to the store to buy clothes, the staff did not serve him. Even for getting a haircut, the staff would not talk to him.

Philosophy can provide him with many words to describe his life. Heidegger's criticism of technology, he would think about it at the beginning of his career. But now he doesn’t think much of it, because he’s used to this life. He read Schopenhauer's book. “Life sways between pain and boredom.” But he doesn’t feel bored, on the contrary, life is full of profound meanings to understand.

Here's his autobiography: (Later Chen Zhi commented under the article saying it’s not autobiography but paraphrase by the reporter. He claimed that if it is, it would be different word-choices)

# In the workshop

I was working in a factory in Xiamen when I translated Richard Poulter's Introduction to Heidegger.

I'm a migrant worker and I've been working since 2010. I only do short-term work since I can’t stand the long-term work. The longest work lasted about half a year. The last job took more than three months to do and I left, which was a long time compared to other jobs. I live now in Xiamen Jimei District, there are many factories and employment agencies here, generally are based on the intermediary introduction or labor dispatch. Short-term workers' wages are higher than those of regular workers, with hourly wages of more than 20 yuan, but the base salary of regular workers is very low, like Xiamen’s minimum wage. Some people can earn six thousand yuan a month, but they need to do 300 hours of work a month, an average of eleven or twelve hours a day.

The factory is a Chinese/Taiwanese company that makes mobile phone cameras and is a supplier to mobile phone factories such as Apple and Xiaomi. Many of the names here adapt the Taiwanese word use, for example, they will translate software into “soft body”, which always makes me think of mollusks, I also quite resist these words.

The factory has different production lines, a bit of glue machine, as well as the assembly camera set up machine. I was on the maintenance team. The machine is the size of a small wardrobe, seven or eight workers are responsible for repairing machines online, I managed ten machines alone. Machines are equipped with various mechanisms to prevent injury, such as infrared as if called gratings. If your hand is blocking the infrared, the machine will stop.

Repairing the machine is about the same as repairing a car, but the machine is smaller. The machine stands on the ground. So I had to squat down. It cannot be moved, otherwise, the accuracy will be affected. Machines don’t break often. If they do, a specific group of people will ask me to repair it. Standing there every day will take more time than the process of repairing. The workshop has a constant temperature, always twenty-five or six degrees. The boss is not worried about us, but about machines and products.

There are no windows, time is only displayed on the computer. The company computer can access the company's website, the computer is terrible, I will not use it to surf on the Internet, I’ll be blind staring at that screen. I do not want to use that display for a second. Without a stool to sit on, we stand all day. It is impossible to use mobile phones, it is impossible to bring it in. Nothing can be brought in, only people get in.

I also had to wear a blue dust-free suit on the job, the camera can not have dust or particles. The whole body is covered with only two eyes showing. Different types of work have different colors of clothing. We are at the bottom. The manager, team leader, section chief, if these people want to come in, they also have to wear the same dust-free clothes, but they generally do not come in.

There is nothing to think about in the factory, if I need to repair the machine, I repair the machine. If someone talks to me, I speak. If no one talks, I zone out. But it is impossible to think of Heidegger. The noise there is too disturbing, it’s very boring.

Other machine repair workers are all men, they generally talk about women and games. I just listen. I do not take the initiative to offend them, but also do not interject. But when they talk about prostitution, I walk away.

I often feel that everything is meaningless as if it doesn't make any sense. A few years ago, I would write a diary in English, every day was filled with words like “upset, desperate, dismayed”. At the beginning of this year, I was particularly disappointed in myself. Maybe it was some pointless moment that made me think about my existence. I usually like to read philosophy books. Heidegger said that he had only one problem in his life which is existence. "Why are there beings at all instead of nothing?” I think that's probably the most important issue as well. I wanted to be able to write something out on the basis of thinking and implement some of my own “Ambition”, so I started trying to translate.

In fact, translation is not as difficult as you think. About ten years ago, I struggled to read some Chinese translations of philosophy books. Philosophical terms, when translated into another language, tend to become blunt. When I first realized that I needed to read the original, I began to learn English. I use a dictionary to recite words, directly from the most difficult level, GRE, TOEFL, etc. After two years of study, I can read the original English. When I translate, I look up the dictionary, if I don’t understand. There is no difficulty. The real difficulty is that there is no time.

For example, in this factory, to rest is to take leave. if you don’t take leave, there is no day off for the entire month. Many people choose not to rest for even a day in order to earn more overtime money. Because I want to translate "Heidegger Introduction", generally I would take one day off a week. I also can not ask for more leave. Two days a week will not be approved. Taking leave means there will be no overtime money at all which can be two or three hundred dollars a day. Our base salary is only 1800 yuan, which is the minimum wage set by Xiamen. Wages are mainly based on overtime money, those who do not take a day off a month have more than 6000 yuan. If you work more than 8 hours a day, it counts as overtime.

My reason for taking leave is always something comes up or I’m sick. I'm not going to tell them that I translate. No one in the whole factory knows that I read philosophy nor translate philosophy. I'm always by myself. I don't talk about it. I never tell anyone what I'm doing.

After work, everything I do at home is prioritized. The most important thing is to read, and I recently read John Richardson’s (an American Heidegger scholar) Heidegger. If I can't read it, I'll translate it like “Seeking Authenticity: From Kirkegol to Camus”. If I don’t want to translate, if I want to do nothing, I check Douban and Zhihu. (Douban is a social media platform like letterbox for books and movies, Zhihu is like Quora) I do not use Weibo. (Chinese Twitter) The first two years I logged it out and deleted my Weibo. The information there was too shallow. People on Douban, seems to me, might be less mediocre.

I also worked for Foxconn in Shenzhen, where I was responsible for assembling the iPad's screen from May until the end of July. First of all, you need to test, from the detection machine to see whether the brightness of the screen is uneven if there are no bright spots. Bad products will be disposed of. The job there is to sit down every day. It’s more tiring than making a cell phone camera. The machine will calculate the time, the fastest speed is about a person to install 800 screens a day, 30 seconds to paste a screen. At that time, there is nothing in your head. Because it is a pipeline, you have to do it very quickly. Once distracted, you can not do well. Slow speed, if found by the line leader, will be scolded. There, the sense of emptiness is a small matter. It is just too tiring, especially for the night shift, it’s even more difficult. If your eyes are shutting down, wash your face with cold water or stand up and continue to do it.

In Foxconn's working days, the labor dispatch company agents rent rooms for us. The temporary workers, three or four hundred yuan a month, with water and electricity. Ten people lived in a dormitory. The room was compact with five bunk beds, plus a small private bathroom, and there was no table or chair. The agent does not allow the use of high-power electrical appliances, so even the kettle can not be used. You can only charge your mobile phone. Summer in Shenzhen is hot. Fortunately, the air conditioning is on 24 hours. Since roommates are randomly assigned, we were all from different departments and workshops. Some people on the night shift, some people on the day shift, our work time was all different. As a result, there are few quiet times in the room.

After work, I would take the ebook reader to casually find a place to read. Roadsides are OK, anywhere except in the dormitory, since I am quite sensitive to the crowd. Outside of the North Gate of Foxconn is the Qinghu labor library, some people who work nearby would be there to read, I also love to go there to read.

Translation work is only possible over weekends. One day off per week, I would go to Longhua Culture and Arts Center to translate books. Back then I made my translation urgent. I would translate from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m until the closure. One day I could translate about 3,000 words. But when it came to both translating and reading, my progress would be slower, only a thousand words. So the two hundred-page Introduction of Heidegger took me on and off four months to translate.

I felt as if the entire underclass is almost all this tiring. It’s a feeling I can't describe, beyond my ability, maybe someone else can describe it truly, but I lack the ability to truly describe it. That's always been the case, and you know, philosophy is about very obscure abstract concepts. I couldn't write from an early age.

Heidegger's criticism of technology, I thought about it at the beginning of my career. But now I don't think much of it, because I'm used to it. Well, there's nothing you can do, is there?

# The misfit

I had some college education, but I dropped out.

It was 2008, a so-called second-tier college. The major is mathematics. I was looking for the most essential thing. Mathematically, for example, I want to know what the nature of natural numbers is. I'm curious to think about what the nature of our consciousness is, and what the nature of our vision is. So later I felt that college classes, such as mathematical analysis, often differential, analysis of geometry, such as this, could not solve my problem. I could only read books on my own, to think on my own. Back then I would mainly read Kant and Hegel which brought me a lot of understandings of the phenomenon, even the understanding of the essence. Hegel's philosophy, in particular, his so-called absolute spirit, is to describe the entire history of mankind, the whole world, the entire universe.

'Reason is the law of the universe, ' Hegel said. That one sentence of his. I felt like all the problems can be solved. But that's just the view at that time, it's different now, and now I think it's wrong.

In the end, I was so obsessed with philosophy that I completely forgot my major. At the beginning of my sophomore year, I didn't go to any of the classes. The credit system is too complex which I do not understand. Every day I would be in the library, reading. I also didn’t go to exams. The school told me to drop out, and I agreed immediately.

In real life, I might have social pressure. I talked to a counselor for the first time when I need him to sign the drop-out form. When I was a child, I was subjected to much domestic violence. Such people often are more cowardly, cautious, generally do not take the initiative to speak. So in college, I was on the edge. Living in a four-person dormitory, only one roommate would talk to me, and they, like everyone else, loved to talk about women. But I wasn’t lonely, reading philosophy books let me temporarily forget the reality. It's not an escape, it's not why I read philosophy. I read philosophy mainly problem-oriented. I have some problems that I hope to solve. It's definitely not about running away from anything, it's not like that.

At that time the idea was very simple, I think it is better to drop out than to go to school. The school has no philosophy department at all, if I drop out of school I can go home to study. But I did not expect, when my family heard that I dropped out of school, they did not let me go home. Philosophy doesn’t make sense to them. I grew up in rural Jiangxi. Parents are farmers. In their concept, if you do not go to school, you can only go to work. Even they don't know what it's like to look for a job, I, thus, have no career plan.

I never thought about the future and work, and it doesn't matter to me. Heidegger said that people are thrown into this world. I also did not think about re-entering the university, the family is financially difficult, my father would not let me. And I thought I didn't have to deal with people at work. Then I found out that I was wrong. When there is people, there is politics.

My mother used to say that you would regret it in your thirties.

Now, I think, this saying has been partially verified. I did have a hard time, from dropping out till now, it has been my low point of life. I have never reached a peak. If I went back to the moment I dropped out, I might have made a different choice, but given my circumstances and status, I probably wouldn't have. I didn't think about it at the time.

My first job, is in a township garment factory in Zhejiang sewing machine when the intermediary from Hangzhou conned me to go to Zhuji, did a month there, not much wage, only 500 yuan. Sewing machine for me is very difficult, need to keep pedaling, once working on a down jacket, I did not do well, the down was out, I was scolded. I felt like I couldn’t do it, some people, who went there with me, seem to be able to learn easily, but I could not.

For the second job, I went to a factory to make instant noodles barrels, also through the employment center intermediary to find, in the words of the present, they are human resource team. That job was also based on machines, I use the machine to roll that kind of paper, roll it and get it done. Very mechanical, but also tiring. Once, when I was on the line, I took a call and was fired. At that time, the factory is not short of people, they could recruit people at any time. As long as you do not obey, they would tell you to get out of the way.

One of the most tiring jobs I've ever done was moving goods in Wuxi in 2018. Did more than two months, 12 hours a day, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., they had all sorts of goods, large bottles of water, drinks, and rice, because there were many supermarket orders. There was a team leader monitoring us, so not allowed to rest. After one day, it is really tiring, the sort of tiredness one can not express verbally.

Working these years, I live in the dormitory. Roommates never talk to each other. Their names I do not know. Because the work is too tiring, people come and go. The turnover rate is very high. During those eleven years, I may become a little closer to the two workers, but I changed the mobile phone number several times, and now there is no contact information.

Those two people are my former friends. Seven or eight years ago, I didn't even have the money to eat, so I borrowed 100 yuan from him. I thought I couldn't borrow it, I didn't think he would actually lend it to me. I thought he was a very nice person. The other one talks to me more, some trivial things. I never talk to anyone about philosophy.

I have been to five places to work, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Beijing, and every time I go to a city I go to the local library to read. In 2011, I ran from the south to Beijing to work, because the National Library is the largest library in China, I want to go there to read more books. I spent four hundred dollars and rented a basement of six or seven square meters in Tongzhou. The basement has no windows, is very damp, very dark, I lived alone, all I had was a bed and a table, reading when the bed was a chair. There is no toilet in the house, and you have to go to the public toilet outside. The environment is bad, but there is nothing you can do about it.

From Tongzhou to the national library is relatively far, takes an hour and a half on the subway, so I bought an LCD flat screen, more often I just read e-books in the basement. My vision got worse because of the amount of e-book reading.

# Philosophy is My Passion

Philosophy is my passion, it's the commitment. In Chinese, it is "passion" and "sense of mission". Maybe the sense of mission is too strong, but it's okay to translate it as "commitment, promise," but "commitment, promise" is too weak. I posted on Douban Group, “Mission as the Meaning of Life”. When I feel meaningless, I go to those such as Xuanxuan, Zhang Yitang, Chen Jingrun to motivate themselves, because even people like the Beijing University math genius Zhang Yitang, there was a period of time for him not to do mathematics. This helps me out of the sense of meaninglessness.

Most of the time, my obsession with philosophy makes me forget the malevolence of the outside world, but life is a constant reminder of my social identity as a "migrant worker".

It can be said that childhood had a decisive influence on my character. I grew up in domestic violence, with fist-and-kick violence and emotional abuse for no reason. Father always does this to me, as long as he is in a bad mood, taking a bath, watching a TV, he will scold you. He is not tall, but as long as he has a gloomy face, I am instinctively afraid of him. I didn't dare to scold him back until I was in my twenties. My feelings for him are not complicated, that is, there is no feeling, we have basically broken off the relationship.

I often think that if I hadn't been subjected to so much domestic violence, it would have been different now. Oppression from the family probably ends around the age of 20, but that doesn't mean you won't be oppressed after the age of 20. To tell you the truth, I am now also very oppressed, such as not making money, not understanding philosophy, can not make friends. I have become more and more introverted and even began to get a little chin-up when I spoke.

In previous years, I've tried to change my so-called introverted personality and want to be the kind of person who can deal with people. But it's hard, I never talk to people about philosophy, it's so different among migrant workers that people might laugh at me, so I'd rather hide it. Later now, I still feel that the status quo should be maintained, it can not be changed.

But I'm not lonely, I never feel lonely. Oppression is the norm in life, but that doesn't mean loneliness is unbearable to me.

I used to read Schopenhauer, and he said that “life sways between pain and boredom”, and that his pessimism may not mean much philosophically. I don't get bored - at least for the most part, life is full of profound meanings that need to be understood, and life in the workshop is just an episode, and these things aren't worth mentioning. The length of time is not equal to the length of meaning.

Among the ten years of working life, Satre, Kierkegaard, Husser, Deleuze, and Levi Strauss of Anthropology, I read all. Until 2017, I experienced the deepest and most powerless despair in philosophy. At that time, I would like to write a few philosophical papers to publish, the title has been drawn up, but I could not write.

Writing papers requires a lot of sources and literature reviews, and I feel like I don't have the ability. First, I don't have that many books, and second, these things are not very easy to find. And at that time my philosophy level is relatively rudimentary, still working at factories, not so much time to do these.

The longest piece I wrote has a few hundred words. Looking at the empty computer screen, I could write no more. After all these years of self-study, I found that I might not be able to do philosophy, it’s too frustrating. I worked at a hardware factory in Shantou, on April 1, 2017, I wrote in my diary: I'm done at all. I can't beat anyone else, and if I get the chance, I'll translate some foreign books. Philosophy itself I can not do, I must give up!

I was very anxious during that time because I heard my mother saying that a woman I knew made millions, and I didn't even save a few thousand yuan. My mother, seeing me being not serious about working, but delusionally trying to read some philosophy books, would use this example to stimulate me. Because I don't make money, she also got contempt, ridicule, and even insult from her neighbors.

Within society, I have suffered a lot of discrimination because of the status of migrant workers. Earlier days when I went to clothes shop, the staff did not serve me. Even when I went for a haircut, the shop assistant would not talk to me.

All my WeChat friends are people I knew before I was 18, and I've hardly met anyone new in the years. The word “friend”, I dare not use easily. Somebody like me, first, can not make money, no house, no car, second, not married until in middle age. They always thought I couldn't get a wife.

In May 2021, I wrote a self-confession on the Internet, “from the person who’s top of his studies to the most down-to-the-bottom..." For primary and middle school, I am generally the first or the first few, also sent by the teacher to participate in the county math competition. I got first place in the middle school placement exam. For the rural villages, I was "the most studious person.” But now, people I knew from childhood are doing all kinds of business, architecture, building houses, or opening a shop, and I was the least likely one to make money among all of them.

The later half of last year, a friend of the past suddenly came to Guangdong to talk to me, he opened a shop, we chatted. At that time, I casually made a joke, probably like I’m the least achieved, everyone looked down on me.

Having said that, I waited for his response, but he said nothing. He acquiesced.

I think most "mortals" are happy to see me like this. This is also human nature, see others down, bad, they themselves get satisfied. In “The Criminal Lu Yanshi”, Lu Yanshi was described by his aunt as a "useless person", and I also felt that I am a useless person, like a waste.

I was so broken by the philosophy that for a long time I didn't touch it.

# Three Stages of the Path of Life

I study philosophy without any so-called realistic purpose, absolutely not, if any, it would be a kind of woe. But I don't think philosophy is useless. Philosophy can change the existence of man, or at least his understanding of the world. It's not a generic change, it's a fundamental change.

When I first entered the workshop, I often thought of the three stages of the path of life that Kierkegaard said. The first stage is the aesthetic, which is to rely on the senses to live, make money to eat, drink and play, with no other purpose. Kierkegaard says such people are essentially the most desperate, though they don't think they are. This is true of many of my workmates around me. They talk about women, prostitution, and life revolves around these biological instincts.

The second stage is that ethics, that is, people who abide by social ethics, probably most people are like this. The third stage is that religion, only beyond the social moral concept or ethical concept, beyond the universal people, can live such a life. At one point I wished I could go beyond secular society to become a so-called single individual, but despite my reluctance, I accepted the marriage, had children, and became a second-stage ordinary person.

My wife comes from the same county, 3 years younger than me. We met in early 2020, soon married. The outbreak was so severe in February that the wedding didn’t happen until the end of last year. Rural wedding is very simple. We did not invite any bridesmaids or any other rituals. In the yard, we set up 10 or 20 tables, killed a chicken, went to the temple to worship the ancestors, then the wedding was over.

I've forgotten the exact date of the wedding, it seems like someday in December. After all, I did not plan it myself, it’s only normal that I don’t remember. It wasn't long before my son was born, my wife was delivered by cesarean section, and my mother and I were with her for the entire time. I don't really feel much about the birth of a child, it may be heartless to say, but he was born on which specific day, I really can't remember.

My wife went to technical secondary school. Her salary is higher than mine because she works more overtime. She doesn’t take a leave for weekends, not one day per month. I tell her to rest, she is not willing. Just to earn two or three hundred dollars more for overtime. She wears a red dust-free suit at the factory, checking the lens, and whether the camera has stains. We go together for work, work in different workshops, and then come back together in the evening. She's on the night shift now, starting at 8:30 p.m, she comes back around nine o'clock in the morning. She sleeps during the day.

Usually, I talk to my wife about what I really think. I can express myself more frankly and truthfully in front of her. It's just that I don't know if there are any real feelings between us, I don't know what it means. Usually, in addition to the daily trivial things, there is no common topic.

My wife doesn't really understand what I think, she can't understand philosophy, she can't understand Heidegger. I tried to talk about it shortly after I got married, but she wasn't interested and told me not to. She likes to use her phone after work, wears headphones, and watches TikTok. I read. We do not disturb each other.

This year, the sense of meaninglessness that has bred from disappointment has guided me to pick up Heidegger again. I translated Richard Poulter's Introduction to Heidegger and wanted to find a publisher to publish it. I wrote to some publishers on Douban and asked the editor if they could publish them, and they didn't reply to me. I held a simple thought. Such academic books are very difficult to publish since they are hard to sell. So I don't know what to do. I feel very powerless.

I longed to be able to go back to college. Although I had dropped out of school before, at that time, I did not expect this is what it’s like in society, especially in the underclass. Whether it is studying mathematics or philosophy, I still have to face some of the most basic survival issues. Now, through work, I earn four or five thousand a month, which can only support me to eat.

Recently I left the factory, and I couldn't find a job momentarily, so I go to The Xiamen Library to read and stay there until 8 p.m. But in the end, I have to work. On the assembly line, one by one, a product at a time. From 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., 12 hours, lunch for an hour. It's a night shift every other month. Keep doing it, let the machine never rest, people will never rest.
