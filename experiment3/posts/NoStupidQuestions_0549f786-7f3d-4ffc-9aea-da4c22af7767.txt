"If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" Why is that considered a philosophical question when it seems to have a straightforward answer?
If a tree falls in the forest, it creates sound waves which pass through the air regardless of whether someone hears it or not. Someone doesn't need to hear or see something happen for it to have happened. Am I just thinking about this too simplistically or what?
