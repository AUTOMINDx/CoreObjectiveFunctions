Got punched in the stomach, having severe pain hours later
(F27 170cm 58kg)
Got punched in the stomach earlier today and i am in so much pain right now, i'm tired and i feel like i'm gonna pass out from the pain.
The pain is so much worse now then it was 10hrs ago, it feels like it's getting worse and worse.. it's so bad i can't sleep and i can't stop crying, it feels like someone blew a hole in my stomach, and throught those 10 hours i've been feeling dizzy and like i'm about to throw up any second but never actually being able to do it.
Should i do something about it right now? What's the worst thing that can happen if i just try my best to ignore it?
I'm really considering going to a hospital right this instant. Please help.
