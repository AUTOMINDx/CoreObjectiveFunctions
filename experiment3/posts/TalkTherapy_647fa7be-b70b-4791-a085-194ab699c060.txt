My therapist is my imaginary friend
So, my therapist is a real person, but I do not meet with her that often. I have extreme social anxiety, depression, and loneliness, so when I finally met with this therapist, it’s like I finally found someone to talk to about my anxiety and neglectful parents. 
Outside of therapy, when I feel like I need someone to talk to, I talk to her in my head, and in a way, she responds as an imaginary friend would. I’m also a maladaptive daydreamer, so she shows up frequently in my daydreams when I need someone to talk to, and it’s just as if we are in an actual session. 

Anyone else here do something like this. I want to tell my therapist, because she isn’t my first “imaginary friend”, however, I don’t want her to be creeped out lol. Should I just tell her about my previous “imaginary friends”, and keep the one that’s her to myself? She frequently asks me how I cope with loneliness, and this has been a major way I’ve been coping, but I’ve also been keeping it from her, because I’m a little embarrassed
