I pulled myself out of a negativity/self-criticism spiral today.
I kinda hated doing it.

It's very hard. It's extremely uncomfortable trying to console my mind and show myself self-compassion when I've been used to getting the opposite my whole life. All of it is just... weird.

I've been in bed all day, completely depressed. Like, "What's the point of anything?" kind-of thinking.

At some point, I told myself many things that felt uncomfortable.

"You're in a bad spot mentally right now"

"You feel unloved and like you can't do anything. It's understandable you feel that way based on your experiences"

"The way they treated you says nothing about you and everything about them. You were a child"

"Many people have treated you with kindness just fine, regardless of your flaws"

"You missed out on having a life for a long time, so it's understandable you're feeling left out"

All of it felt uncomfortable. It definitely feels incredibly lonely. Kinda wish it wasn't so hard, or that I wasn't so terribly sabotaged by my my family.

I'm honestly not sure what else to say. I'd like to be more positive and forgiving to myself, but it's very uncomfortable!
