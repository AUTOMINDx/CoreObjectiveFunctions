Do u think that small boobs are attractive and sexy?
I'm 20y and hate my boobs, they're small and it makes me feel REALLY insecure. 
I grew up listening guys talking about big boobs, watching on TV, and stuff like that.
I feel like i'm not sexy enough because of this, and i need a opinion 
(Pls be honest, but don't be mean)

Edit: thanks a lot for everyone who replied, I'll try to read as many comments as I can :)
