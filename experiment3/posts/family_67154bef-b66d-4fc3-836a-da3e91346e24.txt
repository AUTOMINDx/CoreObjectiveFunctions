is it strange for a 16 year old daughter to seek out comfort by sleeping next to her father?
slept over at my uncle’s house yesterday. was catching up until late  and ended up sleeping on futon in younger cousin’s room. apparently she had a really bad nightmare that night and so when i went to the bathroom the next morning i saw her  and her dad sharing the sofa bed. (it’s a small apartment so he gave her the only room while he sleeps in their living room). it didn’t look bad at all, it was actually very pure. but it got me thinking what age society would consider this type of thing no longer acceptable.
