[OR] Hourly to Salary, But for Devious Reasons
Good day,

I read the top pinned post about 7 things your employer can change. So now I'm confused. So my employer changed my status from Hourly to Salary but because overtime costs them money. The odd thing however is if I hadn't worked overtime during quarterly payroll filing, we would have probably incurred fees and penalties. My manager has made multiple remarks to try to illustrate that working for low pay was the way things typically went. He has told me countless times that he worked for a lot less growing up. It feels like an odd manipulative tactic. I could be wrong. 


So after the switch I started working exactly 8 hrs and nothing more. This has caused a riff at work. He tries to say bye to me now not because it's courteous but as a way to guilt me despite completing all my tasks. Before I wouldn't have to say bye to him. 

Also starting to feel distant from my coworkers. The working dynamics is strange. They are all friends of the owners kids or friends of the manager. This has caused me not to talk as much as I use to because I'm concerned if I ever say anything it's more likely to get back to the manager. Even if they weren't so close they could still tell the manager anything I say. I'm an anxious person.

So my question is. How should I handle this. January is coming up and that's usually our busiest due to w2 needing to be sent out, quarterly and annual tax filing and payments. Because I'm not looking to take a pay cut (working overtime on exempt status is a nope from me) I'm looking to talk to the manager and tell him what I plan on doing. Either that or quitting and going elsewhere. Is this a good way to handle things?
