How do you deal with rage/sadness from patriarchal trauma?
I'm 22F. I come from a traditional South Asian Muslim residence. Within the past year, I discovered radical feminism &amp; realized the ways in which misogyny permeates all facets of my life. It's filled me with rage and anger. My family has done very horrible things to me, ie abuse, patriarchal threats. How do you all deal with the rage? The depression?
