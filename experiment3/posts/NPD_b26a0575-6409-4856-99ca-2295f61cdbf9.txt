I never see my faults.
I journal a lot, all the time. I'll destroy someone, I'll be distasteful &amp; go to war with them and aim out to crush them completely, but at the time this occurs, in my eyes, they are completely irrational, at fault &amp; I am the victim, they deserve the suffering I cause.

A few months later, I look back at my journal entries &amp; I remember the encounters &amp; situations. As a third-person reading my old entries, as future me who barely remembers what had occurred, how I felt, etc. it always seems to me, that I was the dysfunctional one.

At the time I just don't see it, I get into conflict, but they always seem to be at fault. A few months later, self-reflection occurs &amp; I realize I was the problem. How &amp; why was I so cruel? How could I not see it?

I physically &amp; literally am incapable of seeing my mistakes. I can, but by the time I do, it's too late. At the moment it's "How dare you, you pathetic scum" after I detach from the situation &amp; time has passed, "Yeah, I was wrong, I was the asshole.".

But I do not see it...
