Don’t reach out! Don’t do it!
I don’t know who needs to hear this but don’t reach out to that person just because it’s the holidays. You will regret it come January. Don’t send the Xmas card, don’t send the text, don’t call. Don’t give them the spark they need to start a fire. A calm holiday is priceless, even if it’s not a happy holiday. ❤️
