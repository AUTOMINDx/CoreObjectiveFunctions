What does recovery for a narcissist look like? My therapists response
So today I asked my therapist what recovery looks like for me. At what point do I know that I am recovered?

He explained to me that pathological narcissism is all about using maladaptive methods to regulate self esteem. Recovery happens when your self esteem is being regulated adaptively, when you feel happy, fulfilled, and content in life, and no longer act on urges that cause harm to other people or yourself.

I asked him if my urges to manipulate or hurt people will go away once I’m recovered. He told me that the urges will be much less frequent, and that I won’t feel a strong need to act on them.

I asked him if once I’m recovered, if my brain will be the same as someone who doesn’t have narcissism. He told me that everyone has some degree of narcissism, it’s just that when it leads us to maladaptive behaviours, that’s when it becomes a problem. He told me that a recovered narcissist that has good behavioural regulation, is more healthy than a non-narcissist with bad behavioural regulation.

Everybody has urges that are not adaptive. Narcissists and non-narcissists. What matters is that we are not falling victim to these urges.

We can recover. We can change. I have faith in all of us.
