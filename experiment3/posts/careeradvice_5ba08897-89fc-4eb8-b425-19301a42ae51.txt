Appropriate to ask my boss about their retirement timeline?
My boss is 69yo and keeps joking about retirement. They also say things like “this will all be your responsibility when I retire”. They have 30yo experience while I’m about 2.5y.

Naturally I’m excited and nervous if I have to fill their shoes. Would there be any classy way to bring this up in conversation? I’m kind of curious what the timeline is and how/if the transition would happen?
