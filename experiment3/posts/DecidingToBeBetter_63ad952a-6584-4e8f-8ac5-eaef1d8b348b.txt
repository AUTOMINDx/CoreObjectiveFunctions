Being too self-aware can also F you up to a certain extent.
I was a very toxic person before and after realizing my toxic traits, I worked on myself and changed for the better. Though what I've noticed is that I became too self-aware and too conscious about everything: my actions, words, emotions, etc to the point that it also became self-destructive. It turned out to be me being scared to speak up because I mostly get reprimanded/get into drama for doing so, or overanalyzing other people's actions towards me. 

I'm in the middle of trying to be better, but it seems like I'm on the other end of the spectrum which is as destructive as the person I was before. I don't know how to deal with this because after all, I'm still a people-pleaser.
