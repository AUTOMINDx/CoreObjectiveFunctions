Fell off a ladder and hit my head on the table in the process, i feel like i'm gonna die
F31 165cm 56kg 
4hours ago, was painting the ceiling and slipped and fell off the ladder,i feel backwards hitting my head on the hard wood desk right at the edge of it.
I passed out for a few seconds and when i first stood up upon waking up i felt some weird tingling at the back of my head along with extreme sharp pain that i couldn't even pin point where it was coming from, it hurts everywhere, i feel like i can't get out of my bed now.
I threw up not too long after, during those4 hrs ifelt like i had to throw up all the time and then i threw up again 2 hours after that, m! Hheadache is worse now, my legs feel week/shaky and ifeel tingling in them.
I am very tired, so tired that i have to widen my eyes every couple of seconds as to nz fall asleep
I'm terrified, i feel like i'm dying, i'm home all alone so noone can drive me to a hospital, i wanna call the ambulance but the hosspital bill scares me, i also have an irrational fear of hospitals.
And all i've been doing is searchig up symptoms on google for the past 3 hours now, i'm really scared.

If i don't feel better in 2 hours i'm calling an ambulance, at this point i feel like i don't have a choice.
