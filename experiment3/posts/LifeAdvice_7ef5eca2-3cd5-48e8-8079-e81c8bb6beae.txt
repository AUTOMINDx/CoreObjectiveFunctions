Jack of all trades and master of none better than being a jack of many trades and master of maybe one?
'An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field'

Neils Bohr. 

This is a repeatedly used statement and widely encouraged as well. But I think I beg to differ. 

I dislike narrow fields of work. I think you can be a holistic problem solver if you worked on a larger plane. Ofcourse you can always dive deeper into something you like.

But the way jobs are designed where one human does that one tiny job is very upsetting. 

I mean I may be wrong. But help me see why.
