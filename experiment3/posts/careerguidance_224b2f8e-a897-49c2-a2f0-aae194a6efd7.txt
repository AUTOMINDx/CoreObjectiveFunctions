Should I become an Engineer or Scientist?
Well, business and medicine is a no no for me. I hate biology and I don't want to become am businessman because of some horrors. My favorite subjects are physics and math(which I have studied) and can cope up with chemistry well enough. The real question is which job pays the highest? I want to become a streamer but I want a Plan B as well so....
