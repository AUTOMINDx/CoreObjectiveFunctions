Rascist Karen Runs Away From Black People
So this happened when I was 10 years old, I was at the dollar store with my mother and we got our stuff and then we got in line. The person in front of us said to me and my mother “if you don’t move back I will have a panic attack right now” and then we moved back without saying anything but we couldn’t move far enough because the dollar store was quite small and there was a fair amount of people behind us. She decides to push us back along with the person behind us and say
“keep your black fingers away from me!” So then when she pays she throws the money at the *indian* cashier and sprints out of there.

Just realised after editing the title says rascist not racist doesn’t allow me to change the title so just read it as racist
