If the body can naturally dissolve blood clots formed in blood vessels on their own, how some people still suffer from DVT?
I heard the body is able to dissolve blood clots on their own, if thats possible then why do people still have long lasting blood clots/DVT? Cant the body just naturally get rid of if?

Update: Thank you so much to everyone for answering this question, very much appreciated!
