Jobs where I can just work on a set task, preferably able to listen to music?
I know this is kind of broad but I just want something where I can work mostly independently get my shit done and go. I'm not really good with people and being able to work on detailed tasks helps my anxiety and focus. not really picky with what it is, just looking for suggestions because I'm drawing a blank right now
