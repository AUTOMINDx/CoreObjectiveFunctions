I feel my direct manager is afraid of me [NC]
I was recently hired as a Finance Manager in the large Finance Department of a multinational corporation [NC] 

I had to relocate cross country for this new position. 

There are multiple ranks above me. I was hired as a mid-level manager. 

My direct manager is a younger guy who lacks the technical experience. 
I am far more senior that my direct manager. 

It's been a few weeks that I'm in the job. 
It's very clear to me that my direct manager takes credit for my work. 
He seems to be afraid of me, and he doesn't expose me with the fear of looking bad. 
This morning for example, he took full credit for a report that I had written. I was so hurt. 

It's very hard. I'm feeling sidelined and I feel like a threat to my direct manager. I wish he could expose me, instead of keeping me on the sideline. 

Please advise me on what to do....
