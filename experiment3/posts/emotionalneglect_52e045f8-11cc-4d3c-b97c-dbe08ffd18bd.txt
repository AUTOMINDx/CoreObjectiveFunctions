Do you experience limerence? If you do how often? To what extent?
If you don't know what is limerence it's explained in this video. 
[great video about limerence](https://youtu.be/ga4VHjKkv70)

Also I found this explanation

Frequent intrusive thoughts about the limerent object (LO), who is a potential sexual partner.

An acute need for reciprocation of equally strong feeling.

Exaggerated dependency of mood on LO’s actions: elation when sensing reciprocation, devastation when sensing disinterest.

Inability to react limerently to more than one person at a time.

Fleeting relief from unrequited feeling through vivid fantasy about reciprocation by the LO.

Insecurity or shyness when in the presence of the LO, often manifesting in overt physical discomfort (sweating, stammering, racing heart).

Intensification of feelings by adversity.

An aching sensation in “the heart” when uncertainty is strong..

A general intensity of feeling that leaves other. concerns in the background.

A remarkable ability to emphasise the positive features of the LO, and minimise, or empathise with, the negative.

I would also add to Tennov’s list: a desire for exclusivity.
