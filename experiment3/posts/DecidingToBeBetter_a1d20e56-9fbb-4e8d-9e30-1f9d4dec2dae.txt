Does anyone else feel like all they do is work and sleep these days?
I'm on a night shift, so I've fallen prey to such a rut recently.

As of right now, my plan is that after work tonight, I will just go to bed by 1 AM and get alarmed out of bed by my phone at 7 AM; my phone will be on my desk in the living room, so I won't be tempted to look at Reddit during the night. 

Then, I will walk my dog, take a shower, brush my teeth, and go to the gym.

Just trying to work on my self, so I won't be a slave to a rut anymore.
