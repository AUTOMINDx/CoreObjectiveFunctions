As a kid, what did you think was more common/serious than it actually is?
As an 80s kid, I thought the following things were going to be much more common and a threat to my adult future:

1. Quicksand
 I really thought it would be everywhere. 

2. Death penalty by electric chair
 I thought this was a common punishment for anything and there wasn't a death row/waiting period and that it would happen to me.

3. Spontaneous combustion
 This one really had me concerned. My child mind thought that at any moment, a person could just be talking and suddenly, mid sentence, EXPLODE into pieces.
