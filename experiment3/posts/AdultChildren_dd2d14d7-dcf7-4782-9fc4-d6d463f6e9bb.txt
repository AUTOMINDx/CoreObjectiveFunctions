At least there’s justification for the alcoholic’s behavior
At least there’s a justified reason why my alcoholic dad is so fucked up towards me. In the case of my mother, who is not an alcoholic, there’s no excuse. She is literally just too delusional or pathetic to realize how fucking stupid she sounds when she takes the side of an alcoholic who can’t even remember where he is or what day it is. She will literally say “I believe your dad over you”. Ha. Ha. Ha.
