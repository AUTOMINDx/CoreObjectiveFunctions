How do I survive my dad's funeral tomorrow without anyone's support?
My (23F) dad's funeral is tomorrow. He died of covid after being in a hospital for 6 weeks. He doesn't have any family except for one cousin who lives on another continent, everyone else he had was his parents' generation and already died. My mother hates him and half of her family and friends who also hate him are coming. I feel so anxious about having to be around people who didn't love him in this. He was a well known artist and one portal found out the time and place of the funeral which then everyone published so there's going to be a lot of strangers as well. 

He was my favorite family member and the best person you can imagine. I looked up to him since I was a child. We hung out every single day. My mom and I don't have a good relationship and she's only talking trash about him even now that he died. I'm currently single and none of my friends lost a parent yet so they can't relate and support me. They're just telling me not to cry and not to be sad.  

I don't want to stand by my dad's coffin. I don't want to be touched by a bunch of people. I don't want to be looked at. I don't want to have to make casual conversation after the funeral. I just want to deal with this alone in peace.

Any advice on surviving tomorrow is welcome.

Edit: I can only see one of the 3 comments. Is there a reason for this?
