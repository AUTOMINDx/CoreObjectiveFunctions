Postgraduate Imposter syndrome?
I'm a UK MA (humanities) student and I'm deep into my first semester and have looming deadlines. I absolutely love what I'm studying, principally African/Haitian history and Postcolonial literature/politics, but the fields are so vast and complex. So much so that I often feel as though I'm an imposter scholar with no validity or credibility and no right to be making additions to this field. 

Did any you feel a similar way? If so, how did you overcome this feeling of being an imposter with no worthy contributions to your field?
