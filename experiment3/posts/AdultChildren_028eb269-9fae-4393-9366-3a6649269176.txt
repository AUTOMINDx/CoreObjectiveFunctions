I'll be thinking of everyone on this thread the next 2 days. &lt;3
My Dad is a recovering alcoholic. He's been sober 15 years but he is now 70 and he still has all the other traits of an alcoholic. He never held down a job and doesn't take care of his health and he isolates from people so he has no friends. He is mentally and emotionally unstable. If I had the money and power to commit him to inpatient psychiatric care I would. But his wife, my step mother, I care about a lot and she is 90 with COPD  and doesn't think she'll live much longer. So I am traveling this xmas season because I want to see her. 

But that doesn't change the fact that my dad is a recovering alcoholic who is a covert narcissist. My Mom is a big-ego narcissist along with my step dad AND my mother in law. Just when I think they can't out do each other in petty, selfish, childish games, they surprise me.

When I read other people's posts on the terrible things their family does to them during the holidays, I catch myself thinking " well then just don't be around them. stay home." I look at myself and say "ha! You can't take your own advice!". There's often extenuating circumstances...and it sucks so bad because it turns what should be a wonderful time of the year to extremely stressful and even traumatizing  days. 

What's getting me through it right now is thinking of all you folks on here. I'm not alone. I'm not crazy. And I am not to blame for my adult parent's abhorrent behavior. 

I'll be spending a lot of quiet moments with ya'll in my mind when I need to feel centered &amp; safe (aka when I have to lock myself in the bathroom to prevent blowing up or breaking down...maybe I'll see some of you in there too, in spirit? :] ).
