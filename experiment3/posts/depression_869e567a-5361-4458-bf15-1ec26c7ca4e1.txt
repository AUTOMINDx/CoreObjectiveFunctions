What the fuck is it with people and coming to talk when you intentionally try to avoid people?!
Like I walked all the way away from everyone and sat down to eat my bagel. This fucking coworker comes over and stands by me. For what?! Him being there draws someone else. Now there's a crew of people trying to small talk when I just wanted to take the five mins to be by myself. 

Lunch break. I go to my jeep. My door is closed. That is not an invite. This coworker comes over and taps at my window. So now I have to make small talk because I'm not rude. 

I really just want to be left alone. I know I'm at work, I know I have to be courteous to people, but these moments were mine and I wanted solace. Fucking leave me alone.

Edit:

Left work early. Went to the movies. Gonna watch Matrix and drink.
