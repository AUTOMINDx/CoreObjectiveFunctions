how to be less irritable
i (F19) am stupid irritable and i HATE it. i don’t wanna be an angry person and i can’t stand being frustrated all the time. everything pushes me over the edge, any little thing that goes wrong. 

the thing is my “pushed over the edge” isn’t me blowing up and yelling at anyone, it’s me isolating myself so i don’t be mean to anyone and then i just have to deal w the feeling of overwhelming anger just underneath for NO REASON and it doesn’t go away no matter what i do. i try breathing i try journaling i try counting i try pacing. it might physically calm me but i still FEEL the same amount of anger and i can’t do this anymore. i get so frustrated it’ll push me to tears. i asked my therapist for help and everytime she’d just make it worse and make my frustration worse to the point where i’d cry on my drive home. idk what to do anymore

edit: i have ADHD and anxiety but am not on meds atm
