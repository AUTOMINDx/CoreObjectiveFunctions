I am 24 male, almost 25, I feel like it hit a plateau in my professional and work life :( , what good advice can you give ?
I 24 M, living in the Parisian region ( moved here from an eastern european EU country) , I make 24k € a year after tax, I have 45k €  in my bank account just rotthing away bcs inflation , 2000$ in stocks ( down 10% bcs of the recent crash), 1500 € in crypto of which 1250 is in a fiat wallet,

I still live with my mom and I hate my life, I ve been working in the same company for the past 4 years ( my first full time job) . 

I started working in my company as a purchasing assistant and got promoted to lead data entry assistant ( I manage a team of 4 people). 

My skills include the following : management, intermediare level of excel, purchasing and negotiation. 

My income is low so finding an apparemment by myself is not easy at all, God willing I will find one next year. 

During this 4 years of work I've achieved a bachelors degree in management in a top bussiness school in France.

I was thinking to quit my job next year to find a better paying job or to continue my masters (one year of masters ) at 26 years or 27.

Can you guys give me some good advice, I have nobody to help me with some good advice, I strugle with mental health and tinnitus, other than that I think I am fine :)

Thanks in advance
