[Wonder Woman] Exactly what "truth" does her lasso compel out of people?
Let's say I planted a bomb in the city, WW captures me and loops the lasso around me to compel me to tell the truth. Would it be possible for me to avoid telling her where the bomb is by giving her entirely truthful, technically accurate, but completely useless answers?

For example, she says, "Tell me where the bomb is hidden." I choose an answer such as "Inside a car." I think this has the highest chance of working because I can forever play cat-and-mouse. She would then say, "Where is the car?" and I would say "In the city." She would say "Where in the city?" and I would say "Probably on a road or a driveway." Then "What color is the car?" and I would say "One of the primary or secondary colors." Etc, etc. I could always answer her truthfully and accurately, but never actually giving her information that she can act upon.
