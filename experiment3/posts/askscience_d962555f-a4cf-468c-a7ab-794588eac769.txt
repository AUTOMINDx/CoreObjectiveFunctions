Does the sun have tides?
I am homeschooling my daughter and we are learning about the tides in science right now.  We learned how the sun amplifies the tides caused by the moon, and after she asked if there is anything that causes tides to happen across the surface of the sun.  Googling did not provide an answer, so does Jupiter or any other celestial body cause tidal like effects across the sun?
