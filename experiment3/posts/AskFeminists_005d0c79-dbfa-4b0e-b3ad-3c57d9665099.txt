Why do men suppress their emotions?
I Was brushing up on some feminist theory when I came across an interesting quote from Bell Hooks. “Patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves … if an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.”

Is this phenomenon of men repressing their emotions caused by the patriarchy, or caused by the perceived desire of women to prefer unemotional men when selecting a sexual partner? 

In other words, do men repress their emotions because the patriarchy forces them to, or do they do so in order to “supposedly” become more sexually desirable to women?
