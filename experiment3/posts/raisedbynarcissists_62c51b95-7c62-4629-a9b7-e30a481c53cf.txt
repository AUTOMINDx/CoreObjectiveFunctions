Do you ever question if you are a narcissist?
I was raised by a narcissistic mother. Because of that, I feel like I have inherited narcissistic behaviors from her that cause me to sabotage my relationships. But I don’t think I am a full blown narcissist. (I experience empathy, guilt, accountability, etc.) But then sometimes I’m not sure, because I am having to unlearn all of these toxic behaviors that she taught me growing up. I feel like either I have been gaslit so much that I just struggle to fully comprehend my reality and who I really am, or I am actually a narcissist that can’t see what I am. Does that make sense? I find myself so confused about these feelings all the time. I’m not even sure if any of this made sense. Can anyone relate?
