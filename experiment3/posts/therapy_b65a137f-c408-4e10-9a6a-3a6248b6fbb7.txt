I have no clue where to start when it comes to going to therapy.
For a while now, I've thought about going and feel like it'll help me but I've always been skeptical because honestly I don't even know what to talk about. Finding the right therapist seems like such a fucking chore and the one time I looked up going to see one the wait times were outrageous.  Like it would have been months before I even would have had a session.  

Maybe my outlook on it is totally wrong. Did anyone else feel like this?
