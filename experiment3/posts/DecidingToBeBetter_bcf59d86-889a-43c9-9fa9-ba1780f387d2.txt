i haven't smoked weed since monday
i know it's not anything special, but i have smoked weed multiple times a day everyday for almost 2 years. i went through some real tough shit but after awhile i noticed how i couldn't remember simple things about the day before and was starting to forget some of my childhood which really scared me because i just turned 20. i don't wanna stop permanently, but i need to use it healthily again and for fun, not to not feel pain and to stop thinking. please give me some encouragement or advice or your stories maybe. thank you.
