Everything hurts and I'm so lonely
I made the mistake of reading something today that has a really cute relationship in it and really supportive friendships. And I'm usually lonely and it's really just a stor, but fuck.

 Everything just hurts so much right now? I don't have anyone to talk to and I feel like this is how it's always going to be. I feel like there is just so much wrong with me and I'm literally just sick of feeling so hopeless all the time. I don't even know anymore,.
