i was honest and told her that this obviously isnâ€™t something we can just move past and i really wanna fix it, so we have to sit down and talk about it or she can come to therapy with me if itâ€™d be easier, she told me weâ€™d deal with it later and i said okay.. a few hours later when i brought it up like she said to, she went off on me, she backed me into a corner and got angrier then iâ€™ve ever seen her before and to be fully honest it scared me

she basically yelled at me that sheâ€™s not going to therapy with me and whatever happened to me in my past wasnâ€™t her fault nor her problem and that something like this better never happen again cause she doesnâ€™t want to deal with me being an ungrateful bitch and feel that she has to walk on eggshells around me, she finished it saying i can do whatever i want and feel however i wanna feel but that we wonâ€™t be talking about it again and sheâ€™s not gonna put up with my issues surrounding sex anymore

i love her.. i really do, but after this idk how i feel. sheâ€™s never been like this before and i donâ€™t really understand what she means when she said something like this better never happen again cause she doesnâ€™t want to deal with me being an ungrateful bitch and feel that she has to walk on eggshells around me, or what she means when she says she wonâ€™t put up with my issues surrounding sex, that was the first and only time iâ€™ve ever shut down like that and it wasnâ€™t like i did it on purpose, i donâ€™t have any issues surrounding sex that i can think of besides me occasionally saying no/not tonight or just telling her to be gentler

and i would ask but sheâ€™s been mad and stomping around the house, not to mention saying weâ€™re not talking about it again

iâ€™ve decided im gonna ask to go stay with my dad for a while and that we should take a break, i invited one of my brothers over today so i guess iâ€™ll tell her i wanna take a break while heâ€™s here, while i trust her and i really donâ€™t think sheâ€™d ever hurt me, the way she acted today was.. completely different to how she normally is and it made me very nervous so iâ€™d rather be safe then sorry i guess 

thank you to everyone that commented, it helped a lot.

EDIT 

yeah.. i think iâ€™ve finally come to my senses, i didnâ€™t want to realize that i was being abused.. again. i feel ashamed that i was so blinded and passive but iâ€™m glad everyone here has helped me, im gonna get therapy and my dad has already prepared a room for me, iâ€™ll be leaving tomorrow to go live with him until i can get my own place, just to be safe iâ€™ll have my brothers get my stuff from her house for me and iâ€™ll officially break up with her on the phone while iâ€™m at my dads house cause if i did it in person i donâ€™t think sheâ€™d take it well ðŸ˜¬
