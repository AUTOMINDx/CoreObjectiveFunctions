Does this paper on Corporate tax rates by Philipp and Heimberger match other findings in the literature?
I came across this working paper: [https://wiiw.ac.at/do-corporate-tax-cuts-boost-economic-growth-dlp-5821.pdf](https://wiiw.ac.at/do-corporate-tax-cuts-boost-economic-growth-dlp-5821.pdf)

It analyses the literature on the impact of corporate tax cuts on growth. It seems to find that there is no clear effect on growth. 

Both on this sub and other places where I've seen discussion on CT, it seems to be frowned upon, some even asking for it to be slashed entirely, as a way to promote growth.

Do the findings on this paper clash with most other evidence on the topic?
