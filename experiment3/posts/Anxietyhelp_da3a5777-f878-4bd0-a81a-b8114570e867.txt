Not sure if anyone can help
Idk i am new to trying this but i feel like i have enough emotions in my body for 10 different people. I get easily anxious over the slightest thing that feels “off” to me and I don’t know how to properly manage my emotions. Not sure if anyone here can talk just to distract or even some advice. Idk this is new to me
