Is this normal or creepy for an endocrinologist?
I am 27F diagnosed with Celiac disease, which led to nutrient malabsorption, which led to osteoporosis, which led to me seeing an endocrinologist. The fact that I’m so young with osteoporosis is another story. 

Anyways, I’ve gone to my male endocrinologist twice now. Both times he has made me feel slightly uncomfortable. He gets very close when talking to me. Has complimented my hair, called me a young beautiful woman. And both visits he has had me stand up while he runs his hands down the sides of my body along my hips and thighs, he takes the side of his hand and pushes between my boobs, etc. 

I would just like to ask if this is normal for an endocrinologist? I mean I like to think the closeness and compliments are to make him more personable. And with feeling my body he is trying to feel my bone structure to make sure I’m healthy. But I don’t know. I don’t want to be naive. Typing this out makes it sound very creepy. 

Any endocrinologists out there that can comment or people who have experienced the same?
