My partner F(29) is getting bullied at work constantly and her boss won’t do anything.
She has an entire list of all the ways they have bullied her or attempted to ignore her when she asked them if they needed help. She’s been accused of not being a team player when they’re not giving her anything to help with. She’s gone to her boss already but it seems her boss is in on it and that is only making things worse. She’s afraid to go to HR and face retaliation and that it will only make things worse.
