CEN is more traumatizing than people think
The title. It’s *FAR* more traumatic than people think. It’s far more traumatizing than people know. I think it’s something that you can’t really understand how bad it is unless you’ve gone through it. Bc of course someone who’s been privileged enough to not endure emotional neglect would downplay it. They don’t understand, they haven’t lived it. And it’s horrible. People should be educated on the effects of this type of child neglect. They’re extreme. This stuff can physically shrink brains, cause children to severely dissociate, and just ruin a person’s entire life. Just like every other type of child abuse and neglect. Part of what’s so awful about it is that you don’t even understand the weight of it when you’re a kid. You don’t know *what’s* happening (not happening?) to you. It’s invisible, probably more invisible than emotional abuse IMO. (Though I’m not trying to compare or downplay, both are equally traumatic).

It’s draining. I plan on reading “Running on empty” some day, almost because of the freaking *title* alone. The title just speaks to me. Having endured CEN leaves you constantly tired. Having an emotionally barren childhood really does leave you “running on empty” all  afterwards. It’s like I was never fed the energy to go on. I’m running on empty every day.

Do you guys get what I’m saying?
