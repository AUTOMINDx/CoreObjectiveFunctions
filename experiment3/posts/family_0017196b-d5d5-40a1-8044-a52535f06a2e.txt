Wife lied about miscarriage and had an abortion
Hi, first of all I am a firm believer of woman's choice, so please no political views.

Ok so we have been married 10 years and have 3 beautiful boys, so me and my wife decided to go for a fourth, hoping for a girl. The stick turned blue so she went off to the docs for a scan etc. All normal aprox 9 weeks and doc said she should have a blood test as wife is now 37yrs. Blood tests came back normal and all was progressing well. Then a week later my wife bursts into tears saying she had been bleeding, obviously we were upset. She went off to the docs again and he confirmed a miscarriage. Five days later my wife came to me and admitted that it was not a miscarriage, she had self medicated with the abortion pill given to her by a shifty doctor but she was 14 weeks gone and the tablet did not terminate the pregnancy properly so she has to go to a neighbouring country to get an abortion as our home land does not do past 14 weeks. Oh and the reason she terminated the pregnancy is because the blood test showed it was going to be another boy. 
I am obviously furious she lied and decieved me and at the point where I don't know if I will ever be able to trust her again, possibly ending our marriage. My question is am I overreacting?
