DAE fantasize about experiencing ""real"" trauma?
All of my trauma was emotional in nature. No one ever hit me or raped me, and I only got called names by school kids in a manner that I'm sure happens to everyone. But ever since I can remember I've had fantasies/maladaptive daydreams about "real trauma", where I go through physical trauma, or actual torture, or something that the general public would agree would be traumatic. I wonder if I do this because I think if this happened people would accept that I am traumatized more. Or even that it would be okay to allow myself to be seen as such.
