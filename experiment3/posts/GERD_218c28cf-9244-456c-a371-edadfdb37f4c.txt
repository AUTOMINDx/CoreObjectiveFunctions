Why the Hell Has Nobody Figured this Out Yet?!
You'd think after all these years someone would have invented something to permanently stop reflux! This is insanity! I'm over here researching like crazy trying so many different things and nothing works! Can one person JUST PLEASE invent a magic pill or some kind of device that wraps around your stomach or some type of injection that stops reflux?! We need to use our brains more instead of just relying on PPIs! Let's figure something out! C'mon People!
