When there were flying dinosaurs with 40-foot wingspans, how big would their hunting range have possibly been?
Since I recently learned how huge the migration pattern of some hummingbirds is, I was wondering if there was a flying animal so large that it could travel the entire Earth looking for food.

Then I tried to think what the largest flying animal was and I think it might have been some of the biggest flying dinosaurs.  So I wonder what their hunting range could have been like?
