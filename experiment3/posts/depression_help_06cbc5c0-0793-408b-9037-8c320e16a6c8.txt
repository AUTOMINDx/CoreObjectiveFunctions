I finally managed to open my door and go for a walk
After about 2 years of locking myself in my flat, drinking and just hoping that the time passes fast I finally got myself together and left my flat to go for a walk without the crippling anxiety of what lies out there, I have been sober for about 5 months now, if you would have told me that a year ago I would have probably just let out a short laugh and then would have walked away. It felt so liberating, like breathing for the first time after being submerged in water. I still dont know how I did that without a therapist or help from friends (I mean there was no possibility of friends helping since nobody really gives a shit about me) but what my point is meant to be is just hold tight, things get better at some point and celebrate every small victory and be wiser than me, try to seek help
