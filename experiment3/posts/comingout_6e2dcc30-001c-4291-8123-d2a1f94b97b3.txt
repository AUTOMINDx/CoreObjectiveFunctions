I came out, and my family is just ignoring it
So my wife and I came out a couple of weeks ago (me as bi and her as trans). It went, well, a little better than expected. They pretty much immediately started calling her by the correct name and pronouns, but I could tell my mom was really upset but didn't want to show it. My dad said pretty much nothing.

The next day I made a Facebook post coming out to my extended family, and invited them to send a friend request to my second fb account where I've been posting about my wife and I for a year and a half. A handful of people have sent me friend requests there. Almost no comments or likes were from my family, just friends who already knew being supportive. The family who have followed me on my second account will interact with my posts as long as it has nothing to do with my wife/me being lgbt. 

I have no idea what to do for Christmas. We usually go to a party with my extended family every year. My parents want my wife to come with but have said themselves that there is going to be negative reactions from pretty much everyone. I get the feeling that they don't actually want her there and are just saying that because they don't want to end their relationship with me, and included the fact that my family won't be friendly as an attempt to dissuade me from bringing her. I want to reintroduce my wife to everyone but I don't want her to spend her Christmas uncomfortable. 

I'm sure others have had their families react in a similar way. Is this just my life now, my family completely ignoring my wife and my sexual identity? Or did they eventually come around? I'm so sad but I feel like I don't have room to complain. It's not like I got disowned. I just feel ignored.
