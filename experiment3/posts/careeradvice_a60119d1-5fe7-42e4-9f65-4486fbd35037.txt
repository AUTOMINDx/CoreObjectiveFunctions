Reason to tell coworkers and boss why I am resigning?
What’s the best reason to give the boss and coworkers why I am resigning. Real reason is I’ve observed bullying and a general lack of professional ethics at this company. Their IT and HR systems are also the worst I’ve seen in a 20 year career and pushing people to burnout. I’d prefer just to give them a broad generic reason just to leave professionally with no one being targeted (workers and the company) without any further questions.

UPDATE - thanks for everyone responding. Insights were very helpful. Took the path most listed below, “another opportunity came up that I couldnt turn down and the values of the company were better aligned to my career aspirations”. No follow up questions asked. Thanks all.
