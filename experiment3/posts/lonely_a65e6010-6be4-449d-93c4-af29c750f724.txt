Lonliness kills me daily. But I treated myself for once.
I'm alone every day. No friends. No social life. Just work, gym, repeat. :/

But I'm suffering so much I thought I'd treat myself to the new Xbox Series X. Financially always getting by with fears of the future and the fact we might get kicked out. But I never buy stuff for myself. I'm always trying to save. So I thought I should care for myself and if I haven't got anyone else to buy something for, I may as well give myself a gift right?

Just wanted to share that. And say you can do it too. Loneliness isn't fun and we need to treat ourselves when we can...

Thank you ❤️
