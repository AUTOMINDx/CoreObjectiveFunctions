How much of the Vedic Textual corpus is heavily influenced by the Native Indian Religion?
For example the Vedas, although already borrowing Dravidian words are largely similar to Indo-European religions while the Puranas differ widely and are clearly the product of Native and IE synthesis. What I'm sure about is the Upanishads, Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Gita embedded into it.
