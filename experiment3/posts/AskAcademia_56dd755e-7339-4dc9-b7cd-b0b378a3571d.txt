Nightmare scenarios where one might NOT get their PhD despite all best efforts
I’m currently writing a screenplay that involves a character who is working towards their PhD and could use a bit of insight from people who are familiar with this world. I have little experience in academia, so I want to make sure what I’m writing is plausible.

This character I’m writing is very passionate about their field of research, but ultimately fails or is unable to get their PhD for some reason. I know this is highly unlikely or very rare in the real world if you put in the work, but want to think about what some nightmare scenarios might be where the unheard of becomes reality. 

The thesis topic itself is not yet defined, but will be something incredibly niche in the Humanities. 

The tone of the film is meant to be semi-comedic/absurdist, so doesn’t have to be completely true to life. But for example, some ideas I’m throwing around that would cause this to happen:

\- a new piece of information emerges that completely invalidates the thesis  
\- the thesis undermines/invalidates the life work of the advisor (or someone on the panel), and is failed because that person cannot accept this  
\- the character’s advisor didn’t bother to read anything the entire time and when it gets to the panel, he is failed  
\- the advisor dies/quits and the topic is so niche that no one else in the world can advise him  
\- something happens in the world (eg. some kind of scandal or change in public perception) that makes the topic of research a complete no-go  
\- the department is dissolved due to lack of funding

Any of these seeming completely nonsensical?

Thanks for the help in advance
