How did Archimedes create the buoyancy formula before the discovery of Gravity?
Formula for buoyancy = F = pgV 
(Density * volume * gravitational acceleration)

How could Archimedes make a formula that uses gravity without actually knowing what gravity is? What did the original formula look like without “g”?
