Inability to feel emotions during therapy session?
I've always considered myself to be fairly numb emotionally. It's only recently that I started coming to terms with the fact that this might not be my default state, but rather the result of my upbringing.

A few sessions ago, the conversation naturally drifted towards my parents and my upbringing. My therapist took a very hard stance about something in regards to my parents, basically validating that something they had done to me was wrong. I immediately reacted by shutting down and dissociating, as though some emotion wanted to surface from within me, but couldn't.

It's only a few days later, when I was home alone, that my brain was able to process what was covered in the session, and all the associated feelings hit me like a baseball bat in the face. I ended up crying like I hadn't done in years. This was hard but ultimately a good thing because I had never allowed myself to feel those things before.

This made me realize that I can't stay connected to my feelings while in the presence of other people. My therapist caught on to this very quickly. He since figured out how to get me to disclose traumas slowly, so I won't shut down, thought that implies keeping me in a state were I'm disconnected from my inner feelings, as usual.

I kind of wish I could allow myself to have feelings in his presence though, as well as in the presence of other people.This happens to me even for small, everyday emotions. It's severely hindering my ability to bond with people and create lasting connections.

Plus, I'm basically downplaying the severity of my issues in therapy, by talking about them as though they had no emotional impact on me whatsoever. I'm afraid he'll conclude that I don't have real problems, or that my traumas are "healed" and terminate me, only because I failed to open up.

Any thoughts?
