(37F) All bloodwork is normal but I’m still sleeping 11+ hours a day
I’m a 37/F, no meds or health conditions other than being 20 lbs overweight (had this issue even when I was not overweight, though). All bloodwork (including thyroid, vitamin D, etc) is normal. I walk 10k steps daily and have for years. Generally a low carb, super healthy diet but binge eat sometimes on weekends, hence the extra pounds. Working on trying to get those off.

Yet I sleep 8-9 hours a night and then still nap at least 2 hours a day, sometimes 4-5 hour naps. This has been going on for years, even when I was thin. It’s really interfering with my ability to get things done. I’m constantly tired even when I don’t consciously feel depressed or bored. 

It’s the worst after exercise (I usually need a nap after my 10k steps) and after work. Any ideas what could be wrong with me? I can afford to get more tests done but I’m not sure what to ask for at this point.

Edit: I don’t snore.

Editx2: I’ve also been checked for endometriosis, pcos, mono, Covid (these issues started 20 years ago but have gotten worse as I’ve gotten older), and Epstein Barr and don’t have any of those either. Thanks to everyone’s input, I’m planning to do a sleep study and then get checked for ADHD if the sleep study comes back normal. Thanks so much!!

Updates:

1: Got a glucose meter and have been checking blood sugar regularly. No issues at all so far. Made an appointment for a sleep study so we’ll see how that goes.
