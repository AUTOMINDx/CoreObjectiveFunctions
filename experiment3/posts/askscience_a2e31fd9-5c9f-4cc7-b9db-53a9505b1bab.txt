Why do some Israeli scientists say a second booster is "counterproductive," and may compromise the body’s ability to fight the virus?
Israel recently approved a fourth dose for the vulnerable citing waning immunity after the first boost. Peter Hotez endorsed a second boost for healthcare workers in the LA Times. This excerpt confuses me though:

&gt; The proposal to give a fourth dose to those most at risk drew criticism from other scientists and medical professionals, who said it was premature and perhaps even counterproductive. Some experts have warned that too many shots eventually may lead to a sort of **immune system fatigue, compromising the body’s ability to fight the virus.**

&gt; A few members of the advisory panel raised that concern with respect to the elderly, according to a written summary of the discussion obtained by The New York Times.

A few minutes googling didn't uncover anything. I'm concerned because I heard Osterholm [mention](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/magellan-in-the-know/the-coming-viral-blizzard-XHv9nkeWfQ4/) (37:00) long covid may be the result of a compromised immune system. Could the fourth shot set the stage for reinfection and/or long term side effects? Or is it merely a wasted shot?
