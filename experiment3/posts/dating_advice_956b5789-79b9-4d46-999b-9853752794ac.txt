Dating is just like...the worst.
Had a date last night. Everything went well. Good conversation. Decent food, albeit fairly expensive for what it was, and we ended the night on a kiss after planning a second date for this week. To be completely honest, I didn't feel much of a spark but she was nice and definitely good looking. 

Annnd I didn't hear from her after that. I finally just asked her what's up and the response was "I just decided I like being single". Really? You couldn't have even mentioned that, or just said you're not interested? Why are people like this. Dating is just so emotionally and mentally exhausting, I don't really want to mess with it anymore.
