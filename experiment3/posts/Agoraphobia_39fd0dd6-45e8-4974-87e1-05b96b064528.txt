We are doing good!
To everyone suffering today: We are doing good! We are taking each day as it comes, we try our best, we break down, we get up and continue.

Living in constant anxiety and panic attacks for the simplest things like leaving the house is hell. But we are still fighting and we should be proud of ourselves.

Mental health is a serious disease and we all have our own reasons why we got sick in the first place. We should give each other way more credit. We are survivors in a constant battle with ourselves. It’s ok to feel bad, it’s ok to cry- but we‘ll always try to live this life.

All of you, feel loved and hugged today! You are doing good!
