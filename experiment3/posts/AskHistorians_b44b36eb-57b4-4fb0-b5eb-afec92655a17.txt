Did the first satellite pictures of earth clear up any misconceptions about the planet?
I know that mid-millennium explorers drew maps of wherever they explored, but a lot of those early "new world" maps look very different  from maps we use today. For example, I'm aware that some Spanish explorers falsely described California as an island. 

I'm curious if satellite images from space in the 1950s/1960s settled any then still-existing debates about earth's geography. Maybe an island wasn't as far away from the coast as previously thought? Maybe a forest wasn't as lush as people said?
