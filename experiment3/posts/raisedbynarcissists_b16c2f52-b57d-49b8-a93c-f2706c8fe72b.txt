People can smell they can treat me like shit
That's a common thing to experience after being raised by a narc? I see people trying to violate my boundaries more than with anyone else. It's almost like they can read my face, my posture, or something, and tell that I'm not 100% sure about my boundaries and asserting them, so my boundaries can be tried and can be violated.
