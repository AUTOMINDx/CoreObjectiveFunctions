A moral obligation to emigrate?
So this is a thought I have had for a while. For context, I live in a country that has been falling apart - service delivery is intermittent, corruption and crime are endemic, and the rule of law is hanging on by a thread if it is hanging on at all. As a result, skilled people have been emigrating en masse. The usual response is that by doing this they are inflicting a harm on their country of origin - since, had they stayed, they could (and would) have contributed to the country's betterment.

I am not so sure. I think perhaps they owe it to the country, on utilitarian grounds, to emigrate. Here are the conditions I think that must be satisfied for this to be true:

* the country's eventual collapse is inevitable;
* things will not get better before they get worse - collapse is a necessary, and perhaps sufficient, condition for the requisite political will to turn things around;
* civil society, and skilled people in general, can delay but not deny the country's eventual collapse.

Obviously, whether these propositions hold is an empirical question. But assuming they do, it follows (I think it follows) on utilitarian grounds that skilled people have a moral obligation, owed to their country of origin, to emigrate, since to do so hastens the country's eventual collapse, and therefore also its eventual rehabilitation.

I am interested in what this subreddit thinks, and whether any philosophers or perhaps political scientists have made similar claims.
