Help me dissect the obvious: Why is it that one shouldn't do what he wouldn't want done to himself?
I know it seems obvious, and I even believe it myself, but if someone were to press me for my reasoning, I don't know that I could come up with a deeper answer than "because it's just wrong."

*Why* is it wrong?

One might say that it's wrong because it's hypocritical, but why is it wrong to be hypocritical?
