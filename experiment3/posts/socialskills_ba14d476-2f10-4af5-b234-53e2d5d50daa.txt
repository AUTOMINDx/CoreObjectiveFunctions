Are you trying to make friends? OR are you just trying to get people to like you?
I'm 31 years old and only now I realize.

I don't think I've ever tried to make friends.

I've just wanted people to like me. Praise me. Compliment me. Think I'm smart, funny, cool.

Wanted women to give me their attention.

I don't think I've once really tried to get to know other people or fit in.

One time I was on a discord of psychology students studying Freud and psychoanalysis.

Everybody in the chatroom seemed so much more knowledgeable and intelligent than me.

It made me want to leave automatically.

Why?

Cause I wanted to be around people I felt I was better than. I didn't want to be around people who knew more that me.

Why?

Cause I'm deeply insecure.

Why?

Parents.. Bad experiences.. I know there's things a lot of things I'm bad at.. Areas where I'm incompetent.

I don't want to spend the rest of my life this way.

I need to grow up.
