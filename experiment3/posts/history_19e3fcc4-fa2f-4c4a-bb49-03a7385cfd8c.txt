David vs Goliath: Who was the only U.S. General killed in the American Indian Wars? (1775-1890)
General Edward Canby in the California Modoc Wars 1872-73. Commander in the Pacific Northwest.

----

The Modoc had lived near The Lava Beds in northeastern California. Forced to move to a reservation in Oregon which they had to share with their historical enemies, the Klamath tribe, they had pled with the US government to return to California. When the US refused, the Modoc left the reservation and returned illegally. In 1872, the US Army went to fight against them to force them back and the Modoc War broke out. 

The Modoc people all had native names that were difficult to pronounce, so over time they were given names like Boston Charley, Hooker Jim, and Steamboat Frank. The leader and shaman of the tribe was named Kientpoos, and he was called Captain Jack.



In the first major battle, 400 US soldiers (including cavalry
and howitzer units) attacked Captain Jack and his 52 Modoc Warriors.

Undaunted by Captain Jack’s strong defensive position, Lt. Col. Frank Wheaton, the Army’s local commanding officer, had wrote that he fully expected that a day’s battle would “make short work of this impudent and enterprising savage.”

The Modoc took advantage of the lava ridges, cracks, depressions, and caves, all such natural features being ideal from the standpoint of defense. Tule Lake bounded the Stronghold on the north and served as a source of water. The Modoc repulsed troops advancing from the west and east. 

The U.S. Army lost 35 men killed and 25 enlisted men wounded (and then retreated). Captain Jack's Modoc suffered no casualties.

Chastened by the defeat, Wheaton, who had commanded troops in the civil war, wrote, “I have never before encountered an enemy, civilized or savage, occupying a position of such great natural strength as the Modoc stronghold, nor have I ever seen troops engage a better-armed or more skillful foe.”

The Army withdrew and decided to try and negotiate a treaty. But the Modoc didn't think they would compromise and believed that if the Americans lost their leaders, the Army would leave- and so plotted to kill them. 

Captain Jack had been reluctant to agree to the killings, believing it "coward's work", but was pressured by other warriors to agree. He insisted on being given another chance to ask Canby to "give us a home in our country." When the negotiators (including General Canby) showed up and told the Modocs that they had to return to the reservation "or else", Captain Jack attacked and his first shot killed General Canby.

With Ellen's Man, one of his lieutenants, they shot Canby again twice in the head and cut his throat. The Modoc also killed Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a peace commissioner, and wounded others in the party.

Nine days later Captain Jack and his band counter attacked the 12th Infantry Division killing 24 soldiers and wounding 17. Eventually, the military began to capture the Modoc one by one. Then, when they captured Hooker Jim, they hit the jackpot when he offered to take the U.S. Army to the cave where Jack was hiding.

Captian Jack was captured and the Modoc lost the war. Over the course of the war, Jack’s band of 53 men faced more than 500 soldiers including infantry, 100 cavalry and 2 artillery units and another 500 assorted militia. 

They killed 83 and wounded 47 while losing only a dozen men in battle.

After brief trials, Captain Jack was found guilty of war crimes—a charge unique in all of the Indian Wars. He was allowed no council and his jury was the military.

The Supreme Court Of The United States ruled "Indians", were not entitled to be considered lawful combatants:  'All the laws and customs of civilized warfare,' the Court opined, 'may not be applicable to an armed conflict to Indian tribes on our Western frontier.' Jack was hung.

The cost to the government of the Modoc insurgency was estimated at $4 million. And the estimated cost of the land that the Modocs wanted for a separate reservation? Twenty thousand dollars.

While it was the last major campaign to be fought against Native Americans in California, The Battle of Litte Bighorn in Montana was just three years away (1876).

George Armstrong Custer was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers at age 23 in the civil war, but after the war, Custer was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army and was sent west to fight in the Indian Wars where he lead and lost The Battle of the Little Big Horn. Five of the 7th Cavalry's companies were annihilated and Custer was killed. The total U.S. casualty count included 268 dead. 

General Canby served in the Second Seminole War in Florida, saw combat during the Mexican–American War, and coordinated a campaign against the Navajo in New Mexico. In the civil war, Canby forced the Confederates to retreat to Texas after the Union's strategic victory at the Battle of Glorieta Pass. Canby also commanded the Union forces to win the Battle of Fort Blakeley, which led to the fall of Mobile in 1865.


SCOTUS. When he was the Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General at the Office of Legal Council in the early-2000s, John Yoo cited the Supreme Court's Modoc ruling, to argue that the USA was entitled to torture captives apprehended in Afghanistan, because they, like "Indians", were not entitled to be considered lawful combatants.
