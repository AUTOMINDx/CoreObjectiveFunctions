My girlfriend died a year ago today
As mentioned, she passed away on the 24th last year. I see a lot of people get super hyped for Christmas but it only makes me feel worse. I don't know if I'll ever be able to enjoy it tbh

Anyway, have a good Christmas everyone

Edit: Thank you everyone for all the love, I hope you all had a great Christmas Day ‚ù§
