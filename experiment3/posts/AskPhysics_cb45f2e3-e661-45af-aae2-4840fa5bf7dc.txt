Criticism of the Copenhagen interpretation
I’ve been reading up on the many worlds and Copenhagen interpretation. I’ve managed to find a lot of resources which criticizes the MWI but it’s been very hard to find any sources criticizing the Copenhagen interpretation. Does anyone have an idea where to look? Are there specific areas of the CI that have been criticized heavily?
