Song for people struggling with anxiety and intrusive thoughts
Hey y'all. I wrote this song as a letter to my OCD/Anxiety, who I have affectionately named Samantha. I wrote it as kind of a letter/cathartic lullaby to the voice in my head. It has brought me and other people in my life some comfort, and I wanted to share it with the community.
