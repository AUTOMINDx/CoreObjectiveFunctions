I just want a fucking APOLOGY from them || Vent
he/him - transmasc nonbinary

I had the chance to confront my abuser. Someone who used to be my best friend. And the moment they saw my messages to them, they silently deleted their Reddit account. And I feel so DEFEATED. I just want fucking CLOSURE. I want most of all an APOLOGY for the hurt they caused me. The emotional abuse, sexual trauma, manipulation, trauma dumping, EVERYTHING. But I won't get that because they are a fucking COWARD who can't seem to want to hold themselves accountable. They'd rather run away than face the consequences of their actions. The consequences of abusing their very young friend 6 years their junior. I have no hope. I just want to end it sometimes.
