Keeps getting lonelier and lonelier each year come Christmas time
I can't help but think my mental disorder makes it hard for me to just be at peace with everything that goes on around me on Christmas. I've been doing therapy and one of the things I learned there was that I can be self-sufficient and can use tools to self-regulate when I'm feeling down.

But this time of the year has been tortuous for me. I'm much more self-conscious now and I just wonder if my depression is gonna make it worse and worse each Christmas, moving on.
