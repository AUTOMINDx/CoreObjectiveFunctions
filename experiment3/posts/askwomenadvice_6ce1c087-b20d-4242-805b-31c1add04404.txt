How do you get your partner to comfort you when they can’t/don’t?
I feel like I’m going crazy. Recently moved and adjusting to new city poorly. Partner isnt/doesn’t know how to comfort me despite me clear despair. He often makes it worse, acting as if my stress is an inconvenience and moping  around himself and then I am the one that comforts him. Rinse, Repeat.

Have  you found yourself frustrated that your SO can't comfort you at the very time you need it the most? Is he or she unable to see that your eyes are bloodshot? Incapable of empathizing with your pain? Or just afraid of your inevitable tears?

How do you solve this even when you’ve given them clear solutions “i’m looking for you to tell me things will be ok” etc. and they still can’t comprehend. is this possible to work through?
