:( I feel like I might loose insanity if my mind keeps doing this too long. ( please tell me that I'm not alone)
Has anyone ever had an issue where there's a word( same word, over and over again) that keeps popping up your  head(thoughts) and when you try to forget it you remember it by remembering that you forgot it in the first place?
