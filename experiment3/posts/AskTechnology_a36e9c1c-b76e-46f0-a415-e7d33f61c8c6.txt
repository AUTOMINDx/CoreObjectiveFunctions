Is it possible to build a hdmi switch that has a wireless connection and has a touch screen user interface?
Hi, I've been researching ways to upgrade my computer setup and make it more compact.

Firstly, I found out wireless hdmi existed then I wondered if it's possible to be able to switch between my xbox and my pc with a device that has touch screen interface, I guess I'm trying to find where to start it.
