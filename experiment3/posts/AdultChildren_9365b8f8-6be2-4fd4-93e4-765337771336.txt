Triggered by drunk neighbor.
I got a knock on my door at 10pm and it was my neighbor. He told me he’s drunk and he can’t find his phone. And my dumb ass took my phone to call his phone. He’s so drunk that he can’t remember his number. I couldn’t really help him so I told him that I’m sorry and closed my door. 

After a minute he knocked again and there’s instant trigger, I had a panic attack, I was scared, I got triggered. 

My father have a drinking problem during my childhood and It was traumatic. My mom would tell me to lock my door whenever he’s drunk, I never understood the reasoning behind it. But whenever she tells me to lock my door I get nervous and anticipate that my dad would knock on my door. 

It took me a good 15 minutes to calm down. It’s been over 20 years and the trauma is still creeping in.
