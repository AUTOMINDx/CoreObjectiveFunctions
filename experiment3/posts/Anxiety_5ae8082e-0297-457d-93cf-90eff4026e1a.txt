Anxiety is crippling and I wish the people around me knew.
Hi, F 25 here. I suffer from anxiety and was diagnosed when I was 14. It is an absolute nightmare to live with. Every day I struggle to keep my mind clear because I cannot stop thinking about a lot of things. It’s so loud and rapid. I give myself headaches and some days I can’t even cope. I take Panadol to relieve my headaches. I cry when things don’t go right or if people talk to me in a certain way. Sometimes I completely shut down and disassociate. Also, I’m pretty sure I have anger issues. I have a very negative view of myself and the world. I hate social situations and feel like I can’t talk to people my own age . People make me nervous and I’m always scared. I think I’m the biggest loser in the world and that I deserve every bad thing that happens to me. I call myself so many bad names. My anxiety is crippling. It stops me from making friends (currently have about 1-2 close friends). It stops me from going to work. I over think everything. All of this isn’t even the half of it. I don’t know how to stop my brain. I feel nervous to talk to people I’ve know for years. I really do find it hard to open up. I’m tired. I used to think I could conquer the world but I feel like I’m losing a fight here.

Edit: thank you so much for the kinds messages, you are all so kind and I’m grateful. I am not on medication at the moment. I went off it quite some time ago. I am going to my doctors to try new meds. I have seen a counsellor a few times but I always feels as though I’m wasting their time. Again, my dumb ass mind makes me feel that I’m overreacting and nothing I feel is valid. Working on this currently. My counsellor is super duper amazing and has used a lot of great techniques on me. I am working on seeing him again also. Thank you all.
