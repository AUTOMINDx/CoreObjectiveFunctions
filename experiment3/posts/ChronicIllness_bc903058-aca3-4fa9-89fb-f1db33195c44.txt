Just had to cancel an appointment I waited 3 months for because no one will take me
So, the background is I have a type of cancer that affects my spine that doesn't go away. You fight it off and it will go into temporary remission but because it is in my plasma, it will always come back unless I become a candidate for a stem cell transplant and it is effective. I can walk very short distances (like to and from the car at most) and I can drive but I cannot push myself in my wheelchair because I have compression fractures of my C4 vertebrae due to the damage the cancer did. I was told at an oncology appointment that she suspects I may have either colon cancer or a bleed somewhere else in my GI system because my red blood cells had been trending down slowly over the past year. She setup an appointment for me to see a gastrointerologist but the appointment was 3 months away. Husband got scheduled last minute for social security disability testing last minute on the same day and time as my appointment. There is nobody else who can or will take me. I asked a relative but they said no.  I know stuff comes up and appointments need to be rescheduled but it really sucks not to have anybody to take me to appointments other than my husband. I figured you guys would understand my venting/whining. I had so many people who I thought were my friends until I got sick and then I discovered how one sided our friendship really was and that I was the one always going to see them, planning stuff, etc and I would have never hesitated to take them to an appointment. I have to wait for the doctor's office to get back to me to reschedule so who knows when the new appointment will be.
