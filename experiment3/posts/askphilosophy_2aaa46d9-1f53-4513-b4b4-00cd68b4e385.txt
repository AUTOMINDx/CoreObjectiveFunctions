Can you claim an identity that isn’t born? (Contrasting gay, transgender, and transracial)
I’ll try to explain what I mean. Early in the gay rights era, people would claim that gay people were born gay. Since they were born gay, and couldn’t choose otherwise, they shouldn’t be discriminated against.

In orthodox transgender rights, people will claim that trans people have a medically observable gender dysmorphia. Transitioning is seen as a healthy way to alleviate this dysmorphia.

For the moment I will leave it bracketed that people who claim transracial dysmorphia aren’t backed up by medical science—I have no idea, and it’s not directly relevant. But let’s just say it isn’t.

But what happens if we change our motivation for granting rights or equality. What if we say, it doesn’t matter if someone is born gay—even if they’re not born gay, they should still be free to do what they want. And if we move to the transgender issue, what if we say, it doesn’t matter if someone has dysmorphia or not—they should be free to do what they want. After all, we wouldn’t demand to see a transgender person’s medical certificate before we allowed that they were actually transgender.

My question is, once we grant that there is a volitional basis for supporting gay people and trans people—that people can engage in same-sex activity or gender transitioning regardless of whether they can prove it is is innate, and that a sudden scientific discovery that found it was *not* innate wouldn’t mean we would have to eliminate equality rights for these groups,

Why then is it unavailable for a transracial person to say, I want to transition racial identity simply because I want to? It seems like some distinction is made between these groups because it’s taken by some that gayness or transness has some innate quality—but it seems like there are other arguments that say, no, pure volition itself is enough. Why doesn’t volition apply to a transracial person?
