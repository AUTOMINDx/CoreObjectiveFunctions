how can i get rid of my 'judgy mindset'
i really cannot stand this ''toxic environment' inside my head don't know if it's unconscious or not, but i feel like in my head i judge people too much. it's not even 'oh, that looks bad' kind of simple thing, like real mean thoughts or making fun of stuff &amp; people. and the fact is i truly hate that when this happens, but i really don't know how to stop it. deep down i feel like this affects my all kind of social relationships because i feel like if i do something wrong, people would make fun of me inside their head just like me. obviously i would never know if they do or not, but at least getting rid of this thing would make me feel way more comfortable communicating people and help me be a kind human being. would like to hear your thoughts about this. thanks in advance.
