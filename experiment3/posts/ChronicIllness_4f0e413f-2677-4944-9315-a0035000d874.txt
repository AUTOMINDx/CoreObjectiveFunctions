I’ve had an AMAZING doctor for the past 5 years, she’s the best doctor I’ve ever had. I found out today that I’m being forced out as a patient (among many others), because I’m poor and disabled.
I’ve been going to a clinic with healthcare providers that are certified in functional medicine since 2016. This clinic is one of the best things to happen to me health-wise. The one downfall is that they don’t accept health insurance, but they offer memberships to people that came with great perks. 

As a member (which was $50/month when I joined), I got unlimited one hour appointments at no extra charge. All of the lab testing was drastically discounted and supplements bought in house were also discounted. There were other perks as well, like I got a whole body bone scan for free! 

I got the best medical care of my life there, I actually trusted and respected my providers, and they gave me the same respect. They took me seriously when virtually no other doctors would. 

After several years of being a member, the monthly fee had gradually increased until it was $100/month, and the clinic was taking on sooo many patients that I could only get in to see my Dr. maybe 3 times a year. I had to wait 3-4 months just to get an appointment. I couldn’t afford to pay $100 a month since I am on disability, and it made no sense to if I could only see her 3 times a year.

So I cancelled my membership 2 years ago but remained a patient and she assured me it wouldn’t affect our doctor/patient relationship, and it didn’t…until now. I had an appointment with her today, and all was well until I went to checkout to pay and set up my next appointment.

I was informed that starting in January 2022, the clinic would ONLY be accepting MEMBERS as patients. I said that I was a member for years but had to cancel it because I’m disabled and couldn’t afford it anymore. All I got from the receptionist was 🤷‍♀️. I got in my car and cried, that was 5 hours ago and I’m still crying. 

I fucking HATE the way healthcare is managed in America, just as much, if not more than I hate my broken, illness riddled body.
