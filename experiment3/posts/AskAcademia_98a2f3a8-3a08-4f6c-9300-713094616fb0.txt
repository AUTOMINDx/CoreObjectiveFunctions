Anyone do a postdoc even if they had no interest in academia?
Some years ago I did a postdoc at a dream institution of mine for a field of physical science, from which I had been rejected for bachelor's and PhD admissions. When I started my PhD at my still well ranked but not super fancy name program, I had some interest in academia; by the time of PhD defense I had lost all interest, but I still did the postdoc because I really wanted to go there. When I got the postdoc offer, I took it without hesitation, because 1) I had always wanted to go there, 2) I thought the institution name on my resume would be useful in the future (no idea if it helped my career but it has at least boosted my self esteem), and 3) I did like the topic greatly. After a year and a few months having fun, I got a job in industry at a company I like, making better money.

Anyone do something similar?
