Lesbians love me, but men don’t
Do any other straight women have this happen to them? Lesbians try to hit on me, but men don’t approach me whatsoever in real life. My friends tell me that I don’t give off a gay vibe at all. I’m not intimidating and I’m quite friendly/approachable, so I don’t understand why this happens.
