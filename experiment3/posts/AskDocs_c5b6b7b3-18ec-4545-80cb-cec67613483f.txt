26M - Received first dose of Pfizer Vaccine back in July ‘21. Found out pharmacist trainee did not dilute the vaccine. What should I do?
Let me start off by saying when I received the vaccine I waited the full 10-15 minutes in the pharmacy to make sure everything was fine (which it was) I started walking out and they went over the store intercom telling me to get back to the pharmacy immediately. When I came back the pharmacist informed me that the trainee did not dilute the Pfizer vaccine and I received more than the recommended dose. She told me that this has never happened before and that I shouldn’t get the second shot due to this error. I immediately went to the ER to be evaluated and all of the nurses and nurse practitioners told me that they never heard that the Pfizer vaccine required dilution and that I should still get the second shot. They discharged me within a couple of hours. 

I never ended up getting that second shot, and I have just recently recovered from Covid about three weeks ago. My symptoms were mild, mainly body aches and sinus pressure. 

But now that the omicron variant is here, it has me worried and wondering if I should get the second shot now. I don’t have a primary physician, so the only advice I have been given was from the pharmacist and the nurse practitioner which contradict each other. I hope someone here can help me out and put my mind at ease because my anxiety over the past 5 months has been hell over this.
