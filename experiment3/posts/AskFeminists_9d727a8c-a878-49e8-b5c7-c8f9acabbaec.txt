Equality of opportunity in career fields that are dominated in numbers by one gender - feminist perspectives
Hello everyone, I wanted to ask feminist opinions on improving opportunities for working in careers that are dominated in numbers by one gender.  A couple of examples: CEOs are currently more likely to be men.  This holds true in all countries.  What would be the best way of improving opportunities for women in that field?  

In Britain, the field of writing children's fiction is heavily dominated by the ladies in terms of numbers.    What is the feminist perspective in improving opportunities for men in that field?

And there are other such careers - teaching, nursing, firefighting ... the list goes on.
