I hate cbt I hate ‘MiNdFuLLNess’
I could literally get shot and they’d be like ‘did you try deep breathing???’ ‘how about downloading the app that has literally all its content paywalled???’ 5 years I can’t do this shit anymore lol

I remember when I was completely delusional and legitimately could not hold a pen, let alone write. Kept yelling at me because I couldn’t write positive thoughts 

I know both are completely valid exceptional forms of therapy but they just don’t work on me. The only thing keeping me from pulling all my hair out and running around for hours is the frustration I get from all this. Hmm maybe it does work lol

My ability to function and create a decent future for others is in my hands. I just wished my brain worked, I’m going nowhere and probably never going to change. All my goals and future plans are out of the window, I just want to function like any other average person
