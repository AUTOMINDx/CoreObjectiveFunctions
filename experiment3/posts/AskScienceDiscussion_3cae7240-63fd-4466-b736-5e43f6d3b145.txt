Is 70% protection from hospitalization against Omicron good or bad?
I read in a paper (https://www.africanews.com/amp/2021/12/16/two-pfizer-jabs-give-70-protection-from-omicron-s-africa-study/) that two shots of the Pfizer vaccine gives 70% protection against severe disease/hospitalization from the Omicron variant. Full disclosure, I’m vaccinated and got my booster recently, so I guess I’m just curious by the wording: it sounds like 70% protection is supposed to be a good thing, but doesn’t that mean you have a 30% chance of being hospitalized after two shots? Isn’t that a risky chance to take? Or am I understanding it wrong?
