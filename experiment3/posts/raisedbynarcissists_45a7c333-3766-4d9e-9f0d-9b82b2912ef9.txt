If you’re here and you can relate to content, you were horribly abused as a child for a long time. Full-stop. And it is not a matter of opinion.
I have a long and miserable life story, but I have a bachelor’s degree in music education and own a private music lessons school and work all day with privileged children, for a decade now.

I have taught thousands of private music lessons to the children of doctors, lawyers, engineers, business owners, public educators, therapists, the list goes on. 

I had to take and pass all of the standard basic public educator courses that they make a music education major take, i.e. my degree means that I am supposed to be legal to teach in any public school system in the US. I used the training I received to open my business, and chose to do that instead of teaching public Ed.

Nurses know their way around a hospital. I know my way around a school. I regularly have fun discussions with old professors about music pedagogy. 

All that is to say, when I learned to finally hold my parents’ to the same standard that I was taught, it was like discovering a deafening tinnitus of the soul had been there my entire life but I could not place it. Because I was utterly qualified on paper to tell them that they were bad parents. As in, all of child psych in this textbook right here says so. My experience says so.

Good parents:

Do not force their children to participate in scenarios where they know the child cannot win (zone of proximal development)
Do not act one way in public and another way at home (“Who you really are when no one else is around” )
Give a shit about what Piaget had to say.

If you have any questions about how your parents handled your education, or want to know what good parents generally *do*, I have watched thousands of childhoods unfold. Ask away. It led me here.
