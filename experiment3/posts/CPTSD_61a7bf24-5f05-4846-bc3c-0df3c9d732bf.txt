Does anyone else (DAE) fantasize about getting sick or injured as a form of escapism but don't actually want to die?
I guess that what I'm describing could be boiled down to intrusive, escapism thoughts, but I have always wondered whether there are others who do this, and how this is all connected to CPTSD. I feel shame for these thoughts, so I don't end up expressing them to anyone, which then means I have no idea whether I'm alone in these feelings or not. And because I've been gaslighted for basically my entire life by a collection of shitty people, sometimes I have no idea what's real or what's common, or whether I really am \*fill-in-the-blank-criticism-I've-been-told\*.

Anyways, these thoughts often happen when I think about work or tasks/activities that involve me having to be "on". Especially after having a long weekend and coming back to work today, I find myself fantasizing about what could happen to me that could act as a "good/valid enough" reason for me not to have to work, and these are different than suicidal thoughts-- I don't want to escape *forever,* just for a little while.

Here are some examples: "what if I got into a car accident, but it wasn't so bad that I died, but bad enough that I broke a bone and have to spend weeks out of work?" Or "What if the stomach ache I have right now actually turns out to be a stomach virus and then I don't have to do *xyz*?" What's interesting is that I also have separate hypochondriacal thoughts about getting sick, but the thoughts I've described above are almost the equal-opposite of that because in these cases, I *want* to be sick or injured.

I have a feeling I do this because I've denied myself/others have denied me validation for so long that rest is okay and a "good enough" reason to cope with depression as-is, but because I chronically don't feel good enough, my reasons for wanting to rest and be alone are also not going to be good enough. Does this resonate with anyone?
