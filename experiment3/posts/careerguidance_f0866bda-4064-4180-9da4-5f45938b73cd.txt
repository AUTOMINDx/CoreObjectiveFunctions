Interview process amazing, but gets dropped right before the offer stage. 5 TIMES. Why???
Asking for my partner. Donâ€™t know what to do at this point. Heâ€™s a well qualified individual with great interview skills (Iâ€™ve listened into a few with my PR filter on and was impressed). He gets good feedback from the interviewers, always goes a couple of rounds with people in escalating levels of power, and we are so sure at that point weâ€™ll hear back with an offer. But itâ€™s been about five times now where the interviewer rejects him without any explanation at all. 

Weâ€™ve changed his references to people we know we can 100% trust and Iâ€™ve scrubbed the internet for anything inappropriate (nothing there), but have no idea other than that.

Anyone else experiencing this? Or have any ideas?? ðŸ¥º
