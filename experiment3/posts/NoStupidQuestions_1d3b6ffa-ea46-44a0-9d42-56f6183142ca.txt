Is it weird for a straight man to want an emotional connection before having sex?
I've been having sex with women, and I just don't feel like doing it anymore. I'm lonely and all I want is a genuine connection. I'm still horny, but I just don't want to have sex with anyone. At least, not just random girls. I had a date set up for tonight and I cancelled it.
