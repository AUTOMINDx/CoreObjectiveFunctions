Is the main reason why companies don't fire bad employees because it creates an uncomfortable situation? Or is this too vague?
I feel like throughout my career, I've seen bad employees (including myself), not get fired for bad performance.

The only thing I can think if is that firing an employee creates an uncomfortable situation.
