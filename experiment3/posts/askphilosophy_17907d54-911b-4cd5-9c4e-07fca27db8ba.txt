Capitalism falls but we don't get socialism. Are there any serious theories on this?
I often hear people saying that we should fight capitalism in order to get better living conditions. 

While there is certainly some truth to that, it seems me na√Øve to assume all post-capitalist societies will be better for the workers and rhe average person.

For example, if America had a second revolution but instead of becoming socialist, it became some dystopian neofeudalist system in which workers were tied to their place of birth through debt and credit scores. (either through a failed revolution or through corruption after the revolution)

Are there any philosophers (i.e. I am not looking for fiction writers) who examined in this question?

Note: before anyone mentions the USSR, I don't consider it to be a good example here because: 1) Despite all its problems, it tried to lift the living conditions of its citizens. 2) It tried to socialize the means of production. 3) Russia wasn't really capitalist when Lenin took power.
