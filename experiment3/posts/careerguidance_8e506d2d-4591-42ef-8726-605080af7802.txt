Am I the only old geezer (OG) who doesn’t want to manage a team?
I’m a white collar worker. I have decades of experience but find myself just wanting to do a good job and not have to manage people. I’m considered an expert in my field but when I look for positions for someone with my experience the job description always say you need to manage a team of people. Honestly I’m just tired of that, especially if you have someone on your team who is a slacker or needs to be micromanaged. Does anyone else feel the same way? If I apply for something lower, I would be out of the pay range.
