I miss my old life so much, before my anxiety was so bad
I can’t do shit anymore. I feel like a prisoner in my own body. I can’t eat whatever I want or however much I want because it’ll upset my stomach. I can’t drink regular coffee or energy drinks because the caffeine will make me anxious and dizzy. I need my Xanax anywhere I go like a fucking safety blanket. I need gum or mints wherever I go because when I get anxious my throat gets dry and I panic. Going out in public to a place I don’t know makes me anxious so I miss out on doing shit. I don’t know what happened the last couple months but my anxiety has been at an all time high. I just upped my Zoloft maybe that’s why I feel so down tonight.
