[NY] Should I respond to email from fired coworker?
My boss fired a new hire we just brought on a week ago to work under me. On their second day of work, the new hire disappeared from work for hours with no notice and was not responding to text or email. When they did reappear, they gave a bad excuse about needing to go to the store to fix their computer (we are WFH). We had a deadline that morning, so I had to do their work in order to meet it. My boss talked to them about the importance of communication &amp; that it can't happen again. 

I've been traveling for work this week so I've been out of the loop at work, but my boss notified me that he decided to let go of the new hire because they continued to disappear from work for hours. The new hire emailed me from their personal account talking about how heartbroken and confused &amp; felt they were let go too abruptly. They are asking me if I would ask my boss to reconsider. I did like them as a person and personally would have given it a bit longer to see how it worked out, but I also understand why my boss decided to do it. I'm initially hesitant to respond because this was my bosses decision, not mine, but I do feel bad that they are confused since they was working under me and I wonder if they think that I had input into the decision. Should I respond to their email or is it best to just leave it alone?

Thank you in advance.
