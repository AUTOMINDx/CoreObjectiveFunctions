How do I get over people who haven't been in my life for years?
Romantic and nonromantic there are people from my past who I just can't get over. its been almost 2 years since I've spoken to one of them but still it feels like I think of them everyday and base other relationships on them. I'm always asking myself if I should reach out but I know I shouldn't because things didn't necessarily end well and its my fault. when we did talk I felt like they were my platonic soul mate. they aren't the only person from my past I find myself thinking about a lot. how do you get over the people who have left a large impact on you?
