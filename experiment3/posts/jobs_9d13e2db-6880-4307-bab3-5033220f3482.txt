Why can't we just say we want money in interviews?
When an interviewer asks you why did you apply for the role, why do we have to say things like "greater opportunities" and "passionate about short term insurance". The interviewer has also been interviewed, they know that they wanted their job for money, why should they hold it against us when we say the same. I've never got it.
