I just had my last tooth filling done. I had 6 fillings and an extraction this year plus a deep cleaning that took two days and I am finally done!
I decided in January to bite (ha) the bullet and go to the damn dentist. I had been putting it off FOR YEARS. My teeth went from horrible to amazing in a year, and I am so proud of myself. My dentist and my hygienist are so freaking proud of me as well and that also feels amazing. They can't believe the progress I have made. Dental hygiene is a really great place to start if you want to do better.
