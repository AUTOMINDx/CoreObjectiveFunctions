Just turned 28, need a real career
Is it too late to get a high paying job in some serious field? I've been a teacher for 3 years and haven't done any other serious work before that. Is there a way to transition to like working for a big bank or tech or something for a shitton of money. I have a humanities degree. I feel like I wasted my time and now I'm past the age where people with these kinds of jobs start out. Don't they usually intern during summers in college?  

How do I transition to any kind of high paying job within 5 years? I dont have any specific interests.

Edit: I am teaching English at a private academy abroad. Teaching in the US is definitely a serious profession where you can make decent money in the long term. Nonetheless, I would like to transition away from teaching.
