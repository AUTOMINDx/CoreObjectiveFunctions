My Therapist Doesn’t Know How to Help Me Thread
This thread is for the people whose therapists don’t know what to do to help them bc they’re fcked up.

Mine has admitted more than once she is frustrated for not knowing how to properly help.

She says she doesn’t know which of the many strings in the tangle to pull on first.

I think she feels like she is just running around trying to put out different fires in the burning building.

I think I make her feel like a bad therapist because she feels challenged this way.

She specializes in trauma/CPTSD, so that doesn’t seem to be the problem?

I just think I’m unhelpable, but she keeps insisting I am… 

despite the fact I am apparently making her question her skills and capabilities.

I think I’m one of those people who needs meds to do this work, but my psychiatrist is a bit stumped, too.

I really like my therapist and find her smart and generous, tbc, and I hate that I am making her feel this way.

If this is you, too, please share your feelings.
