EM tries to catnap
PART 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/rdl3h3/em_tries_to_catnap_part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Background info: I am deaf and live in a deaf community, and I own a Birman cat named Tim. Also, due to having been robbed 2 separate times (I lived in L.A.) I always have the highest end cameras and they are everywhere. Keep in mind this is “translated” from ASL

Cast: Me - OP  Tim, EM, EK.

Also, formatting I am on mobile

Set the scene: It was 2 months after I moved into my new house and it’s 11:00 pm, and my Parents were not home (I’m still a minor not living by myself) When I moved into my house I quickly noticed that the new neighbors were not very welcoming. So one day I was playing games on my PC when I get a notification from my doorbell saying my doorbell was rung 4 times. I sigh and get up. Tim got up and ran to his hiding spot. I go to the door and answer it. 
OP: Hello?
EM: Hi there, can my son please have your cat. I will pay $20.00 for it
I was completely caught of guard by this comment but quickly responded
OP: No thank you
EM: Why, you’re like (looks me up and down) 9?
OP:  Um no, I am 14
EM *laughs* Okay, kid $20.00 is a lot for a kid your age so just give me the cat and I will be on my way.
OP No, thank you.
EM: Wow, you don’t have to be such an entitled brat about it
Now this next part is an assumption based off lip reading and facial expressions as the kid was NOT signing (the mom was)
EK: *screeching* Mommy, mommy can I have the kitty now
EM: Sorry sweetie not yet mommy is almost done  
OP: Like I said before no
EM: EK, go inside while we finish (she signed this)
OP: Uh Ma’m you can not give you child permission to go insi-
He ran inside anyways and I went after him grabbing the cat out of his arms and comforting him
EK: Mommmmy he hiiittttt meeee
OP: No, I didn’t, he forcefully grabbed my cat and I simply grabbed it ba-
EM- YoU hIT mY KiD yOU PeDOPhiLe. Now its time to compromise. You give us the cat and we will not call the police
OP: Ya, OK good luck lady
I then slam the door shut and go back to my PC. EM bangs on my door and rings the doorbell for a solid 5 minutes and then leaves.
I call the Non-emergency line for our police department (using a subtitle for calls app, my phone is loaded with deaf accessibility) and inform them of the situation and the nice lady gives contact info where I can send the videos (like said earlier I have cameras EVERYWHERE) and tells me she will handle it.

Important note: Dear everyone in the comments, yes I am American

Also, people in the comments, say it’s fake all you want. What do you want us to say, “Congratulations Sherlock you figured out the case” Not gonna happen, you think it is fake so what? Go live your life you have better things to do. Because if you don’t have better things to do, get a hobby. It’s more productive.
