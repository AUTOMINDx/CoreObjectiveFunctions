Does anyone else get anxious when receiving texts?
I know this probably sounds strange but if I wake up and see unread messages I feel slightly panicked/anxious. Even innocent "good morning" or "what you upto today?" texts (even from the right people) can make me a little on edge. I don't know if it's just me... Am I overly sensitive or private? Or perhaps this is more common than I think.

P.S. Those multiple texters really stress me out. I hate seeing like five messages which could have easily been one... Am I the only one?
