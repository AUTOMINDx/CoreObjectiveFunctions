When did it sink that you are really and truly an adult?
Some days it feels like I’ve always just been my age, and then others it’s as if I’m so old compared to the newer generations.

Edit: Thank you for my first award! These comments are so important. I’m trying to read every one! Thank you, I’ve learned a lot and being an adult is really about how you make it, feel it, &amp; experience it.
