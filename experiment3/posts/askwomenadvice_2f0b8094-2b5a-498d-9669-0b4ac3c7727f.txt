I want to see my friends succeed...but not at the same level as me. What's my issue?
Growing up, I was always jealous of friends who I perceived to be better than me (whether that be looks, skills, belongings, etc.). 

Now, as a young adult, I still find myself experiencing ill will against friends, but instead of being jealous of what they have, I get upset over their potential futures. I don't want them to be more successful than me. For instance, I'm going into a competitive field (medicine) and whenever I hear about a friend who is also pursuing medicine, I get anxious (even upset and angry?) and don't want them to succeed. I would rather they go thrive in tech or some other field.

Do I have a psychological problem, or will I grow out of this?
