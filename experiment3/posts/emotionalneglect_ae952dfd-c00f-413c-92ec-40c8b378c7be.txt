Is neglect abuse?
I read an article somewhere that said neglect is abuse. Does that mean my parents abused me as a kid? Its just something I've really been having to deal with. My parents took care of me. They fed me, clothed me. They did all the things parents should do. But.

I have so many problems and anxieties that can be so easily traced back to how they "delt" with me as a child. I never felt like they cared about me as a person. I grew up thinking my thoughts and wishes just...didn't matter. I'm just now, at 29, starting to heal. I just am dealing with the fact that...my parents abused me as a kid? I don't know...any thoughts?
