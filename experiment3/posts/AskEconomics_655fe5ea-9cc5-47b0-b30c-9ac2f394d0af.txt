In Catcher in the Rye (1951), it's mentioned that someone bought a fancy new Jaguar for $400. According to the BLS' CPI inflation calculator, that'd be about $4500 today. Why were cars so cheap back then/why are they so expensive now?
Just to be clear, I understand inflation -- but this looks like a change in the relative price of cars, not just the price level.
