Help ASAP! Covid positive, double vaxxed, 22F, oxygen 91
Hey guys! I am 22F with no pre-existing health conditions. Non-smoker (sometimes social vaper), take paroxetine and methylphenidate daily. Need some advice on what to do.. tested positive twice on at home tests yesterday following a severe sore throat, headaches, and the feeling of an elephant sitting on my back. Am I supposed to report this somewhere or go get actually tested (i don’t want to risk infecting others). I have been self-quarantined since I started experiencing symptoms. Just wondering now at which point I need to go to the ER. 

Background: generally very healthy, active, recently have had lower BP. I am away from family at college and don’t know if I am just freaking myself out or need to go see a medical professional - my PCP hasn’t replied yet. 

As of this morning I have had less of a sore throat but lost taste/smell. Cough is more frequent now &amp; occasionally coughing up green clumps (sign of infection?) Additionally, my blood oxygen was at 91 last I checked, but was at 97-99 last night. Saw a post that said if SpO dips into 80s to go to ER immediately which has me freaked out because that’s a broad range. I don’t think i have shortness of breath as i am not having to make an extremely conscious effort to breathe (not really sure on what constitutes SOB). Chills then sweats but no fever? or maybe my thermometer is f’d up? 

Anyways, anxiety is high. Please help, I have never felt so sick.
