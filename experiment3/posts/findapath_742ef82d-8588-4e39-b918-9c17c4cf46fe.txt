When you’re older and don’t care about the bullshit anymore
Did all the things. Got all the degrees and just don’t want to do another meeting. Don’t care about any company’s goals or mission. Just want to work from home, do something mindless and make decent money. Any ideas? 

Ppl post “side hustles” that are all scams.
