My parents marriage failed, my mom cheated on my dad, my dad never was present for my mom when she need him, my dad was never there in my life growing up and my mom is hypocritical and thinks it's okay to play the moral high ground with excuses thinking i don't know she cheated.
Yet they think i don't understand, know, or can't clearly see the visible cracks in our family. They fight, disagree a lot, and my mom treats my dad like shit now for treating her like shit before. And I'm caught up in the middle of it.

It's honestly annoying. When they try to act as if I'm some troubled teenager who'll ruin their reputation as if cheating can't do worse.
