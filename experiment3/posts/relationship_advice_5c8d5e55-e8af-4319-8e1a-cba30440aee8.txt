I (39M) found out few things about my younger self (2M) and can’t stop thinking about it
Please delete if not allowed here.
My (39M) mom passed away through suicide when I was 2 or 3 years old. The only memory I have from around that time is me sitting on the floor trying to wake her up. I always thought that I must have moved on pretty fast from her death. Today while talking to one of my aunt, she mentioned that she was taking  care of me after my mom passed away and for the 15 days when she was taking care of me, I used to cry a lot asking for my mom and then bite my aunt and pull her hair very often. The knowledge that I missed my mom a lot has broken me. I know this is stupid but all I can think about is that little boy who misses her mom so much and his pain (Very well knowing that that little boy is me). I just keep thinking that what if time is not linear and what if a part of me is still stuck in the past crying and waiting for my mom.

I very well know how stupid above sounds but I really need some advice to get past it.


EDIT UPDATE1: Thank you for all the kind words random strangers. I am going to make an appointment for therapy/EMDR as most of you have suggested. When I was typing the above, I really thought that most of you would have Reddit slapped me into reality by telling me I am being naive and I should get over it like a man and I would have been ok with that response too. However, here you all are being kind and guiding me towards therapy and self realization. Thank you so much. I don’t have words to express on how much you all are helping
