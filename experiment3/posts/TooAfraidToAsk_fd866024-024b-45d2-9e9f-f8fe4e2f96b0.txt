Why aren’t people afraid of the known long term effects of COVID but are afraid of unlikely/unknown long term effects of a vaccine?
Known Long term effects of covid include: trachoostomies, damage due to tube going down their throats, kidney failure, months of physical/occupational/speech therapy, pneumonia, blood stream infections, pressure ulcers, header failure, organ failure, brain fog and stroke-like symptoms

And for men: impotence. Forever limp :’(


Known Long term effects of vaccine are: immunity from the above…
But there are some short term effects such as thrombosis (blood clots) that happen rarely; HOWEVER, studies have shown that blood clots happen a lot more often in people that get the actual virus.
