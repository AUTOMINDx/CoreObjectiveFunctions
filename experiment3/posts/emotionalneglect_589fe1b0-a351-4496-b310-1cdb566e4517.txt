Is anyone else struggling with Christmas and how family centred it is?
I’m having a really difficult time coping with Christmas this year, everything reminds me of how much I don’t have a loving family , no home to go to, no mum or dad to spend the break with. The worst part is, they’re still alive, but I’ve had to cut contact with them to survive. 
I feel like I’m getting torn apart by grief every day that goes by, and nobody understands. I’m struggling to see the point in carrying on at all, with a life like this. Would love if someone is also struggling with the same thing and would want to talk about it. Or just be there for each other during this shitty time.
