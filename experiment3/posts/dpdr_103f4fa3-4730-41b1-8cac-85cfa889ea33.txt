Christmas sucks with dpdr
Watching everyone else enjoying themselves is really hard when everything is just foggy and awful for me. I can't take in any of the joy. It's supposed to be the happiest time of the year and what-not but I don't feel anything. 
This is, of course, made a million times worse by the fact that I've barely seen anyone in months due to covid lockdowns. I'm so fucking lonely. 
Anyone relate?
