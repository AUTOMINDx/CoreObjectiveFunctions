Is there a direct relationship between fat (adipose tissue) and fat (the food type)?
I understand that the body will produce adipose tissue when in a caloric surplus, and fat is quite caloric. But is there a more direct relationship between eating fats (butter, olive oil, avocados, etc) and producing adipose tissue?
