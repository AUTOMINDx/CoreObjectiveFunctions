How can cis men (and AMAB people in general) be better romantic partners to women?
There are a lot of men who are lousy romantic partners to women, either because they don't care enough about their partner's well-being, or because they have good intentions but weren't socialized to develop positive traits that are important for healthy romantic relationships. For men (and AMAB people in general) who are trying to be good romantic partners, what are some things they can work on?

From talking to friends and browsing forums on relationship advice, here are few things that come to mind:

\- Prioritize open communication without oversharing or pressuring her to overshare

\- Make things as equal in possible in terms of initiating things, planning dates, etc.

\- Split domestic chores as equally as possible

\- Share the "mental load" of emotional labor as equally as possibly (I found a great checklist about emotional labor [here](https://i.imgur.com/bLhhFTo.png))

Are there other things that anyone would add to the list? Also, does anyone have recommendations for books or articles on how to be a good romantic partner?
