An interesting idea I thought of during the Cosmology lesson in my Astronomy class.
Since matter cannot be created nor destroyed, then wouldn't that mean that the universe would have existed forever in some form? Like the big bang has happened multiple times but then the universe collapsed back into a single point and exploding again. In other words a universal recycling system.
The problem with this idea is the fact that dark matter exists which pushes outwards on the universe causing it to expand, which in turn allows for more dark energy which would stop the universe from collapsing because of gravity. So what if, the dark matter tears the universe apart then those pieces of the universe has such high mass that they collapse and cause their own big bangs making more universes there for making a multiverse.
I am no professional and don't understand everything that I should So none of this probably makes any sense.
