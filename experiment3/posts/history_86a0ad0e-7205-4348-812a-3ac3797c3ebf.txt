How did the Mongols navigate through the deserts and grasslands before GPS and accurate maps?
There would be nothing but vast grasslands and sands and the eagles and  vultures above them. Other than the sun and moon and stars there would  barely be any landmarks. How did they do it without maps and compasses  going to one city to another? 

I would think they would look at sun and star positions or they would have had some expert navigators along with them. They could have used compasses but I doubt they had this before they conquered the Chinese. 

What about days where it's rainy or cloudy. Would that throw them off? Did they get off course sometime and say end up in Afghanistan instead of Syria?
