Malagasy possessed wanderers
Hi all. Im sorry if this does not fit the forum, but...

A few years back I heard a story from a girl I knew that went to madagascar, and came back with some kind of horror story.  She stayed in this village where at night time some possessed wanderers would come and claw and knock on your doors. And if you opened or even acknowledged them being there, they would try their darndest to try and come in and there would be dire consequences. And she even told me that some of the locals warned her about this, and told her the "rules".  Apparently she even lived through one of these 'beings' knocking and clawing on her door.  My question for this forum is now : is there truth to this?  If so, do these "zombies" have names? I'd like to know more about this phenomenon, but sadly I've lost all contact with said girl and Google is no help at all. 

Thank you
