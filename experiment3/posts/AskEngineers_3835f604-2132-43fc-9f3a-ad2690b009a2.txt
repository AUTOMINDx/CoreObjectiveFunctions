I'll be a graduate of mechanical engineering in a year but I don't want it as a career. What should I do?
I'm a graduating student of mechanical engineering. I just chose this course because this is what my parents wanted. I know I should have told them that I don't want this course but the thing is that I don't really know what I want at that moment. Now, I still don't know the career that I want for my life but I think sales and marketing will be good for my skills.

What do you think I should do after college? Is there any work for a mechanical engineering graduate that I can put my skills into?

Please help me as I am very lost.

Edited:

Thank you for all your responses as they really helped me decide on what to do after finishing my degree. As of now, I'm thinking into entering sales engineering after finishing college and after a while, if I'm still interested with that career then I will get an MBA. But working as a mechanical engineer before changing career path is also a good decision.

Though I am also interested in coding so I think I might look into it.

Please continue dropping some more advice so I can have a wider perspective about this matter. Thank you so much!
