Therapists love metaphors
Metaphors can be used to share complex psychological concepts and theory, in a relatable way.

What are some metaphors your therapist has shared that stuck with you?

Disclaimer: not all therapists love metaphors and not all metaphors land right. Feel free to share the duds as well.
