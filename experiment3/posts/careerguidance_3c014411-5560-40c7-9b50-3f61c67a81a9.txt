Is it a bad idea to quit the office for a trade?
I need someone to be realistic with me.

I absolutely detest sitting on a train in silence to go and sit for 10 hours straight, staring at a computer. I work as an account manager in advertising, which pays okay, and could eventually pay quite well.

However, I have very romantic ideas about learning a trade (electrician most likely), working with my hands, on sites. Is it a terrible idea? Do most tradies wish they could have a cushy office job? I’ll have to take a large pay cut to work as an apprentice, is that silly? 

Has anyone made this switch before? 

P.S, I am 26, so I still have time to make a change. But, I am worried I will waste my Bachelor’s degree and 2-3 years experience.

Thank you in advance, as always, for the advice - Reddit is the best.
