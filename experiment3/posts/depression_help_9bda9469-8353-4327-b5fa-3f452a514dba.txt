He took my happiness away
To make a long story with a lot of red flags short, I am in a relationship with a married man. I knew he was married when I first got involved with him but he told the story a lot differently that made me think that he was in the process of moving out. He eventually did but that was only because his wife found out about me. Two years later here I am on the verge of suicide. He’s cheated on me with his ex wife, he’s cheated on me with women online , the list goes on. Why am I here you might ask? Well a month ago I gave birth to our son. My first child, his 3rd. I found out about some of the cheating a couple of weeks after my son was born and since then it’s like he’s sucked the joy out of my life. I’ve found that I have no patience for my newborn and at times become angry with my newborn and feel like I’m about to lose my shot with him. I have started to get really scary intrusive thoughts about my baby and myself. I feel like he’s taken the experience of a healthy relationship and the experience of a first time mom from me. I have literally hit my lowest point and I don’t know what to do. I know therapy is the first step but because our relationship is SOOOOOOO complex and he’s done sooooo much shit, I’m afraid if I open up that conversation I might harm myself.
