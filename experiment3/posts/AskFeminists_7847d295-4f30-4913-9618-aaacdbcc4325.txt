Are men inherently misogynistic?
Is this a stupid question? (if so, I’m sorry I’m still learning myself) Is it a part of the patriarchy?


Obviously it’s not all men, but I find it that I rarely (maybe never) encounter men who actively learn and practice feminism as allies. I’ve found myself distanced from men because I’m afraid of growing close to one only to end up being with a bigot. Many men are extremely defensive when female struggle is brought up and immediately start shunning the issue or make it about themselves. 

Curious on what others’ opinion is on this. Do you all know men in real life who actively practice feminism? Did you have to educate them? Or did they seek out feminism themselves?
