Does your significant other check out other people? If so, how do you react to that? 

I didn't like that the guy I am seeing did this, it made me feel as though I'm not enough. He told me that all men (attracted to women) check out other women. I (cis female, sexually attracted to men) never check out other people once I have committed to a relationship so this is hard for me to grasp. I was very disappointed and hurt to hear that all men are like this and so I asked a few guys that I am close with and got different responses. One said "guys can't help it", another refused to answer the question, and a third said he doesn't check out other women when he's in a relationship and then was accused of lying... 

I wanted to hear more from men and asked strangers on the internet. So far I have received similar responses. Basically that men can't help it and not to worry, then a comparison to a woman checking out shoes at a store but it doesn't mean she wants to buy all of them or the same as checking out a hot car but it doesn't mean the guy wants to buy it... This also upset me as I feel the one answer is stereotyping women and the other is comparing a woman to a car... Maybe I'm just sensitive or reading too much into it all.

Now I want to hear from women regardless of your sexual orientation. Is this normal? Do women check out other people while in a relationship? Am I reading too much into this? I never thought of myself as insecure but I guess I am because of this. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
