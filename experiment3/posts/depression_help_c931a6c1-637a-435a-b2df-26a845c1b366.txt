Future looking better but haunted by past mistakes
I can't stop thinking abut everything I messed up before it tears me up with some part of me still clinging to hope can change it

And when I see what people go through real traumatising stuff then I feel worse about myself as it's nothing compared

In short friends left my life and I just want to end it sometimes without them I can't get over it. Something I had to get through the dogshit years of 2020s now gone and I'm lost

Other parts of my life looking up but I keep looking back
