Realised my partner is unable or unwilling to give empathy at this time and it's not my fault
My parents were emotionally neglectful. Fast forward to adulthood, I'm in a 10+ year relationship. I know my partner is not "in touch" with emotions but he's affectionate, and I was willing to work on myself and grow, so I thought what we had was doable.

An ongoing tension we have is that when I open up emotionally, I'd like him to validate my emotions, rather than judge or advise. I've felt guilty over the years, as he's made it clear he doesn't want to do this and thinks is strange, weak, childish, or even a bit too "female".

I want to emphasise that I don't feel entitled for any one person to meet my needs; it's my responsibility alone. I've been working hard on myself, on non-violent communication, emotional literacy, support groups, making change in my life, etc.

We had a discussion about this recently and I took responsibility for myself, my needs, my emotions. I listened, as best I could, to understand. I explained specifically and gently what I'd like him to do - listen, understand, make active listening style comments, etc. I stayed present and calm.

I walked away from that conversation knowing that I really have come a long way and am proud of msyelf for that. It occurred to me, that what I was requesting was empathy. I was sort of stunned and floored. My partner does not know how to show empathy, doesn't value it, and doesn't want to learn how to share it. I realised, there is no-one in his life that he is close to - friend or family - who he supports emotionally.

I want to acknowledge to msyelf that I've taken so much blame onto myself for wanting and needing normal things over the years. Being "close" with someone who is either unwilling or unable to give normal human empathy has definitely had an impact on me, particularly in terms of self-esteem.

I am not trying to change him. I jsut realised, Iv'e done all I can. Up until now, I was able to take responsibility for the situation by say, "I didn't comunciate well", "I want something unrealistic", etc. Now I can honestly say, I want empathy, which is a normal thing and ok to want, and I expressed that as respectfully, specifically and kindly as anyone could hope to.

It's scary to acknowledge that I've come to the boundary of what I can do to make this relationship work and be emotionally intimate. I'm in no rush to change or go, I'm not demanding instant change or ultimatums from my partner. But I have to acknowledge to myself that I want and need more, and if there is not some gradual improvement over the next few years, I will need to consider leaving.

In the meantime, of course, I'll continue working on myself and enjoying my growth and healing.

Edit: Thank you so much for the responses everyone. Really, thank you. I'm relieved to know I'm not alone in this, although of course I'm sad that you guys are going through it too.

I've taken a while responding as I've been thinking about what I'm going to do next. This realisation is kind of a watershed moment for me. I'll be staying with my partner for a while longer - at least 6 months to 2 years, say - while I get my shit together (finances, emotions). It is possible he’ll learn empathise and I want to give him a fair chance, although I can’t control that of course. 

My partner is not bad or abusive. I think he’s shut off from his emotions because he witnessed his father and then stepfather abusing his mum as a child. Of course, that’s his stuff to deal with; I’ve never ever nagged him to get therapy or anything like that. I just think that’s the backstory here. Yes, his inability to show empathy has had an effect on my self-esteem. It's not as simple as saying it's worn me down; I never had much self-esteem in the first place. My parents were very emotionally abusive and neglectful and my self-image was dirt when we first met. I've actually grown in confidence and health since I've been with my partner, because of his really positive qualities of calm, affection, and stability. I'm grateful for that. But it doesn't mean I owe him more of my future if we aren’t a good fit anymore, though I did want to share it with him.

I'm not in a position where I can get up and leave tomorrow even if I wanted (which I don't this minute), because I have not taken full responsibility for my finances or career. Partly because I've been focusing on healing lately during lockdown, and partly because I've just been... I don't know, complacent in our relationship; codependent really - I guess I'm still scared to completely heal and take full responsibility for myself because that would look completely different to the life I've led so far; perhaps he's more comfortable with me remaining dependent because he knows I won't leave then, so he always says it's not a problem I pay less rent because he makes more, etc. I don't know exactly; but I know I'm not taking 100% responsibility for myself. And that's not fair on me, because I know I can do more, I want to do more and respect myself more, and it's not fair on him, because I'm letting myself lean on him financially and then I'm reluctant to insist on emotional support because I feel guilty and undeserving and then I feel resentful. So I need to get my sh\*t together. 

I'm being real here guys - go easy on me. I've been working away on myself and that's how I've had this realisation so far. I'm going to Coda and that's a huge help; I 'm going to work the steps. This thing now, this empathy conundrum, I can't unsee it.

I can already feel a change in me after writing this post and reading your responses. I realised, I can accept his limitations right now and still validate my needs and get them met elsewhere. It's a temporary measure of course - long term, I don't want to be with someone who can't show empathy. I'm so glad we don't have children at this time. I think that would be a lot of pressure on me to be the only emotional resource in the family for my kids, and to do it without emotional support from my partner - I'd be recreating my home growing up. But seeing the truth has taken the pressure off. I'm not demanding he see my point of view. I can stop coming to him upset and then feeling hurt and rejected when he can't deal. I can get myself in order and be more clear on what I'd like him to do, and accept a no gracefully if that's what he says. And just keep working on my healing and growth.

Thank you all again, so much.
