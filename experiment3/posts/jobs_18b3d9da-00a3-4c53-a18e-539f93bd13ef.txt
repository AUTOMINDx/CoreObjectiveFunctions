Am interviewing. I use a cane due to a medical condition. Got asked in a phone interview follow up if the cane is “just a temporary thing or permanent or…?”
Like, I know it’s the elephant in the room, but I straight up told someone about it during my interview and they still asked this.  I am still in the interview phase with them and I’m not sure if this question is inappropriate or just “oof.”  

My answer was a “Yes, but” and I offered the idea of me using a rollator at work instead.  A rollator is like a walker on wheels with a seat you can rest on.

I’m just feeling awkward and tired.  This is the 2nd time the cane’s become part of an interview in a bad way.  No discrimination when hiring my foot.

Sorry.  Just feeling a bit salty from all this rejection.  At least they called me back.  All the other applications I’ve sent out are just floating uselessly in the wind.  Sigh.  I really hope things get better soon.
