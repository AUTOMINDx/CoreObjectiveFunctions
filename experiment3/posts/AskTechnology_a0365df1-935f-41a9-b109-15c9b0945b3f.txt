Online Video Storage
I am an amateur videographer with 10-15 terabytes of footage, and more on the way. What is the best method for securely storing all of it like a backup? Most places Iâ€™ve seen online treat me like a corporation or something for wanting that much storage, and seem to charge an exorbitant amount for it. Thanks.
