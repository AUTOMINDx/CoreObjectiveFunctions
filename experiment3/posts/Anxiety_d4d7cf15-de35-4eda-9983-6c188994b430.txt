Do you ever turn off the internet because a person isn’t answering to the texts and it calms you down?
The subconscious idea in my head is that if the internet is turned off the person possibly already answered I just don’t see it. Basically the possibility calms me down and makes me worry less. Does anyone else do that? 

Especially if the situation is a highly stressful one I just can’t function without doing that.
