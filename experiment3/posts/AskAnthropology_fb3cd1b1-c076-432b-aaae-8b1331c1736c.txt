Do we have a theory of what propelled certain cultures to develop technologically while others are stagnant?
What I mean is that, let's say, Amazonian tribes, Australian aboriginals or some African hunter gatherers have lived roughly the same for thousands of years and I'd imagine they'd continue to do so if left alone.

But that makes me wonder, why didn't these cultures make the jump that the Mesopotamian civilisations or the Chinese in the Yellow river (among others) made? Is it random chance? Abundance of some resource? Weather?

Going back to the cultures I alluded to before, is it reasonable to expect them to remain mostly unchanged or would we expect them to eventually start their own bronze ages (again, if left alone, so in some hypothetical scenario where the other technologically advanced cultures didn't exist or didn't intervene in any way)?
