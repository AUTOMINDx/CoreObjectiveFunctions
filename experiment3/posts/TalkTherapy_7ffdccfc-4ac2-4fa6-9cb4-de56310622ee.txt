Just saw my T for the last time
I feel so sad. She went overtime by 30 minutes and only revealed at the end that this would be the last time we met. I don't know if I should be angry at her. I feel heartbroken. 

You go into therapy to heal your pain and ironically you end up with more pain. 

How do you get over this pain?
