Thank u
I just wanted to say thank you. Reading other people’s experiences with PTSD has really helped me deal with my own and feel less like I’m going crazy. It’s hard to be vulnerable and a lot of people are on here and a lot of people apologize for posting and I just wanted to say the things people post really are out here helping people even if it’s just your personal story. Sending love and healing.
