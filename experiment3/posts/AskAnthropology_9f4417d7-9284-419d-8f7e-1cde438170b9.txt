Were all/most/much the Native American political and ethnic structures that existed before the European colonization destroyed by diseases and what was the connection of the tribes later encountered(Iroquois, Lenape ect) to the pre Colombian tribes?
This question particularly pertains to prestate societies like woodlands Indians and plains Indians
