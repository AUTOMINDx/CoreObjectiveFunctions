Therapy feels like a scam
I am having a hard time thinking therapy isn't a complete scam. I saw my therapist for three years and I have no doubt she is 100% professional and competent as a T. 

However, in that time I became really dependent on her. She convinced me that we "had a connection" (she said that first) and that she cared about me (even though she knew I didn't want her to care about me). I told her many times I was uncomfortable with how dependent I was becoming but she made it seem like me being dependent on her was a good thing. 

Basically, I invested thousands of dollars (may tens of thousands) and so so so much of my time and emotional energy into this "relationship" that she encouraged and then it was just over, and my T didn't bat an eye because why would she? I'm just like any other patient. I'm left feeling like a piece of shit for believing she actually cared about *me*. I think she cared about the outcome (was I getting better or not) but not about me. If she cared about me she would not just cut me off like that. That's to make her life easier. 

I'm not saying she should do anything more, she should definitely cut me off because I was a horrible patient and she doesn't owe me anything more. I just wish she had refrained from telling me she cared in the first place, or encouraging that closeness. And if she had never said she cared, maybe I would have stopped seeing her on my own years ago. I put so much into therapy to get not much in the end, except sadness and a feeling of distrust in therapy.
