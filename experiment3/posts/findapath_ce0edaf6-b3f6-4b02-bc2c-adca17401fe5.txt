Is it really a bad idea to go into a career for the money?
As long as you work hard almost anybody can become adept at most jobs excluding maybe the more physically demanding ones. So why would it be bad if someone that was really passionate about, letâ€™s say,  pottery went into engineering. And if it is bad, what should this pottery loving person do? I keep hearing that you need to VERY passionate about the career you have in order to be happy.
