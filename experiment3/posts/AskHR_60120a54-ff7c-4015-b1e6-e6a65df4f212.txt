[PA] Company switching from bi-monthly to bi-weekly pay period. Says it causes hardship. Why?
Hi, 

My company is switching from pay every pay period of bi-monthly to a biweekly pay period.  They are now offering a PTO cash out of 30 hours to all full-time employees to provide an alternative to the shorter hours pay.  The maximum PTO accrual they offer is 224 hours and  I have about 190 hours of PTO saved up. I have no real plans for it so I probably will take the 30-hour payout. 

I just don't understand the purpose behind the payout. Could someone explain how switching from a bi-monthly pay period to a bi-weekly pay period, causes hardship on people?
