My wife of 5 years has told me that she has tried, and now she is tired of trying to take care of me.
It's not her fault.  It's mine.

I'm autistic, so it hasn't been very easy being married to me, I guess I didn't know how much that meant until we moved into separate rooms.

Her and our roommate are staying at a friend's house so they can relax without being around me after I broke down earlier today.  I'm in this big house with nobody here, and I feel so god damn alone.  And I deserve to be, she told me as much.

I don't really know what to do now.  I don't have anyone anymore.
