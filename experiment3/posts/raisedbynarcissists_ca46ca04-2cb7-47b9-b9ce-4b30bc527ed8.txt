My Christmas present is getting custody of my cat
When I left and went NC six months ago, I took my cat with me. Iâ€™ve had him since I was a kid, and heâ€™s been my absolute pebble ever since. 

I requested an ownership of microchip transfer a few weeks ago online, only for my Nmum to decline (my cat is registered in her name, since I was a kid when I got him).

I requested it again, and this time she completely ignored it.

However, what she *doesnâ€™t* know is that if the request is left ignored, ownership will automatically transfer to the person who requested it 25 days later.

Well, that was 25 days ago now, and in five hours (midnight on Christmas Eve, so technically Christmas!) my cat will legally be mine, and thereâ€™s nothing she can do about it.

Unless she has some sick, last minute game planned, this is going to be the best Christmas present ever.

Update: itâ€™s officially midnight, and officially Christmas! I checked the website and it says itâ€™s still pending, but Iâ€™m sure it just takes more than 30 seconds to process. Regardless, we made it until Christmas without my mother intervening!! 

Will update when heâ€™s officially in my name!!

Update: I GOT CUSTODY GUYS!! THE EMAIL CAME THROUGH THIS MORNING!! I posted an update to the thread, but if you miss it, hereâ€™s Buddy opening his Christmas presents this year ðŸ¥°
