How does buying expensive paintings etc. help with money laundering?
I have read about it in a lot of places and saw it in many TV shows and  movies. People will buy a painting for millions of dollars. Now, it is  much easier for them to move the painting than such a large amount of  cash. But the painting is still worthless if no one else agrees to pay  that much for it.
