I waited 9 months for a counteroffer promised at the end of the year. I did not get an additional annual raise -- should I ask for one?
I was going to quit my job in March but my company gave me a counteroffer (a $30k raise and partnership shares) with most of it provided at the end of the year, when we have our annual reviews and raises. At the time, I didn't realize how long I'd have to wait, and I was resentful that my company kind of tricked me.

My boss gave me my review without notice, so I didn't have time to be prepared. He told me I'd get what they promised me in March, plus a bonus, which I deserve after my exceptional performance this year. However, he did not give me an annual raise (of at least 2.5-3%) on top of the counteroffer raise. I think it's not fair, especially since I had to wait 9 months for the counteroffer raise.

I'm hesitant to ask for more and annoy my boss and his boss by being too greedy. During my review, my boss said I will have one of the highest salaries at my (small) company and that it reflects my value to the company. But I think my company is pretty cheap, and I could be earning more at a lot of other companies. And I worked really hard this year for nothing if all I got was a bonus a little larger than usual. The rest I deserved in March and should be separate from a raise, right? Or is it my fault for not clarifying that back in March?
