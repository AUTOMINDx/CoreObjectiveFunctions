Ghosted by a recommending professor in eleventh hour
I am totally new to this, so bear with me if I dont know what I am talking about.

About 7 months ago, I began by application process to graduate school.  I emailed around asking former professors if they would write me a letter of recommendation.  I secured one (so I thought) from a former professor of mine.  He had said in May that he would he happy to write me a rec as long as I used a medium like Interfolio, and I agreed and paid for the subscription.  Since then I have sent two or three reminders of my earliest deadline (today).

Flash forward to last week, I sent one final reminder to which he responded very quickly saying that he would get it in on Monday or Tuesday (two days ago and yesterday).  It came to yesterday at 4:30 PM and I emailed him again telling him that I was getting a bit nervous and asked if he'd still be able to get it in.  No response.  Now, today, the day of the deadline, I have emailed him again and even called him office.  Both of which have not been responded to.  I am panicking a little bit and don't know what to do.  I feel like I have been completely ghosted in the eleventh hour and am now left to scramble to find a recommendation before the end of the day.  


Anyone have any advice? Is this normal?  Am I the asshole?
