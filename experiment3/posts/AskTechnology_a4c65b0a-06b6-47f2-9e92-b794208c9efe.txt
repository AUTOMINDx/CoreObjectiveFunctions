Best TeamViewer alternative for remote support?
I'm looking to start a business with remote technical support as an option. 

Just noticed that teamviewer is like $60 a month billed annually so this isn't financially feasible for me.

If I was to use a teamviewer alternative such as anydesk, how exactly would this work in my situation?

Appreciate any help.
