From a past sufferer
I'll keep it concise. I had severe constant depersonalization and derealization for about a year around 2 years ago. I know it's hard around this time with speaking to family, travelling and trying to enjoy the festivities while suffering. Have a beer or a glass of your favourite drink. You may have been suffering for a week, year, 5 years or even more. The main point of this perceptive "disorder" is anxiety. Everyone dissociates. Everyone. It's completely natural. You're stuck a state of high anxiety and your brain is tired. Close your eyes for 5 seconds and when you reopen them try to act like you have zero knowledge of any of the stuff you know about "DPDR". This subreddit is not healthy. Take a break off work, go to your room if you're not feeling comfortable around family, put on your favorite show and try to relax. I know how difficult it is. Have a wonderful night.
