Why isn't the efficiency of solar panels increased with mirrors.
I'm essentially thinking of a system that takes light that otherwise would hit and transfers it to the panel. Would probably increase the efficiency given on a normal day it's probably not operating at it's peak with minimal costs. It's doesn't have to be a good mirror could probably even work with shiny foils
