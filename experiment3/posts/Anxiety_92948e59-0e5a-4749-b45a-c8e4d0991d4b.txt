Feeling really ridiculous when something you stressed about for days resolves itself in an instant
For example you discover you have to attend some event next week and spend days making yourself sick from anxiety and overthinking. The day before the event someone nonchalantly lets you know that the event got cancelled. The feeling afterwards is so so weird.

You’re of course extremely relieved because suddenly you don’t even have to think about this obstacle anymore. But then you realise how much you let the anxiety run your life for those few days and it’s quite deflating. You probably went through a million different scenarios in your head of what may happen at the event, all for no reason at all. I have to laugh about it otherwise I’ll cry lol.

Does this resonate with anyone? Every time it happens it’s like a huge banner waving in your face telling you to stop investing time and energy into things that don’t matter or may not even happen.
