No car in a small town, pretty broke and little motivation to go outside and not be alone.
I have friends I love and was doing school but that fell apart. Got medicated for adhd and that helps a bit too. But i just can’t leave the house. Feel like too big if a mess to see anyone. Zoom is fine. But I know it’s not the same. And feel like I forgot how to be with people. Feel like I want to stay in all the time. Have never had a working car for longer than a week. Haven’t left my house in maybe a month. Afraid to drive as well. Just wanted to say my piece. Feeling low and know I’m experiencing a strong want to stay inside. Wishing everyone well.
