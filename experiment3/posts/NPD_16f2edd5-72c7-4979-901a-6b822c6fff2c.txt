Can a narcissist feel true empathy?
Ok, let's say you see one being a sympathetic crier, for no reason, no audience, and even try to hide it.

Or say a narc watches a movie, it's incredibly sad, they are alone but they start tearing up.

Is there any reason for them to cry? Can they exist as humans? Or are they considered more empaths that still show narcissistic personalities?
