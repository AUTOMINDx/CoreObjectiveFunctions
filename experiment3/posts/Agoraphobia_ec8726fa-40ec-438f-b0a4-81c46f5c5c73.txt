Anxiety is a huge factor informing my agoraphobia, but I feel like depression is what's actually keeping me stuck at this point.
I'm incredibly afraid to go anywhere by myself, so much so that I never do, but I feel like the absolute #1 reason I'll probably never get better is because I'm mentally/emotionally trapped by this sense of crushing depression I've had for so many years now. It prevents me from seeing a way out of all this, and worse yet, it prevents me form building any momentum towards change. I really feel screwed at this point.
