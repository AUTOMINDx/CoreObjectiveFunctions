3 months is a long time to go without physical intimacy
I was watching a show and one of the characters said “3 months is a long time to go without physical intimacy” 

Well it’s been about 3 years for me and I already felt so pathetic and lonely. After all, I’m the man so I’ve got to make it all happen it seems. 
But I’ve been seriously hurt before. I’m no good at this. I feel I’ll just keep struggling.
