Does it always get worse before it gets better?
I started therapy a month or two ago and was promptly diagnosed with PTSD. We just started the proper treatment of it on Friday and I've been in such a funk since then. Really intense flashbacks all weekend. Today I've been a bit better, but I'm still feeling very easily triggered and really just exhausted. It's not even 6pm and I'm getting ready to go to bed.

My therapist warned me that I might be a little messed up on Friday. Should it be continuing this long? Does anyone know how to make it stop or at least settle down?
