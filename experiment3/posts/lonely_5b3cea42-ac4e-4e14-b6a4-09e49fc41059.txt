One of the worst parts of being single and having no one special to connect with is feeling I'm never allowed to talk about it.
I managed to drag myself through yet another Christmas alone without someone special to love and share these times with.  I turn 50 next month, and my hope is diminishing.  One of the worst parts of all this is feeling I'm not allowed to talk about it.  Everyone shuts me down if I try.  People can't help themselves.

"Others have it worse..."

"Get a dog..."

"Lower your standards..."

"Get yourself right first..."

"It happens when you stop looking..."

"You have to learn to love yourself..."

"Focus on yourself..."

"You should see a doctor..."

"You have to get out of your comfort zone..."

"You need to be more positive..."

And my personal favorite, if I say anything someone doesn't like... "and that's why you're alone."

I honestly wonder if the straw that broke the camel's back with a lot of people who suicide is that someone they reached out to for understanding only demoralized them.
