Can you have PTSD from mom dying from cancer?
All I hear about is about soldiers or rape victims. I never thought you could have PTSD from someone dying from illness. But it's been 7 months and it suddenly got worst. I had flashbacks/triggers in May/June, but then it dissapeared and I was grieving except occassional things reminding me of my mom. But I do have nightmares of her being sick - that's the part that affected me the most. I'm lately getting triggered by little things that remind me of her sickness and I even had to excuse myself from important things like classes to go cry/feel it all again. I'm not sure if it's how grief works or something else. I do have worst self-esteem, anxiety attacks over thought of my loved ones dying too and no goal for the future. I'm just not sure if it's all just grief related or something more. Anyone with similar situation?
