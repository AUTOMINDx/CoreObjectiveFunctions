How to get over feeling left out at company activities
I started a year ago, and ever since, I've stumbled upon plenty of parties in the conference room that I wasn't invited too. A couple of times, I had to stay there (after the party was already over) because I'd have to meet with one of the employees there. Never got offered anything. Not even scraps or just fucking water. One time, one of the managers talked to me, looked past me and offered the person behind me coffee and cake, then continued like nothing happened. I don't know, I just find it rude.

Well, today, as I was leaving, I couldn't find my boss and when I went into the conference room, there he was with all of the supervisors and managers (I am one too) that clocked in today on site, celebrating a christmas party with secret santa and food. Never got invited. Their faces were priceless when I walked in on all of them stuffing their faces in food and the whole room was full of gifts. A couple of jaws dropped, too. Pretty funny, not going to lie.

I feel horrible though. 

Besides these events, the culture is just very toxic and unorganized, so I've already decided to start looking for another job. 

Regardless, I feel terrible. I feel like the odd kid again being left out in school cliques. How do I get over this feeling of knowing that, no matter how respectful and friendly I've been this whole year, I'm simply not considered "part of the team", not even by own fucking boss?
