Does “real” learning have to be on your own?
I would really like to learn economics, but the problem is that I struggle with math. I can usually figure things out if I can collaborate with others, ask lots of questions etc.

The problem is that I’m basically almost failing my differential calculus course because the exams require you to apply concepts learned in class to new scenarios.

Do I just not understand math unless I’m able to apply such concepts to new situations totally isolated?

If so, maybe econ isn’t for me.
