The myth of traditional bushido | a brief annotated bibliography of reliable sources
I've seen the subject of bushido raised several times here, and I thought it might be useful to provide a brief annotated bibliography of reliable sources on this greatly misunderstood topic.

Oleg Benesch, “[Bushido: The Creation of a Martial Ethic in Late Meiji Japan](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0071589)” (University of British Columbia, 2011).

This PhD thesis is a groundbreaking examination and synthesis of historical and scholarly sources, demonstrating that bushido as popularly understood has little grounding in historical reality. Benesch cites and quotes extensively from Japanese texts and commentary to build his case, proving that the so-called "way of the samurai" had no substantial existence prior to the Meiji Restoration of the nineteenth century, and was largely the creation of two different Japanese writers; the Japanese Chrsitian Inazo Nitobe, and the xenophobic nationalist Inoue Tetsujirō. Benesch explains how  Inoue Tetsujirō's view of bushiodo became widely accepted within the Japanese government, and was mythologized and militarized in order to justify Japan's re-awakened desire for imperial conquest.

&gt;The popular view holds that bushido was a centuries-old code of behavior rooted in the historical samurai class and transmitted into the modern period, where it was a fundamental component of Japanese militarism before 1945. In fact, the concept of bushido was largely unknown before the last decade of the nineteenth century, and was widely disseminated only after 1900, especially after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5. This study argues that modern bushido discourse began in the 1880s, and was dependent on political and cultural currents relating to Japan’s modernization and the nation’s attempts to redefine itself in the face of foreign “others,” primarily China and the West.

Oleg Benesch, *Inventing the Way of the Samurai: Nationalism, Internationalism, and Bushido in Modern Japan*, First edition., The Past &amp; Present Book Series (Oxford, England ; New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2014).

This is the formal academic work incorporating the text of Benesch's original thesis, together with additional information and illustrations. An enthusiastic review of Benesch's book characterized it as "[not only a classical work in Japanese history, but also one I would heartily recommend to anyone interested in the history of Japanese philosophy](https://philarchive.org/archive/KASROI)".

Antony Cummins, *Samurai and Ninja: The Real Story Behind the Japanese Warrior Myth That Shatters the Bushido Mystique* (Tuttle Publishing, 2016).

An excellent in-depth treatment of the authentic history of the samurai and ninja, citing extensively from Japanese sources to provide an accurate understanding of these military roles. Cummins demonstrates how the history and character of the samurai and ninja have been commonly misunderstood in Western pop culture, and restores their true image with the use of historical sources. The work uses Japanese terminology extensively, but Cummins has ensured its readability by using parallel English translations.

Two aspects of this work may be disappointing for the dedicated researcher. Firstly, since Cummins is aiming primarily at correcting modern Western misconceptions, he does not address the historical distortion of bushido by the Japanese themselves, especially during the Edo and Meiji periods. Secondly, although he alludes to and  quotes historical sources extensively, he almost never names them; footnotes are few and far between, and even long quotations are typically not accompanied with identified sources. There is also no bibliography, although in chapters such as "Samurai and Shinobi Literature" and "Concerning Shinobi no Mono", he does identify the historical texts, such as martial manuals, which he has used as sources.

&gt;The history of the samurai and the ninja has previously followed two paths; the academic and the fantastical. Both have been rolled together to form a complex mess of half-truths. An extreme and impressive level of historical detail has been studied, yet forged with hearsay and romanticism. Therefore, this book has two simple aims: make that which is complex easy, and in doing so, eradicate that which is false.

Aya Francisco, “[Bushido: Way of Total Bullshit](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/bushido/),” *Tofugu*, 8 December 2014.

A very accessible popular level treatment of the subject, in non-scholarly language, drawing on a range of sources cited in a reference list at the end of the article. Heavily reliant on Benesch, this is an excellent overview of the bushido myth from its origin within the writings of Inazo Nitobe to its weaponization by the Meiji government, and its influence on Japanese military behavior in the First and Second World Wars. This article focuses primarily on Nitobe's bushido myth and how it was received in the West, without touching on the influential Meiji era contributors to the militarization of bushido, such as Inoue Tetsujirō.

&gt;Nitobe's astounding lack of references to Japanese history and literature add weight to this argument. *Bushido: The Soul of Japan* remains curiously void of factual backing, becoming a vehicle for Nitobe's equivocal ramble and yearning for an imaginary past.

Karl F. Friday, “[Bushidó or Bull? A Medieval Historian’s Perspective on the Imperial Army and the Japanese Warrior Tradition](https://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/Bushido_or_Bull.html),” *The History Teacher* 27.3 (1994): 339–43.

A detailed and well referenced scholarly paper on the subject, studying the interaction between the mythologized and militarized bushido of the Meiji era, and the behavior of Japanese armed forces in the first half of the twentieth century. Most importantly, Friday challenges the widespread idea that Japanese military atrocities and war crimes are directly attributable to either a traditional bushido ethic or to the bushido invented and weaponized during the Meiji era. Friday surveys medieval Japanese sources, the Meiji characterization of bushido, and the Japanese Imperial Army's own codes of conduct and instructions to its soldiers, in order to reach his conclusion.

&gt;To sum up then, the military tradition of the medieval samurai has very little in common with the "*bushidó*" that was current in the early twentieth century, and does very little to explain the behavior of the Japanese Imperial Army. Far better clues to the attitudes of the Japanese high command, the officer corps, and the ordinary troops can be found in the specific circumstances of the war, the political atmosphere – both domestic and international – of the 1930s, and the process through which Japan emerged as a modern nation.

Karl F. Friday, *Samurai, Warfare and the State in Early Medieval Japan* (Psychology Press, 2004).

In this work Friday confines his research to the Japanese military from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries. This work is primarily a secondary source, providing an excellent collection and analysis of information on the equipment, tactics, and ethics of individual samurai as well as the general battlefield strategy of military leaders.

Arranged chronologically, the book's contents describe how the Japanese military developed over the centuries, as well as how their relationship with both political elites and commoners changed in response to various social forces. Although intended as a historical resource rather than as a debunking or mythbusting work, it nevertheless serves as an extremely useful corrective to romantic and mythologized views of the samurai and bushido in Japanese history.

Friday's book has been described by one reviewer as "[an excellent treatment of a hot topic](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/186078/summary)".

&gt;Contemporary aficionados classify Japanese swords as tachi, katana, wakizashi and tantō, but this is an entirely modern typology, designed for evaluating swords and sword furniture as art objects rather than as weapons. The term “tantō,” for example, written with a pair of characters that mean “short sword,” is now a technical description applied to blades less than one shaku (approximately 30 cm) long, but during the Heian period the same compound was read “nodachi,” and indicated any sort of smallish sword or long knife. Similarly, “wakizashi,” which modern sword collectors use to designate intermediate-length blades (between one and two shaku), was originally an abbreviation of “wakizashi no katana” (“sword thrust at one’s side”), and applied to companion swords of any length.
