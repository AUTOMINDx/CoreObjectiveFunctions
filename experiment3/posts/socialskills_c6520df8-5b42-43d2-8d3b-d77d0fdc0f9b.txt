And you wonder why your conversation lasts only 60 seconds?
It's about listening and understanding what the person say. More likely you didn't show interest in what the other person is interested in. 


Imagine you're super passionate about gardening/gaming, and a conversation went like this.

        Them: what do you like doing?

         You: I love gardening(or gaming).

         Them: Cool! How was your weekend btw.


From that brief chat, you know they are not interested in gardening. You may feel passionate to talk about it, **like a missile launching in the sky, but their disinterest shoots your missile down**, and you hold your tongue because you don't want to bore them.

**Are you doing that to other people** when having a conversation? When people share a piece of information that they find interesting, do you mark it as uninteresting/boring in your mind and try to quickly move on to another topic? If you do that, the other person will feel a lack of connection.

## Watch out for a **tester**. 
A tester is a short sentence that people share to test your interest. They can **talk more about it but they don't** (i.e. I would love to dye my hair red or I bike over the weekend). People won't talk more about it or elaborate unless you **show interest**. 

If you move on to another topic too quickly without showing interest or understanding of their interest, **you're taking away their opportunity to talk about things they care about**. If that happens, it doesn't matter how many questions you ask to keep the conversation going, it will get dry and boring for the other person quickly.
