Trying to understand empathy and sympathy
This last year I turned 30 and have gone down a rabbit hole of self awareness which is annoying and during this time I realized I may lack empathy for others. I caught myself having to remember to make a sad face if someone shares a sad thought with me. I know I’m supposed to feel sad for them and say something supportive in return but it isn’t genuine.
