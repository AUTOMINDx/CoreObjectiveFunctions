I tried to kill myself today and my dog stopped me.
She tried to climb up on the chair with me as I was about to hang, when I climbed off she rubbed up against me sat down infront of me and looked at me with a very concerned confused expression. I felt so much guilt in that moment that I cried for the first time in months and I couldn't stop I cried until I puked and just layed on the floor then she brought me her ball and sat down next to me.

I know she doesn't know what's happening how can she she's just a dog, but I know she actually loves me and I know a few people do too even though I'm such a fucking loser. I feel like such a piece of shit that im going to abandon my companion and my family that have only ever been amazing to me. But I just can't find the will to keep going for them everything is just too much I can't bare being awake anymore all I do is just hope for time to pass so I can sleep. I'm always sick probably from all the stress, I can't eat anymore without gagging. My life is just fucking miserable and it feels basically impossible to change it.
