I’ve reached a level beyond numb
I keep having delusions that my wife is being unfaithful, and it’s put a serious toll on our marriage. I’m 25, and still have to live with my parents because they make my wife and I pay 700 dollars a month to live here. I’m stuck, and I’m worried I’m not gonna live long enough to see my boy grow up. I try to “fake it till you make it”, but there’s nothing there anymore. Everyone says things will get better one day, but one day hasn’t came since I was 13. Now one day, I know I’m going to hang myself from my balcony
