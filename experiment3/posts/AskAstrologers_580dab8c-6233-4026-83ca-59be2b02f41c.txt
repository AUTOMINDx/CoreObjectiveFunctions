Unpopular opinion- most of the Retrograde "warnings" are just fear mongering for clout.
Retrogrades are a good time to stop, rethink, revisit, reread, and think extra carefully before proceeding. They are NOT a time to put your entire life on hold because some Tiktok astrologer said so. This goes for all retrogrades but right now I am specifically speaking on Venus, as that is the one we are in. 

If you meet someone you think is special during this time, go for it. Maybe take things a bit slower than you normally would. 

If you are in an established relationship, don't cancel your wedding because it happens to be during a Venus retrograde. Especially if it was planned before the retrograde. Maybe think twice about a spontaneous elopement. 

If you need a haircut, get the damn haircut. Maybe think extra hard if that unique (to you) style is REALLY what you want. 

To add some personal context, Venus Rx have always gone incredibly well for me. I was not born with a natal Venus Rx but my fiancÃ¨ was. During the Venus rx in 2017 was when we said our first "I love yous". During the Venus rx in 2020 was when we got engaged. Now this Venus Rx I am spending recovering from a nose job that was completed in the shadow period. I'm obsessed with how it came out (yes, I'm a Cap rising, so this retrograde is happening in my first house, how fitting). Oh, and I have a hair appt for January 8th ðŸ˜‚

And if you wanna doubt me because of my age or whatever my grandparents who were married nearly 50 years up until my grandpa died, married under a Venus Rx. They had one of the most beautiful relationships I ever witnessed. 

Rethink and go slow. Do not put your life on hold.
