Any good book recommendations on inflation/deflation or hyperinflation?
The concept of inflation is a fascinating one, and one I feel I understand less and less the harder I think about it. I've noticed a lot of inflation related questions and posts on reddit in the last year (for obvious reasons) and I'd like to read something that explores the concept in depth and with nuance.

Thanks!
