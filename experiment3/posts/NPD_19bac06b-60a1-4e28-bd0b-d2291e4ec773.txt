How to continue with this relationship? Advice?
I have recently gotten my official diagnosis for NPD and while it somehow is relieving, therapy has given me a lot to think about. 

My therapist and I have recently specifically discussed my current relationships and it has forced me to really think about my relationship with my partner. I had really convinced myself I genuinely cared and loved this person. Our relationship is pretty stable, we communicate well etc. I has been the healthiest relationship I’ve been in so far.

However, taking a deeper look at what I value about him makes me realise I just wanted to prove to myself I could have a healthy and happy relationship- like other people do. And how I enjoy feeling needed by someone. My boyfriend is emotionally quite dependent on me and because of that he lets some of my manipulative traits and laziness in doing chores slide. 

It makes me frustrated because I want to love like other people do. I see it- but it seems so out of reach for me. Like I can’t really comprehend what it is like to see someone and genuinely feel joy when something good has happened to them. Or genuinely value them as a person. 

Whenever I ask about his day I just don’t genuinely care, I just pretend. I have doubts about our future, for more reasons than just the fact that I don’t love him. I’m scared he’ll find out how I truly feel and I’m scared of being alone.

And even in all this I feel more ashamed and I’m wallowing is self-pity more than I think about his feelings in all of this. 

I don’t know what to do. I know I sound extremely selfish. But the realisation has made me very upset and I feel embarrassed and like a failure.
Is it possible to develop the ability to love others? 
What do I do? Can any of you relate?
