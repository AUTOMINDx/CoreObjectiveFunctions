Why are sexist characters on television always written to be charismatic !
The ones that immediately approach to mind are Joey from Friends and Barney from How I Met Your Mother, as they have‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­a tendency to objectify female characters on their shows and lie to women when pursuing sex. I notice how popular these characters are among their fanbases because they're seen as "cool", but I see them as problematic especially considering that these shows are PG and can leave an impression on young boys. Is it a byproduct of what the writers aspire to be, is it a type of character that male audiences find entertaining, or something else?
