What is the average day like for an engineer?
This question is mainly for mechanical engineers, but any other engineers are free to answer as well if they‚Äôd like to.

When I imagine engineering I think of; 50% sitting down and doing hardcore calculus, 30% tinkering around in CAD programs, and the other 20% doing meetings etc. Is this way of thinking accurate? (I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs probably not).

And one more question. I know that most engineers nowadays use CAD programs to simulate and design stuff. How much of your projects/designs are just simply up to your creativity?, and how much of the design is based off of the math and stuff beforehand?

Any feedback would be appreciated.üëç
