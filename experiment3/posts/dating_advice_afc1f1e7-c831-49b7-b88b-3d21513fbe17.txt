would you date a camgirl?
i’d like to add, as a cammer i am curious as to what people think of dating one, since there seems to be confusion. 

say she works for a few hours 4-5 days a week, pulls in a good amount of money, she’s loving and passionate (i'm adding this to the post because some people expect cammers to act otherwise, which is a rude stereotype) and just ur regular girl. 

at the end of the day, it’s a job for her. would you date her, or pass?
