Depressed because of the situation in Ukraine
Hi, I'm not stranger to depression but I know how to handle  it a lot of the time and I haven't had the need for a psychiatrist for multiple years by now. However the current situation in Ukraine is making me very anxious and depressed. I usually would be able to get my head out of this headspace but because it is something that could literally erupt next month is driving my mind in circles and I cant help but seek out news of what is going on. When I don't and just ignore the situation doesn't help me either as I just create worse scenarios  then I would if I know the facts. I have some family that lives there and that just makes it worse even if I don't know them very well.
