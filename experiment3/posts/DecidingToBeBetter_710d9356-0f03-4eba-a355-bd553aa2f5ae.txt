I have a serious jealousy case
Watching my friends and cousins who I grew up with get their life together made me feel green with envy. Some landed on a great internships/jobs while I hadn't got a single call from all the positions I applied to, one had found their SO, etc. 

I know this is not right, to the point where I have to deactivate my 1st instagram account and muting people's snapgram stories that made my mental down. My parent is not helping either, she always compare me to my cousin. I want to use this strong emotions as a fuel to achieve my goals but it just made me.. Sad and hopeless. How do y'all adults handle this? I hate feeling this way..
