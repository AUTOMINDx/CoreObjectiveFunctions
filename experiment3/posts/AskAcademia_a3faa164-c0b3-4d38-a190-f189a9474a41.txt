Request for article (not sure if appropriate!)
Hi all,

I'm not sure this is appropriate for this community. I've reached a crucial point in a systematic review I am doing with my partner and the last, last, last article we need for wrapping this thing up is inaccessible across 5 university libraries. So frustrating and right before all the libraries shut down for Christmas!!!!

In the spirit of Christmas, would anyone be able to kindly access this paper and PM me the full-text?

Clinical usefulness of amitriptyline in fibromyalgia: the results of 23 N-of-1 randomized controlled trials ( [Clinical usefulness of amitriptyline in fibromyalgia: the results of 23 N-of-1 randomized controlled trials - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1856813/) )

Edit: it's a key review for my partner and I am really keen to help her progress this work

Thanks
