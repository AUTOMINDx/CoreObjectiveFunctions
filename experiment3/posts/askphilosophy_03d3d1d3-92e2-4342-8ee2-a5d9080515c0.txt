Death of God, redemption through Art - Wagner, Nietzsche
Hello,

I was wondering if anyone would know any resources, books, articles, on the idea of Human redemption through Art, I heard was a bond Nietzsche had with Wagner.

The outline of what I think it is is as follows:

Religion is no more -&gt; Humans need some spiritual or transcendent (?) meaning -&gt; Art can provide it

Thank you in advance for your help.
