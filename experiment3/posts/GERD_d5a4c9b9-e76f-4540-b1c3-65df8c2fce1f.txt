1 Week Post Partial Fundoplication
After 5 years of suffering from GERD, I elected to have surgery to not have to take medication on a daily basis due to being so young. After tons of research and consultation with my surgeon, I decided on a robotically assisted partial fundoplication because it has identical efficacy to the full wrap with less negative side effects. 

The surgery was quick and painless, i had only minor trouble swollowing due to swelling, but now that is rapidly improving. Honestly the worst part about the recovery is being on a liquid diet and dealing with the food cravings.

I have had zero acid reflux since my procedure and have not had to take any medicine. Theres a lot of negative posts on here about surgery but honestly its very skewed to the minority of people who have a bad outcome. Most people who have had succes (~90%) dont come back to update that all is well.
