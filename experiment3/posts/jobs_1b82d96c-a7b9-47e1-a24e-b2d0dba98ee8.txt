Dear Reddit, what's the worst Christmas bonus you've been given?
As it is this time of year, I think we're all curious as to what your company has offered as a thank's for these current times.

For me, after working overtime starting at 5AM and ending at 6PM consistently during the start of the pandemic, mine was a 4 pack of Stella. 

What about yourselves?
