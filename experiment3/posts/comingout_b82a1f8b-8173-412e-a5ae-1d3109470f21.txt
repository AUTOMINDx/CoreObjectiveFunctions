can i come out here?
im lesbian. i like girls.

it took a really long time for me to go in circles to find out because i kept forcing myself to look at guys,, it's hard to come out to my friends right now because i've said i'm bi for so long and i'm scared they'll judge me for being fickle. i can't tell my parents for my whole life or i might be killed.

sorry, just wanted to tell someone instead of keeping it to myself.
