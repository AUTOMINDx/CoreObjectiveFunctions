Which Tablet works best for me ? Under 350 Usd if possible
I have a brand new pc desktop that I use as  my primary and as well as 2015 mac book pro 

but I started back School in September and I feel a Tablet would help alot of quick notes and if I need to draw my images for school ( Data Scientist Major) 

I use will my laptop to code . All  I need is a good open source tablet for Basic browsing , Note taking and maybe zoom calls .

Heard the Samsung s 6 lite is good option, Any Recommendations ?
