Any studies and information about Proto-Afroasiatic peoples?
Has there been any studies conducted on the Proto-Afroasiatic peoples? By reconstructing their culture, way of life, myths/religion, etc. Like how they did with Proto-Indo-European peoples. 

And if any one of you are knowledgeable, tell me everything about Proto-Afroasiatic peoples. By collating everything you know about them. Thanks
