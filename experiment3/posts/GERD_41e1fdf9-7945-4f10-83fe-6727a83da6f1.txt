I just want to cry
I’m 22 and have been dealing with gerd and fructose intolerance for about 2 years now. Before this I could eat anything with no issues, but after a bout of extreme stress from working overtime accompanied by lots of energy drinks and panic attacks my stomach feels like it’s destroyed. 

I go through phases of minimal symptoms to full blown “I can’t even drink water without acid shot putting itself up my esophagus.” I went to a GI doctor at the beginning and had an endoscopy that came back clear, and he had no clue what to tell me.

I’ve been doing my best to eat low fodmap for about a year and a half but it’s extremely difficult because of my poor impulse control and poor support system. I haven’t had more than a few nights without pain or panic attacks in so long.. I just want sleep. 

Sometimes I wish I could starve myself long enough for things to heal even though I know that’s not a solution. I just feel trapped in my body. 

Is this my forever? I can’t live like this for the rest of my life. I hate food. I just want to feel normal again.
