I (25F) don’t know which job to choose.
I’ll try to make this concise, as there are a lot of elements that can be confusing! 

Right now, I work at an after-school program from 2:00-6:00pm M-F at $19 an hour. These are not enough hours for me (20 a week), so I found a position that goes from 8:00am-12:30pm M-F at $20 an hour. 

Currently, we are very short staffed at my work, so the environment has been tense ever since I asked for a raise to stay. They offered to pay me $21 an hour, but on a ‘conditional’ basis, which means it could go back down to $19 an hour at any time. 

Today, I had an orientation for a full time (8 hour) position as a preschool teacher at $24 an hour. It comes with health and dental benefits. 

The only drawbacks: the commute is 40 minutes one way, and I’m not a fan of working with very young children. 

But, at this position I’ll be making 2.5x the amount I am right now, which will help me save up and pay for an out-of-pocket masters program I’m interested in. 

What should I do?
