Do people not realize how rude it is to point out to someone how “shy and quiet” they are?
This is one “of many” reasons why holidays and large get-togethers are difficult.

I (24f) have always been shy, and being homeschooled for most of my life didn’t help my lack of social skills but nonetheless I have still improved significantly. One thing that has still remained, and will probably always remain, is being quiet and reserved, particularly in group settings. However, it’s a trait I’ve learned to appreciate about myself. I rather like the fact that I listen attentively more than I speak.

Today I spent Christmas with my boyfriends relatives; and even though they were welcoming and friendly, I still got my fair share of “well, you’re a quiet one, aren’t you?” Comments and “aw, why is she being so shy?” comments to my boyfriend. I know they mean well, but I also think that pointing out someone’s shyness, especially in a group, is still incredibly rude- especially if it’s addressed in a negative light.

And you know what? For us shy &amp; quiet people at the party:
Sometimes we just want to exist quietly. Sometimes we just want to be present. Sometimes we’re thinking about something in our head. Sometimes we want to listen to other people speak and their stories. Sometimes we don’t have anything to say in the moment, but are still enjoying ourselves. You don’t constantly have to fill the space with noise.
Just because someone is introverted, quiet, or shy does not mean they are always upset, anxious and boring. 
And if they are being quiet and shy because they’re anxious, don’t you think addressing it in front of a group is a little inappropriate?

Apologies for the rant.
