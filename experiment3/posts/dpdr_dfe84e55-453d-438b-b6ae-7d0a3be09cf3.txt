Ever just wish you could meet someone else in person with dpdr?
I often find myself trying to imagine the experience of meeting someone else with dpdr. I’ve had the condition for 7 years starting from the age of 12. At this point the dissociation is the only real thing that I know.For me it never goes away. The thing that has always bothered me about it is the inability to acknowledge it. You tell anyone about it they either think that your crazy or something is wrong with you and that you should see a doctor. There was a long period in my life where I didn’t know there was something off with my perception of things. That initial experience of dpdr didn’t feel like I’d gone insane it just felt like just realized something for first. Felt like I just noticed something that I hadn’t notice before. The fact that I exist and the reality of that existence. For years I just thought that was normal experience like realizing that your going to die one day. It wasn’t until a couple of years I mentioned it to someone mentioned that’s not normal that I became aware of the abnormality. But even before that had always felt it odd that anyone could take anything seriously with that reality hanging over you as well as the fact no one really brought it up. It just became painfully obvious at that point that no one else could see. I began to remember what I use to experience and just how drastically different it been.

This reality is bizarre. And can’t acknowledge that. My persona isn’t me but im seen as that. Im no one. I want to meet someone else with dpdr because I just want someone to see for who I am which is nothing. I always have the feeling of just emerging into existence for the first time. My memories aren’t connected to me. They weren’t experienced by me. I just want to meet someone with that exact experience
