[Zombies] Why do zombies never attack each other?
Whether they're victims of a virus that puts them in a permanent state of rage, mindless, shuffling corpses with no instinct other than to walk and eat, or reduced to an animal state that is sort of halfway between the two, zombies never, ever attack one another. They always go for the uninfected. Why? What instinct survives through blind rage or mindless numbness that allows them to recognize in-group and  out-group?
