What is your first memory that uncovered the emotional neglect for you?
The mind is a tricky thing and often we do not remember the neglect, simply because we normalized it.

A repeated memory i have is that my mom and dad often went out for a night in the town, usually well into the morning hours, and often i was dragged along as a young boy.

I remember the first two hours where always fun, but then i would get tired around 9 pm of course as any 3 to 7 year old would. And often i just lay down on a selfimprovised bed made of 2 chairs or bar stools, trying to get some rest in a loud pub filled with smoke and drunk people. I wasn't really looked after all that time, and if i expressed i wanted to go home and sleep, i got a bag of chips to keep me quiet for another hour. Those where gruelling nights, waiting hours and hours, mostly alone and unsupervised.

I also remember how when we got finally home by 4 or 5 a.m., atleast one of the parents usually had to throw up or was miserable, making me feel the only "adult" in the house.

It is not a memory that screams "abuse", but all the typical elements of neglect are there... especially if you consider its was not a one time thing, but more the rule. And that most of my childhood carries a similar feeling as those nights.
