Soldiers doing mundane tasks for a bigger cause that they aren't aware of
I heard about a soldier that was told to watch a dial and to turn a valve when it hit 100 or something and he was told after the war that he was refining uranium for the atomic bomb. Is there any more resources for this type of stuff happening? Not restricted to just the Manhattan project, other situations like this are welcome. Thanks!
