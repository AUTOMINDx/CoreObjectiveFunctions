Divorce, alone, and life crashing around me
My husband and I aren’t doing good. We’ve only been together for 2 1/2 years but we aren’t going to make it. We are both young, I’m 20 and he’s 22. We have both agreed we need to split up. He has a support system and his family is well off so they can help him through it. I have nothing, and no one to help me. Not even a shoulder to lean on. I have my two dogs. My credit is already wrecked because I fucked up with my credit card awhile ago. I have 2 big dogs that I’m scared I won’t be able to take care of when we split. I can’t lose my dogs, they’re  all I got, and they’re very attached to me. I love them more than anything. I won’t have a car that runs good, and I will be homeless. I’m scared I won’t even be able to afford my medication anymore. I don’t know what to do. I’m so lost, I have no one to guide me. Not even my parents. Is life supposed to be this bad? What should I do? Are there any options of help for me until I get things sorted out????
