I came out. I don't know how to feel
So, now my parents know I'm gay. It was a really hard moment, but at some level, they ended up accepting this. I don't know how to feel because they said they are not going to mention the subject anymore. I really don't mind if anyone else knows, I was just interested in letting my parents know. But I feel like they are going to just bury the subject and live with it deep inside. I'm really lost because they took it so hard at first and now it feels like they will ignore it as if it didn't exist. Should I talk to them a bit more or just let them be? I'm single right now, so I'm not going to introduce anyone to them... should I even introduce my partner if I have one eventually?
