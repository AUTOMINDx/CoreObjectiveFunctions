Can you recommend any Euhemeristic modern authors, ala James George Frazer?
Frazer's [Euhemeristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euhemerism) method in *The Golden Bough* can be spotty, but the fact that he posited real-life origins of myths, calendars, temples, rituals, taboos, dragons, priesthoods, and much more provides a fresh lens to look at our own recent history. How would Frazer have analyzed the cult of Mao Ze Dong? The Third Reich? Would he have drawn parallels between Chinese Confucianism and communist hero-worship? Prussian folklore lending to Nazi architecture? Who knows... At any rate, the real question is: is there anyone today who analyzes events through this (mostly) apolitical, Euhemeristic lens, like Frazer did?
