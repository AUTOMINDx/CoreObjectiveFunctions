Just got my Computer Science degree but realized that I immensely hate sedentary jobs. What are my options?
Just got my BS in Computer Science with a GPA of 3.7, but realized along the way that I hated being sedentary and rather do something more physically active, or at least without so much sitting. I only finished the degree because I wanted to:

1. I finish what I start

2. it's not a bad degree to have, especially with my low amount of student loan

3. I wanted to be taught how to think and problem solve in a certain way that programming teaches you to

The idea of applying for a software developer job is making me resentful the more I think about it. What other job options do I have with this degree? I heard of the "your college major doesn't matter" but what would that look like for a person with a CS degree?
