[Spoilers][Spiderman: No Way Home] What happened to...?
"A Film By Peter Parker".

During Spiderman: Homecoming, Peter Parker basically films all his interactions with Tony Stark and Happy and The Avengers, pretty solidly 'outing' him as Spiderman, so does that film still exist? 

Also all the text messages he sent to Happy? Is Happy one day going to check his phone and see a bunch of text messages from someone he's never met before?
