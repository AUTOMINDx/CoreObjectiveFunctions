Update: My (22f) bf (24m) knew I was a dancer before we started dating but now he uses it against me
I plan on breaking up with him when I move in January, and I think he's catching on b/c he's been asking all sorts of questions. I've been (falsely) reassuring him. I usually would just be honest and break things off now but we're still living together and I know he would react. I'm kinda walking on eggshells here b/c he's starting to drink more. I'm positive he started drinking b/c I've been avoiding him and making excuses not to be at home. And the reason I've been avoiding him is b/c I'm always anxious about how he'll react when I come home. I broke down and told him that exactly and he only got mad saying "how are you more afraid of coming home than going out shaking your ass for random mfs" like yeah shouldn't that tell you something?

In the past month he's escalated to hiding my fav stilettos/lingerie to the point I had to start bringing my shit to work (where it would 100% go missing, which is why I kept everything at home), took my house key off my keys and locked me out, flushed my birth control &amp; makeup, threw my money out the window, and he started choking during sex &amp; tried getting me to do anal. It's been leaving me in a depressive spiral I'm just tired of being sexually assaulted period it's like my body is only desired by r*pists. So yeah rant is over, I want advice on how I should break things off the safest way. I made my own lil escape plan but the only problem is with packing. I've been slowly moving my things to storage over the weeks but not too much so he's alarmed.
