Are You a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)?
Apologies if subject has already been covered here. 

A few years ago I became aware of HSPs, and realized I was one, and several people I know also. I think it sheds some light on how anxiety sufferers struggle with certain stimulating situations. It's sort of a superpower but with some disadvantages. About 20 percent of all people naturally have a nervous system that's more sensitive to stimulation than others. Light, noise, crowds. Too much stimulation leads to mental overwhelm, which takes time to recover, and recovery usually means solitude and quiet. It's a positive, affirming way to think about yourself. Something we all need. What do you think?
