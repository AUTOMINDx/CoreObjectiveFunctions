In hospital for second suicide attempt this month
I tried to kill myself today but I ended up waking up again. Freaked out because the gas I was using to suffocate myself was staying in my lungs but I didn't think it would actually kill me, just cause brain damage. So I called the ambulance.

I just got out of hospital like last week from my last suicide attempt, and now I'm back. I hate my life so fucking much. My sleep and pain (among other issues) make it impossible for me to work or study. Which is all i want. I just want a fucking job instead of lying in bed all day every day doing fucking nothing but crying about how shit my life is. I hate existing. If my doctors actually listened and did something about these problems, I would be able to have a life. But they don't.

I wish it wasn't so difficult to just kill myself. I hate living like this. There's no point in existing if existence is pain. 

There's no point to this post. I just don't have anyone I can talk to.
