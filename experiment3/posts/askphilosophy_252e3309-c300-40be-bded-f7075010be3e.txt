Philosophers on Max Stirner?
I read The Rebel by Camus a bit back and saw his line on Stirner, "...when all of them have gone your way, humanity will be buried, and on its tomb I, sole master of myself at last, I, heir to all the human race, will shout with laughter.‚Äù And so, among the ruins of the world, the desolate laughter of the individual-king illustrates the last victory of the spirit of rebellion. But at this extremity nothing else is possible but death or resurrection. Stirner, and with him all the nihilist rebels, rush to the utmost limits, drunk with destruction." I know Peter Kropotkin critiqued him because he was too self absorbed (Arguably at least, could also have an interpretation that kropotkin also was simply mistaking the rejection of morals and rejection of empathy but thats my argument)   


Made me curious, what other philosophers have written about Stirner?
