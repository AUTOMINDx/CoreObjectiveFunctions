Family trouble
My husband and I Live in a tiny three bedroom trailer with our two kids Three years old boy and one year old baby girl. I go school for cosmetology and my husband works at Tyson we love to try to help our family but lately it’s been getting hard.
Recently my brother and his wife was there four kids lost their house so me and my husband decided to take them in (bad idea) It’s been almost 1years now sense they moved it. The kids are so rude and mean to my kids. They don’t clean, The room looks like a hoarder room, cook they don’t even work. My brother plays games all day and his wife sit on her phone all day. 
Some times they will just leave me or my husband with the kids an not say anything to us. If I Kick them out they have nowhere to go. 

Asking for help what do I do???????
