I went for a run today for the first time ever
And I didnt pass out, puke or anything! I had to stop and start a few times but I managed to make it all the way round the local lakes and back to my house in 35 minutes. I genuinely thought I might drop dead but I pushed through and nailed it. My legs are sore as hell but im glad for it!
