Question: Does anybody remember the picture of an old west gunslinger?
A while ago, as in, some time ago, I saw a post here of a photograph from the early or later 1800’s of a young gunslinger from the old west. He had a wild look in his eyes and I remember counting up to 10 pistols holstered throughout his body- for ease of not having to reload.(EDIT HERE FOR CLARITY) 
I was so captivated in thinking of what his life would have been like for him to consider that behaviour reasonable at the time, let alone a way to make ends meet… or means to and end…

Anyway if anyone remembers or has other examples I am eager to hear!
Cheers!
