Friends son is being sexually suggestive, what do I do?
I recently moved back to my hometown and got back in contact with an old friend of mine who still lives there. We helped each other out a lot over the last year and they kind of became a second family for me. 

She’s a single mom with two kids, the one of concern being 13. Over the past few months when I’ve visited he’s been more and more sexually suggestive towards me. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or not. He checks me out A LOT and sometimes even makes faces. It’s definitely unnerving especially due to his age. Recently it even looked like he put something in his pants.

I brought it up to my friend and she said she would talk to him about respecting boundaries but it doesn’t seem to have done much. I’m at a loss as to what to do. I only know how to deal with the young ones, like my toddler. I have no clue how to deal with teens…
