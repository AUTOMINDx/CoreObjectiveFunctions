I just can’t cope anymore.
Every day I am disappearing more and more.
The last two months have been a living hell.
I need to go to the hospital.
I’ve been advised to go to the hospital by every doctor I’ve seen or spoken to.
But I can’t leave my kids.
We have nobody.

Parts of the day I have to set timers to get through just five minutes.
The pain I’m in is literally tearing apart my entire soul.

We are at rock bottom.
Me and my kids , who don’t deserve this. 
They deserve a better life. And I can’t give them anything better than barely making it each day.
I’m desperate to find help and I wish there was a break in the pain and discomfort.
I’m terrified . Christmas is coming and I have nothing for them yet because I can’t even leave my home on my own.
I can tell they know things are going to be sad. 
I don’t want to be alive anymore. 
I can’t take it.
I need help , and there is no help available to us.
I feel like we are worthless.

Please just pray for us.

I’d give anything for a hug.
I’d give anything for help.
I’d give anything for one single day they could feel happy and not scared for me .
Please take the pain away.
