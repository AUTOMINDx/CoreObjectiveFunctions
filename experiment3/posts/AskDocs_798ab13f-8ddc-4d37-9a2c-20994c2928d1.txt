What does it mean when a psychiatrist says you have "mild retardation"?
I had a paper fom when I saw a psychiatrist that I was told to give to my family doctor, and under either symptoms or diagnosis (I dont have the paper in possession right now) it said "mild retardation". What does that mean? I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and bipolar II, so was the doctor saying the mild retardation was seen because of my disorders? I'm confused about this because i have never struggled in college or in educational settings and just wondering if what this doctor wrote actually applies to me.
