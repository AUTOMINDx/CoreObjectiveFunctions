Why was us dollar decreasing in value when it was backed by gold?
Why was us dollar decreasing in value when it was backed by gold? Shouldn't it stay the same or even increase its value? But when you look at this [chart](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Purchasing-Power-of-the-U.S.-Dollar-1000x600.jpg) you can clearly see the value of us dollar is always declining. After Nixon abandoned the gold standard I understand it because it is backed by nothing, but why was it decreasing when it was backed by gold?
