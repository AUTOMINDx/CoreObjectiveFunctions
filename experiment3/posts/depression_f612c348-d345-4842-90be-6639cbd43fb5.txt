My friend killed herself
My friend killed herself about 2 months ago it’s Christmas today and also the 1 year anniversary of my grandma’s funeral these were the two women the defined me I’m depressed somedays it feels like its taken over me. I want to end it all just like my friend did as much as it all hurts I get why she did it. It’s a burden thats just to much understanding why someone would want to do something like that she was my best friend my soulmate I loved her so much but me I’m tired tired like she was, but I see the hurt shes left behind the regrets her parents feel the confusion her siblings re going thru and me being the only one to understand and not have the words to describe sucks! I wish I had the courage she had to end it all! I feel like my brain is a cluster fuck of emotions I don’t feel right and don’t know if I ever will.
