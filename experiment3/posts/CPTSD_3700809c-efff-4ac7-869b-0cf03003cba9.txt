Trying to fill the hole in my chest with parasocial relationships and maladaptive daydreaming
Anyone else do this? I've always been a daydreamer. There have been times in my life where my fantasy felt more real then real life. I try to compensate for my loneliness and inability to connect with others. I also tend to do this with YouTubers, bandmembers or other content creators I like. When I feel like someone is kind or comforting I will have a version of them in my head and talk to them or fantasize about them comforting me or being my friend. It always feels kinda pathetic, but I can't stop doing it
