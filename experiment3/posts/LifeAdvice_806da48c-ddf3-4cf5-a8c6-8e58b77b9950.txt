I feel like it's the end of the road mentally?
I'm 23 years old, going on 24 next year. And I feel like it's all over for me. Like I've reached my peak and can't go any higher. I honestly feel like I've been through like 3 lifetimes and I'm like 50 something now, on my 4th.

I tend to look at other peoples accomplishments and I tell myself that you could have done the same if not better, but it's too late for you, you're 23.    


I've been through a lot, and I've experienced things throughout my life that I probably shouldn't have. So I guess that's given me a lot of experience and some wisdom that I don't think I'd wish for.  


I didn't live a normal childhood either apart from it being an extremely competitive one with my siblings.   


I've been told since I was young that I'm going to be someone big one day and for the most part, I believed it. But these last few years, it's just felt like a plateau where I'm just "surviving" instead of living.   


I felt like I have a purpose before working on projects that I enjoyed but I doubt it all now.
