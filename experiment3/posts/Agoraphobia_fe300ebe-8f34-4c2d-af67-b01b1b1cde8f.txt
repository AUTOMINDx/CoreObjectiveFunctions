Vaccination status?
I haven't gotten a vaccine for covid yet. And I know I should, I don't want to get people sick and I don't want to get covid whilst unvaccinated. I haven't got one yet though, I haven't gone outside since before the vaccine was available. Like at all, before that I only went outside to get groceries as I was living in a different area and couldn't get groceries delivered. I haven't gone outside since I could just remain at home. Am I the only one or are there others like me? I know my family will want to see me at christmas and expect me to be vaccinated but I'm not. I'm not avoiding getting a vaccine because I'm anti-Vaxx I'm fully pro vaccine but I just can't pull myself to get outside and book an appointment if I have to anymore. Going out after being inside for months even if it's just to go visit family seems like a mountain to cross let alone going somewhere new.
