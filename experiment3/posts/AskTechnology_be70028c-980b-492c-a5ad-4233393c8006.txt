I'm watching my concert DVD's on my PC on a 4k TV.
I'm surprised that VLC is capable to play my old DVD with decent quality, it seems to be 720p/1080i on my sony bravia 4k 50 inch TV.

Genesis when in Rome

Peter Gabriel Growing up

I'm using VLC on windows 11, connected to the TV with HDMI. In my old PC or laptop used to have very bad quality even in the 27 inch monitor.
