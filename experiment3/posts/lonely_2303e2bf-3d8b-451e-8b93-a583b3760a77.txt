People don’t want to be your friend if you have no friends
Because apparently that means there’s something wrong with you. I’ve admitted to people before that I don’t have any friends, and while they don’t seem surprised, they didn’t offer up friendship and promptly quit talking to me.

How am I supposed to make friends if everyone wants to be friends with only those who have plenty already? I’m a good person, I’m funny, I’m cool I think. I think people casting me aside are shallow, but apparently most humans think this way.
