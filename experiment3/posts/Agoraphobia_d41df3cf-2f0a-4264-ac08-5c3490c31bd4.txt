i had my first shift at my first job
it was super difficult. It’s as a cashier/ customer assistant in a little shop near my house, and as a shy and very anxious person talking to people was so hard. I lived by the saying of fake it till you make it. I pretended i was acting a role of a confident person and i did get through the day without any disasters. 

I did have a bit of a panic attack but i quickly went to the back and managed to mask it and calm down slightly.

I feel super depressed and exhausted after this and i feel like the anxiety is never ending. But i spoke to my therapist and she said i’m making progress because before i was at home doing nothing and depressed and exhausted, whereas now i go to work and go on walks and am depressed and exhausted.

Hope all of your weeks so far were okay! &lt;3
