Can I have some recommendations on Documentaries/Books about indigenous life and history
Hello guys! An average curious person here. I am very interested in the history and life in different places. But rarely see indigenous groups being represented in history books. As a Brazilian, I had the opportunity to be immersed a little bit more in the history of the indigenous people of South America and I find it extremely intriguing. So I've been wondering if you guys can recommend me some material on peoples of different regions. 

I am already seeing a lot of stuff on native Americans, so it is a plus if you know from other places. But I am also open to more recommendations on the matter.

Ps: Already seem the recommended list
