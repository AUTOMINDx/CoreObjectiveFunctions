During the Cold War John F Kennedy received two puppies from the Soviet Union that were decedents of Strelka, one the first creatures to enter earth's orbit and come back alive. One of those dogs later had puppies with another White House dog. Do they have any known descendants?
Of the sources I found they usually just say that these "pupniks" were given away to other dignitaries, is there any information from what happened past that?
