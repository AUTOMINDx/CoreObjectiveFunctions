Progress is progress no matter how small
At 19 I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years, picked up moderate alcoholism as a coping mechanism, entered an abusive and manipulative new relationship, and began to seriously self destruct.

At almost 25, I stopped drinking almost entirely. I wasnt ever “that” bad compared to some stories I’ve heard, but I was drunk driving and I thank whatever power there is above I didn’t go out like my uncle or take an innocent life with my carelessness.    
I got diagnoses. And I’m taking meds for them. And I’m seeing doctors. Repeatedly. Showing up to appointments, making goals, keeping promises.    
I have my own apartment again. Sure I have roommates, but they’re my best friends. I couldn’t ask for better ones. I’m paying bills. I’m keeping food in my house.     
I’m showering regularly enough I don’t itch from the dirt caked onto my skin. I’m brushing my teeth at least 5 times a week - and I know. That’s disgusting. But 5 years ago? I was lucky if I brushed 5 times a month. I’m looking for a new dentist.    
I’m taking care of my physical health. I got my birth control renewed.   
I’m seeing someone who is genuinely a good guy. Cares about me. Wants to see me happy just so I can be happy. Doesn’t use my disorders as a fun way to manipulate me.    
I’ve kept a job for almost 5 months now.    
I adopted a kitten.     

I’m finally healing. I’m starting to get better.

And id be absolutely lying if I didn’t admit that this is the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. Most days I don’t see a point. Most days I don’t want to wake up. I’m upset that I did. Most days I still have to talk myself into a task for an hour even though it could be finished in five minutes if I would just start the task. 

But I’m doing it. And if spite is the only thing keeping me alive then I guess it’s good enough for now.
