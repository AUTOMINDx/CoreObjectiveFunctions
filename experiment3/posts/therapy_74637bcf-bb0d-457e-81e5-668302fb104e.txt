If I'm only going to therapy to appease people in my life how can I make it less miserable?
I hate every second of the sessions but I can't just not go because my marriage is on the line. I resent being there, I feel like I'm being attacked, it's awful. But I can't just not go so I do it. How do I make it less miserable?
