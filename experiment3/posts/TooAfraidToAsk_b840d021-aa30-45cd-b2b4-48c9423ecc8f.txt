Is "you guys" considered offensive nowadays?
I recently got an alert from work saying the term "you guys" is inherently gendered and other terms should be used. (It was addressed to everyone, not just me.)

I like being gender inclusive, but I'm also in my 30s, so I've been saying "you guys" since forever. I've never once meant it as "you group of men," it's meant as a way to address any group.

A lot of my lady friends and I call each other "dude" or "bro" - is this gonna be considered offensive too?

I guess I'm just not a huge fan of policing language, especially if it's not intended in a negative way. But I also get the idea that it's weird we can call a group "you guys" whereas "you ladies" when there's men in the group wouldn't fly.

Just wanted to hear people's thoughts on this, thanks!
