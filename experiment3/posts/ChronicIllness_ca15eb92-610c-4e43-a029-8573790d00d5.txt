Does anyone ever feel like you have to "tell" your body to stand up, move, sit, sleep?
Kind of a weird random thought, hard to explain but does anyone ever feel like this? When i stand up from a Chair I feel like I have to tell myself "ok body move forward." Before I got ill with long covid and a car accident, getting up from a chair was simple.
