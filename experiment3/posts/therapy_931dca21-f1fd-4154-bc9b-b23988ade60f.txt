I am so tired of having to study to be a normal functioning human being
I feel like it's so unfair that there are people out there that just make friends, find good partners and have fun without having to try so hard. Everything for me is such a big process, a big deal. 
Want to have friends? Keep your people pleasing on a leash so they don't use you but also try to be vulnerable and work your emotions, remember everything you've been working on. Want a relationship? Even worse. All that but also try to remember all red flags to not let your trauma choose a shitty partner because you want to relieve it to try to fix what happened when you were a child. 
Everything's like an assignment I have to complete while having in mind so many things so I don't wreck myself. I just want to live things without having to do all that just so I'm not a hazard to my own mental health. I want nice things too.

Edit: If anyone need clarification, the main point of my post is not about feeling sorry for myself and not doing anything about it. It's exactly the opposite: the hardships of working on my mental health and feeling at a disadvantage having to learn all this stuff about being a healthy human being as an adult!
