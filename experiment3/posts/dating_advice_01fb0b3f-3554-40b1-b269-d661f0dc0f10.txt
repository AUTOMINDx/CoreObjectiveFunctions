Was really interested in this guy I met online until he asked if my mom was hot…
And then proceeded to tell me his fantasy is being caught by my mom and then she becomes jealous and wants to seduce him too or “share him.” 

First gut reaction is to run the hell away. What do you guys think? Is this normal for guys to think about? Or is he just being overly honest in expressing it?
