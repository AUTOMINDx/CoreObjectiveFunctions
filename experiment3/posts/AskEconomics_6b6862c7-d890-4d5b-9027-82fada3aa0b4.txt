What would happen if all taxation was on gross revenue
I am wondering what would be the consequences if the tax system was changed to have a single, progressive tax on gross income/revenue for both individuals and companies replacing any income and corporate taxes (but not taxes that exist to steer behavior, like taxes on tobacco or carbon etc). 

(So: no deductions at all, you just look at the total income/revenue made in a year and apply a progressive tax table, the same for individuals and companies.) 

Would this not make taxation a lot more transparent and essentially remove the ability to minimize taxes by artificially optimizing book profits?

Or would there be other consequences that I am overlooking?

Thank you,
