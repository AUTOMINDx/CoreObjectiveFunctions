Therapist suggested going to every other week, I called later sobbing.
Basically the title. My therapist feels I'm stable enough to go to every other week. They told me this at the very end of the session. I said Okay! Like it wasn't a big deal, then proceeded to walk calmly to my car, and just start sobbing uncontrollably. 

I tried to stop crying and I couldn't, I thought if I started driving it would help, and I ran a stop sign and got cussed out, of course. And I texted my therapist asking if I could call him and he said yes.

I have never ever cried in front of my therapist, and I've been seeing him for over a year and a half. I called him sobbing telling him I felt rejected, he reassured me, and he wondered when he said it in session if it would trigger my BPD. I calmed down quickly on the phone, but now I'm thinking of self harm and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to face him again.
