How to handle this? New “Job” moved up start date
So I got offered a contract job, which I’m on the fence about taking since I think contract is a ridiculous expectation in this market.

FRIDAY: I was asked to start dec 20. 

I told the guy at the contracting company that starting after the new year would be better for me. He said he would talk to the client. (This is not a vertical that has major activity around the holidays)

He then called me back and said that no they wanted me to start even earlier.

I said that that would not be possible due to a couple different commitments that I cannot move.

He said he would talk to the client and work it out.

Today, my son showed me a box that was delivered to me yesterday. He thought it was Christmas toys.

It contained a (poorly packaged) laptop and a note saying they look forward to seeing me tomorrow.

I… am scheduled to speak at a deposition tomorrow &amp; am booked for a minor surgical procedure later this week. A family road trip the day after Christmas. Between 12/17 and 1/3 I have ZERO childcare. 

Im super frustrated that nobody is fucking listening to me or respecting boundaries that I set. Shit like this is why I was hesitant about another contract role.

Also nobody’s run any sort of background check, drug screen, tax forms, or I9 verification on me.

How do I proceed with these people?
