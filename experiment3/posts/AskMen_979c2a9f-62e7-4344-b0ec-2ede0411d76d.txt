What’s the best way to respond to, “I have a boyfriend” if you were just being friendly or asking a question?
Doesn’t happen to me a lot, but when it does I just stand there and stare at them confused.  What’s the best way to respond if you weren’t flirting or you were just sending the, “what’s the homework” text?

Edit: wow I didn’t expect this to get so popular lmao, thanks everyone!
