I think I'm irreparably broken
Mentally, and physically, since I'm also physically disabled. Me functioning at my absolute best is never enough. I can't even escape into sleep because I'll just have nightmare after nightmare. People expect me to function like a fully capable human and I don't know how to explain to them that I'm not anymore; there's not enough gold on earth to kintsugi away these cracks. I don't know how to do this anymore. I'm just terrified and depressed and anxious all the time, and I know I'm probably exhausting to have to be around, so I just try to shut up and disappear into the background as much as possible. Then I say something weird or flinch at something dumb and everyone feels bad. I'll so tired of trying to act like a normal human everyday. I feel like an alien in a human suit trying to fit in on earth. Thanks for letting me rant
