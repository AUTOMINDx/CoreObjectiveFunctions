Why is it that even now, people still wear their masks below their nose or chin indoors?
2-ish years into a pandemic, you’d think people have figured out how to properly wear a mask. I’m trying to figure out if it’s silent protest/defiance, some type of need to control, stupidity, poor mask fit, or genuine user error. Why wear the mask at all then?

Edit: Interesting mix of responses, seems like it’s definitely a mix of forgetfulness, poor mask fit, defiance, ignorance, stupidity, and for comfort.

Edit 2: Also, this is a genuine question. Like I understand people don’t commit murder because they’re just bad people, it’s more complex. Not comparing this to murder, but then again.

Edit 3: Surprising amount is apparently due to glasses fogging. I wear glasses. Has not been an issue.

Edit 4: My thoughts on masks and vaccines. Both are an important form of scientifically-proven harm reduction, but neither alone are the sole answer. A lot of “masks don’t work” and “science has proven masks don’t work” comments (though clearly people do not know how to properly wear a mask and/or don’t care), but that’s to be expected. Just stay safe out there, people. Try not to infect others or your loved ones.
