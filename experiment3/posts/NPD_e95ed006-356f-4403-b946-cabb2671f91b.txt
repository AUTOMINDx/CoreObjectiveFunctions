I got banned from /r/domesticviolence because I have posted here.
I don't have an NPD dx, but even if I do have NPD, that doesn't make me an abuser by default. I worry all the time that I won't be like my family. I firmly believe that no matter what, nothing justifies hitting a child and I'm against violence all together. 

I try my best to be better than the people who've raised me. Not in an NPD way, just as a person. 

So my father choked me two days ago, I resubmitted the post and the mods viewed my post history. Boom, ban.

I might have traits or even covertN, but I am not violent. If I get too envious or shallow, I kinda hate myself. 

But in the end, I'm a misanthrope. Whatever PD I have gained due to the abuse. People suck, humanity as well, I'm no better. It's easy to be on your high horse and ban me cause of three letters. Not talking to me, deciding for me. Double standards and gate-keeping? That's just fucking ugly.
