Women’s Weight matter?
I want y’alls honest opinion men. Do guys care about weight? Do guys find chubby girls attractive and dateable?

Edit: I’ve read most of your reply’s and came to the conclusion that it DOES MATTER for the most part. Thanks guys for your honest input on my question I had!
Most people are saying don’t care about the number more of how the appearance looks. Gotta have the junk in the right places basically (curvy)
Also y’all are saying your rather her be in good health so fun physical activities can be done and it shows self care.
And if your obese it’s a Big No unless someone has a fetish for it. 

Did not expect this to blow up over night, once again thank you everyone for your input! Y’all have been a great help of seeing the perspective of men on chubby girls attractiveness and if their dateable!
