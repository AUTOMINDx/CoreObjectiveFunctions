Guys who don’t like going down on a woman? What’s the reason?
Notice a lot of males on the internet are expressing how they want a woman to give them fellatio but refuse to please the woman back. (It’s not all of them so please don’t think I’m saying this) but it’s coming up more and more so now I’m just curious what’s changed over time or has it always been this way?
