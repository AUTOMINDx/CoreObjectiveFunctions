My BF grounded his teenager for being disrespectful but that also means the kid can't go to work.
This happened some time ago but is still rubbing me the wrong way. His kid is a hard worker and it is a positive environment for him. My bf grounded him last month after a disrespectful altercation but also told him he wasn't allowed to go to work. I don't think this kiddo missed even 1 day in the 1.5 years he had been at his job!!! I just don't even know how to process this and it has put a rift in our relationship.

\*\*EDIT\*\* His son approached me about it and said he is sick of how his dad treats him and he can't wait to move out. Yes, this is why he is working so hard, to save money. I will be saying something to my bf later tonight. I am a mother myself and I am am done witnessing this abuse towards his kids! They are all terrified of him.

\*\*EDIT 2\*\*   The kid was upset about being bullied at school and his dad pretty much told him that that is just the way it is sometimes, wasn't showing any support. He got angry and said "kiss my ass" and walked away.
