[Superman] Does Kal-El have to think about how much strength he uses when giving high fives?
So, does he operate on a God level strength and always have to tiptoe around? 

Or does he feel like a man (besides being impervious)  and exerts godly strength as applicable?

OR

Does he have an even better increased awareness of his strength so everything seems natural - high fives and lifting asteroids?
