Update: hit a home run, from the moment I walked in I could feel the sexual tension. We sat on the couch talking for hours while casually sipping red wine the whole time we were touching on eachother, she insisted I stay the night. We made our way to the bedroom and she excused herself to go get more wine. She came back to the room with the bottle wearing nothing but a thong. The sex was amazing and she really knew what she was doing with her mouth. We went for a couple of rounds and then chatted until we decided to sleep, during our conversation I complimented her head game and told her that usually I don't enjoy receiving oral (as I get off more from giving) and said that she was one of the few that got me really enjoying it. She asked if It'd be okay if she could taste me in the morning as a way to get me up. I woke up to morning head and then we messed around a few more times. We had breakfast and then i had to leave to start my day. We're seeing eachother again next week.
