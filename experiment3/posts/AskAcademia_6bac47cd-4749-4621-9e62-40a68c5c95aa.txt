Fellow academics: how do you deal with traumatic subjects in research?
I have taken up a research project at the moment which is very traumatising, and very relevant to contemporary political events around the world (women and race) which makes it all the more worrying. I find myself getting burnt out and exhausted very easily, and I find I am slowly becoming less productive after a very productive start.

How do you deal with traumatic subjects in research, especially when that work takes up majority of your day?
