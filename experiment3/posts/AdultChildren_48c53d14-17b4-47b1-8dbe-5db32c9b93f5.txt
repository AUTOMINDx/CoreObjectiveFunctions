Am I the asshole?
We sat down to watch a family Christmas movie, which all my life, my dad has used as his personal pass out time. His drunken induced slumber comes with lots of snoring. I told him to get up and go to bed to which everyone acted like I was being a heartless bitch. I don’t want to listen to him snore his heart out because of drinking while watching a movie. My mom even defended him and said he wasn’t even drunk. I’m so over it. I’m tired of being seen as the jerk or putting up with the shit. There’s no in between.
