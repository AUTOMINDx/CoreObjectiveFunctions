Loss of intelligence/memory from isolation
Does anyone else notice a severe decline in cognition as a direct result of years of isolation? My short term memory is poor, I feel scattered and need lists/charts to keep me organised. In conversation I struggle to think of what to say, and most of the time I feel like I'm just floating through the day without really taking anything in. I feel incapable.

Ive been recovering and functioning (it would seem) in the world for nearly 2 years now. I'm very much struggling with anxiety and a huge part of it is coming from this feeling of being incapable as a person.

I just wanted to be a normal person so badly.
