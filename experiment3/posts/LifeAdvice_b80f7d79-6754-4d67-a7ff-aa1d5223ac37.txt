how do I move to a completely different city on my own?
so I live in the Midwest and frankly I've never really been a fan of it and I've always wanted to move away to a different city 

and I think for the most part I could practically do it, but I have no idea how to get a job in a completely different state beforehand

if I was going for bigger more proper jobs then sure I could probably figure that out, but for right now I would be getting more or less entry level jobs (I have some managerial experience so it wouldn't be completely bottom of the barrel but still) so I'm not sure if there are any places that would really be open to out of state people that are just moving there 

*any other tips for this kind of thing would be nice but this is the main big thing
