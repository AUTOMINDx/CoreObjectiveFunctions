Why do public school lunches seem so much worse in the US vs other countries?
I stumbled upon r/myschoollunch and it seems like every sad looking meal is from the US. I’m sure there are many different factors at play here, but I’m wondering what those are and possibly how to solve them.

Edit: the subreddit made me think about the topic overall. It’s not my only reference point for terrible school meals in the US.
