Am I the only one who doesn’t give a shit about my parents recovery?
I truly gave up on ever wanting my dad to get better when I was 16 and I had to sit on a court stand and plead “no comment” to a domestic case against him / regarding my mother. My mother begged me to not testify. The prosecutor begged me to testify against him so that he could be sentenced to rehab and get help. Both my parents told me that if I testified against him they’d disown me. My dad continues to torment me for “calling the cops on my own father” (after he punched my mother to the ground). My mother agreed with him and blamed me for bringing cops to the situation (even after she screamed CALL 911). Fucked me up for life.

Social workers spoke with me and my mother told them I lied because I’m a narcissist who hates my dad. They believed her (??? Why) and did nothing. 

I couldn’t give less of a shit if he ever recovers (he will most likely not - he’s an end stage alcoholic). Just wondering if this is something anyone else feels? Everything about him disgusts me. He says everyday how he wants to die and I don’t care at all. He’s ruined my life enough and now he’s trying to involve himself and ruin my children’s lives.

Every single noise that man makes triggers me. I haven’t been able to look him in the eye for years. He’s truly pathetic in my eyes.
