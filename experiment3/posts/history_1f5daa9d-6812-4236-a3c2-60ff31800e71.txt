British Criminal Tribe Settlements: The Hur commmunity of Sindh.
There is a province in what is Pakistan today called Sindh. Sindh is also famous as the land of Sufi Saints as many passed through the area and many settled here, teaching the Hindu community, many of whom converted to Islam. 

One of these Sufi Saints was the Pir Pagara. The title of Pir Pagara is a hereditary one, and their followers rever and respect whoever the "gadi nasheen" (holder of the throne) is. The followers of the Pir Pagara are divided into two groups; the Salim Jamiat and the Hurs. The Hurs are intensely devoted to the Pir Pagara to this day. 

The Pagaras are a powerful family and have been one for at least 200 years. When the British conquered Sindh, their way of yielding power over the local community was by going through the local elites - in the case of Sindh, many of these local elites were revered Sufi Saints (Refer to Sufi Saints and State Power by Sarah Ansari). 

To put it simply, the Hurs realized that the Pir Pagara was being used like a puppet by the British administration. This did not sit well with them and they rose up against the administration; brutally killing police officers and members of the government. The leaders of this movement were Bachu Badshah (King) and Piru Wazir (minister).

The British took a number of actions to curtail this uprising:

1. They forbade the Pir Pagara from touring among the Hurs and asked the Pir Pagara to end his relationship with any Hurs. 
2. They put the Hurs in criminal tribe settlements on the basis of the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. This act declared entire communities as criminal and allowed the administration to put them in "open air prisons". 

The Hur rebellion went on from the 1890s till the 1940s. 

Many Hurs grew up in settlements and were born in settlements. Deserters were met with severe punishments. Entire Hur villages were burnt down and tribes of Hurs were loaded onto trains and carried off to settlements. Food and water were made scarce. Children were sent to schools to stamp out "Hurism" from them. 

Hurs were freed from settlements in 1952 - 5 years after Pakistan and India's independence. 

Many Hurs born in settlements continue to struggle today in terms of their cultural capital. The label of "daaku" (thief) still follows them everywhere. Their songs talk of the rebellion and the scars are fresh to this day. 

One Hur referred to the settlements as "concentration camps". Their treatment was akin to the way Jews were treated in concentration camps. 

Criminal tribe settlements existed across the colonies and communities still live with the pain of generational trauma. 

Hur history is all but erased from many history books and not referred to in the struggle for independence - as peasant movements are often ignored.

I thought I should share it here. Its part of my Sindhi history; a part erased from history books but remembered in folk tales and oral traditions.
