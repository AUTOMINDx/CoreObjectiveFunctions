After 49 years of verbal abuse, bullying, and threatening, I kicked my dad out of my life yesterday. Independence Day will always be November 30, and it’s a day to celebrate! Quietly, though. Fireworks scare my dogs 😂
My father has fucked up my life, but always acted like it was me being too sensitive, too reactive and basically emotionally unstable because I “couldn’t take a joke.” I spent my entire life believing I was worthless. After 30 years of therapy, I am choosing myself. He is now listed as Fucking Asshole in my phone, though I have blocked him in every conceivable way. 

I just got a whole new life, and I’m so excited! Thanks for your support Reddit. ❤️
