The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase understanding for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Why in places of the Middle East such as Egypt, the Levant and Mesopotamia there are still big and important christian minorities, but not in the Maghreb?
For what I've read, what is modern day Tunisia, coastal Libya and northeastern Algeria, the roman province of Africa (Ifriqiya in arabic) was one of the biggests centers of christianity. It was apparently heavily christianized from early on, and was the home of many important christians (St. Augustine of Hippo being the most notable). However, after the arabic invasions and the islamization of the area, basically no traces of Christianity remained, or remained in very insignificant numbers. Meanwhile, in Egypt, the Levant and Mesopotamia, while a minority, christianity remained being an important religion and a very big minority, being majority in Lebanon until recently and like around 10% of Egypt as of now, and entire ethnic groups such as the Copts and the Assyrians remained basing their existence on the christian religion.

So why didn't this happen in North Africa (Apart from Egypt)? Why Tunisia, Libya or Algeria doesn't have important christian minorities apart from recent post-colonial imports such as the kabyle catholics? What were the historical or cultural reasons for the dissappearence of the Christian religion in the Maghreb? Also why groups such as the Assyrians and Copts managed to survive arabization and Islamization but not the African Romans and Cyrenaican Greeks?
