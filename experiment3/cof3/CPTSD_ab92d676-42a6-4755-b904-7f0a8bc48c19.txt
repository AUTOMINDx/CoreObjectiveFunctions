The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase understanding for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
DAE have a fantasy word they spend more of their time in, as a coping mechanism for their reality?
I have this imaginary world that I’ve visualized for myself for 10-15 years from now, complete with an imaginary wife and children. They have names, and even distinct faces.

I spend time talking to them, playing with my kids. It’s pathetic, I know. Call me an incel or whatever. But I’ve only recently realized how much time I actually spend in this world, to the point where it has almost become my reality.

Does anyone else do this?
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase understanding:
1. "It's normal to feel the need to escape from reality sometimes. It sounds like your imaginary world provides a sense of comfort and security for you."
2. "It's normal to have imaginary friends or family members. In a way, they are a part of your subconscious and can be a source of comfort or security."
3. "It's okay to have a fantasy life. In fact, it can be a healthy way to cope with difficult situations. Just make sure that the majority of your time is spent in the real world."
4. "It's good that you've realized how much time you're spending in your imaginary world. Maybe there are some things you can do to bring more balance to your life."
5. "There is no shame in having an imaginary life. It shows that you are imaginative and creative. Just make sure that you are also living in the real world."
