END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase understanding:
1. "Hmm" is often used to show that we're thinking or considering what the other person has said. It can be a way to show that we're listening and that we care. 
2. Sometimes people use "hmm" when they're unsure of what to say or they need more information. 
3. It's possible that the person you're talking to is feeling confused or uncertain about something. Maybe you could provide more information or clarification. 
4. "Hmmm" can also be a way to show that we're interested in what the other person has to say. 
5. Sometimes "hmm" is used to show that we're skeptical or don't agree with something.
