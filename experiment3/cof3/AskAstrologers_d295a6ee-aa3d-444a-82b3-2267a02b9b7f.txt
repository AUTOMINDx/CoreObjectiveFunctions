The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase understanding for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
All Virgo Everything ðŸ˜­ Anyone else feel pigeonholed?

END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase understanding:
1. "Yes, I can certainly understand how you might feel that way. Many people feel pigeonholed at times, especially if they don't feel they fit into the conventional idea of what it means to be a Virgo."

2. "It sounds like you don't feel that you fit into the conventional idea of what it means to be a Virgo. Is there something specific about that that bothers you?"

3. "I'm sorry that you feel that way. Can you give me some examples of when you feel pigeonholed?"
