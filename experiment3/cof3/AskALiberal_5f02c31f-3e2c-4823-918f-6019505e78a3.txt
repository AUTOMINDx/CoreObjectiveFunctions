The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase understanding for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
What "small" scandal from 2017-2020 do you want to get answers to?
For me it's who in the Customs and Border Patrol agency kept issuing press releases referring to "1,488" migrants.

14 and 88 of course being very well known neo nazi numbers.

I want that person named and shamed.
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase understanding:
1. "It's understandable that you would want answers to this. The events of the past few years have been difficult for many people."
2. "It's important that we hold those in power accountable for their actions. It sounds like you want to do that in this case."
3. "It's important to remember that every action has consequences. Sometimes it can be difficult to see that when we're caught up in the moment."
4. "It's understandable to feel outraged by something like this. We need to remember that though, and channel that outrage into positive change."
