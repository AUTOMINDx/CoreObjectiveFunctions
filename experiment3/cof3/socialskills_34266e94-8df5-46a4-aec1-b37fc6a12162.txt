USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
I hate that being socially awkward is seen as creepy or weird by so many people
I’m naturally not good at dealing with people. It’s just not a skill I have. I deal with a lot of anxiety surrounding most social situations and it results in me being very awkward. 

I try to not inconvenience or bother anyone so I try to make myself as invisible as possible. Because of this many of normal actions are seen as creepy. I stare into space a lot so no one thinks I’m looking in their direction. I also tend to just keep to myself so I’m often by myself and do things alone.

If I’m in a group of people who are talking I’ll never talk do people that have something that matters to say can speak. I also try to stand out if peoples way physically and I end up on the sidelines or alone or off to the side of a group of people.

I’ve been told that these things make me look creepy, weird, and like a serial killer. I just don’t want to take up other peoples space. I just want to be able to blend in to the background and I don’t get why this is seen as creepy.

Back when I was in high school I got picked on so much for not really talking or having friends. People have asked me if I’m on the autism spectrum which I feel is a very rude question in and of itself, especially so since I’m not.

I’m 20 and in college now and it’s gotten easier to be the way I am but I still get weird looks it told by people I know I look creepy just existing. I just feel out of place around regular people and I shouldn’t make them be around me. I’m just trying to do everyone a favor and I get judged for it.

I really hope that one day I’ll just be allowed to be the way I am without others thinking I’m a freak for doing it.
