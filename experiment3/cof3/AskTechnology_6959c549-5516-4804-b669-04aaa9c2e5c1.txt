The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase understanding for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
What is Gartner's track record in forecasting tech trends?
As a marketing communications consultant working mostly with the tech sector, I get sent on a lot of Gartner papers from clients - both for the purpose of explaining their industry landscape and showing how they would like to position themselves in the market.

A perspective I'd love to get from somebody with a longer career, however, is ... how reliable do these predictions tend to be?

In other words: looking back at Gartner's track record - which they're unlikely to share unless it's rosey - how successful have they been at actually forecasting the direction that emerging technology categories will take? 

I think knowing that would be helpful when trying to decide how much weight to place on their prognostics for a certain sector (Etc).
