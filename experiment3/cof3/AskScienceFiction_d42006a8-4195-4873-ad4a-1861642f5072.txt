The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase understanding for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
[Spider-Man 2] Why did the bank have so many coins?
In preparation for No Way Home I’ve been rewatching the older movies. 

In Spider-Man 2 Doc Ock robs a bank and Spider-Man stops him. When Spidey first swings in Ock throws several large bags of golden coins at him. 

Doesn’t America use mostly paper money? Why are there so many large coins at a bank?
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase understanding:
1. "There are many different types of currency around the world. In some countries, like Australia, coins are more common than paper money. It's possible that the bank was preparing for a currency conversion."
2. "It's possible that the bank was stocking up on coins in case there was a power outage or some other emergency that would require people to use coins instead of paper money."
3. "It's possible that the bank was preparing for a robbery like the one in Spider-Man 2. They may have been expecting Doc Ock to try and rob the bank again."
