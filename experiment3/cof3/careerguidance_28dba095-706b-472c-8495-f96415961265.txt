The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase understanding for the user.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Should I inform my boss that I want leave even there is no lined up job yet?
I joined company at very beginning(when we had just 4 people, now about 40) 6 years ago. I have no issue with current job, my boss and I like friend. In 6 years I just asked for a raise once, but I have several raises in 6 years, I'm at highest rank in the team now. So I can say he treated me well(in company scope).

Reason I want to quite is we're tech company and he isn't a tech guy(sometime he ask me to install software for him lol), I feel like I can't grow any more or slowly in this field if I keep work here. I learn new things myself and suggest to change but seem company want to be at stable state for now. I want to jump and want to have more income.

I want to share my plan and he can has his own plan, that is my thought.

PS: we have bigger boss and he works oversea.

I'd like to hear from your thoughts. Thank you for reading.
