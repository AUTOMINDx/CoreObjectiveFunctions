The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Are most boys like this?
I 16f have a boyfriend 16m. He was over at mine, and at night whenever we’re at each other’s house it’s basically routine at this point
I’ll lay up next to him and he’ll play with my hair, or hold me. 

But this time he asked if we could swap things about. When I was running my nails on his scalp his reactions were so intense lol 😂 like “shit that’s so goooood fuck.” And I vous just tell by his body language and stuff as well. 

Like I get it, it’s nice and relaxing, but it’s like he was entering another plane of existence. Idk if it’s just a me thing or a boys bs girls thing or what lol 😂
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "Boys are different, and it's normal for them to experience things differently than girls."
2. "It sounds like you're feeling uncomfortable with what your boyfriend is doing. Do you want to talk about it?"
3. "Getting massages can be really relaxing, but it sounds like your boyfriend was really enjoying it. Do you have any questions about what he was doing?"
