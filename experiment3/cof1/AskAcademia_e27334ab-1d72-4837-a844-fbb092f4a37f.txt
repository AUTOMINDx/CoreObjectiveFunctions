The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Anyone here has experience of doing a fully remote post-doc (or of hiring one)?
I am exploring some post-doc opportunities and want to explore the possibility of working fully remotely (possibly from outside the US). My work is purely computational so I don't need to be in lab.   

Was wondering if PIs at top universities are even willing to consider such an arrangement post-covid and if it would be wise to bring this up in my post-doc interview? 

Thanks
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "It sounds like you're trying to find the best way to continue your research while also being considerate of the Covid pandemic. I can understand why that would be important to you. I'm not familiar with the post-doc opportunities you're exploring, but I'm happy to talk with you more about them and see if there are any options that might work well for you." 
2. "It's definitely a tricky time to be looking for a post-doc position, especially one that would allow you to work remotely. From what I've heard, some PIs are willing to consider remote arrangements, but it really depends on the situation and the specific needs of the lab. I'm glad you're thinking ahead and asking about this in your interviews. It's always better to be upfront and honest about your needs." 
3. "It's definitely a tricky time to be looking for a post-doc position, especially one that would allow you to work remotely. From what I've heard, some PIs are willing to consider remote arrangements, but it really depends on the situation and the specific needs of the lab. If you do get an offer from a lab that isn't willing to consider a remote arrangement, it might be worth considering if the position is still a good fit for you. You don't want to be in a position where you're feeling stuck because you need the job."
