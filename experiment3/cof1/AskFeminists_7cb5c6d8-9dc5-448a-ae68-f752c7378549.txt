The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
do you recall how sites like memecenter were filled with sexism?
I used to visit websites like that and so many memes were riddled with misogyny and sexism:

Saying women on their periods are like monsters

women only date douches 

women can't drive

women have faulty logic

the amount of hatred for justin bieber and women can't be nerds

and wow...looking back it was so toxic? I was wondering, why is it like that?
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "These memes reflect a deep-seated societal problem that is unfortunately still very present today. Misogyny is alive and well, and it's something that we need to be continually working to change. We can start by educating ourselves and others on the issue, and by calling out sexism when we see it."

2. "It's sad that these kinds of memes are so popular, because they only contribute to the cycle of negativity and hatred towards women. We can try to avoid spreading these messages by sharing more positive, empowering content."

3. "It's really unfortunate that these kinds of memes are so pervasive. They can make women feel really down and like they're not valued. We can try to combat this by creating more content that celebrates women and their accomplishments."
