The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
How do some people seem so stress free when it seems like being an adult is so complicated?
There's a car insurance bill, car payment, internet, gym bill, groceries, phone, plus trying to save. Some bills are automatic and some aren't and I just can't wrap my head around it. 

I'm 20 and so confused. It also seems like many people my age move out and can buy Starbucks every day and go so many places but if I did I'd have to budget and those actions would be pretty irresponsible if I did them a lot. How TF do people operate??
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "It can be complicated to be an adult, but it's important to stay mindful and organized. Can you tell me more about your concerns?"
2. "It's natural to feel confused and overwhelmed at times. Can you tell me more about which aspects of adulthood are causing you the most stress?"
3. "Adulting can be tough, but it's important to remember that every person is different. Some people can handle a lot of financial responsibility at once, while others need to take things slower. What do you think might be the best approach for you?"
4. "It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to live up to a certain standard. Remember that there's no one right way to do things. You can always find inspiration in others, but don't forget to trust your own intuition too."
