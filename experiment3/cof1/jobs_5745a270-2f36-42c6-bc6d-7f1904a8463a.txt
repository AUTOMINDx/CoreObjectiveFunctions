The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
I gave them a week notice I was quitting. Tomorrow is my last day and no one has responded to me. Fuck em.
This is my first professional job. I work in the engineering field. I’m a tech. I told them September 4th I am moving to a different state and requested a transfer. I told them specifically December 29th I’m moving and would like an answer by December 4th. They have been stringing me along this whole time telling me I “should” get a call from the office I want to work in “sometime this week.”

I’m the only woman here of a team of 30 in the electrical field and I feel like they don’t listen to me or care about me at all. It’s so annoying. I’ve had so much anxiety about whether or not I’d get a transfer, but it seems to me they keep stringing me along so I can just quit. 


I found a new job with a $8 raise and a $2,000 sign on and a work from home position. Emailed my boss a week ago my last day will be in a week. No response. Good enough for me. Peace out. Don’t really care about their reference anyways.
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "I'm sorry that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you've been through a lot."
2. "I understand that you're frustrated. No one seems to be listening to you."
3. "It sounds like you're feeling unsupported at your job. That can be really frustrating."
4. "It sounds like you're feeling a lot of stress and anxiety about the transfer. That's understandable."
5. "It sounds like you're feeling like you don't have a voice at work. That can be really frustrating."
