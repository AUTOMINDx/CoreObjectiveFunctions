The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
What "small" scandal from 2017-2020 do you want to get answers to?
For me it's who in the Customs and Border Patrol agency kept issuing press releases referring to "1,488" migrants.

14 and 88 of course being very well known neo nazi numbers.

I want that person named and shamed.
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "I'm so sorry that you're feeling upset about this. It's definitely frustrating when we don't have all of the answers. Can I suggest some resources that might help you get some closure?"
2. "That sounds really frustrating. Do you want to talk about it more? I might be able to offer some insights based on my professional experience."
3. "This situation is definitely causing a lot of pain and anger. Is there anything I can do to help you process these feelings?"
