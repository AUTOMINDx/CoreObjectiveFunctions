The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
How?
To people who have therapist. How do you do it? How are you able to trust them so much that you're able to be vulnerable with them? I don't understand it. I can't even tell my friends how I'm feeling. I can't even tell my parents how I am truly! I really need some help I've been generally getting worse since the day goes by. I've been thinking about doing horrible things to myself and I don't think it's going to stop. I'm afraid I'm going to do something horrible to myself. So tell me how? How are you able to trust them I can't put my finger around it. They're strangers, they can say stuff behind your back! They could even make fun of your trauma behind your back or tell people about it without your permission. So how? I need to know.
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "It can be difficult to trust strangers, especially when you're feeling vulnerable. Trust is something that is built over time, through interactions and experiences that demonstrate that the therapist cares about your wellbeing. It's important to find a therapist who you feel is respectful and supportive, and who you feel comfortable communicating with. If you don't feel comfortable talking with your therapist, it might be helpful to consider finding a new one."
2. "It's natural to feel afraid when you're considering sharing sensitive information with someone. However, it's important to remember that your therapist is legally and ethically obligated to keep your information confidential. They are not allowed to share anything that you discuss with them without your permission. You can also ask your therapist about their confidentiality policies, and about any precautions they take to protect your information."
3. "Therapists are trained to handle sensitive information in a respectful and confidential manner. They are experienced in dealing with difficult emotions and situations, and are equipped to help you manage your mental health. They are also bound by law to keep your information confidential. If you have any concerns about how your therapist will handle your information, you can always ask them directly."
