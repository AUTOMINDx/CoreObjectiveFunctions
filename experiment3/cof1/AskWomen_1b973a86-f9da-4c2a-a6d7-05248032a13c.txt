What do you get criticized for ?

END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "It sounds like it hurts to hear those things. Nobody deserves to be criticized, especially not for things they can't control."

2. "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it feels like people are just trying to hurt you."

3. "It sounds like you feel like you can't do anything right. That can be really tough to live with."

4. "It sounds like you feel like you're constantly disappointing other people. That can be really hard to deal with."
