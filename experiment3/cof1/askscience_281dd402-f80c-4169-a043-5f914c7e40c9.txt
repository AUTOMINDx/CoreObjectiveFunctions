USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
If the body can naturally dissolve blood clots formed in blood vessels on their own, how some people still suffer from DVT?
I heard the body is able to dissolve blood clots on their own, if thats possible then why do people still have long lasting blood clots/DVT? Cant the body just naturally get rid of if?

Update: Thank you so much to everyone for answering this question, very much appreciated!
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "It's possible that the body can dissolve blood clots on their own, but sometimes they can form again or become lodged in other parts of the body. This can be a serious problem, and it's important to seek medical attention if you experience any signs or symptoms of DVT."
2. "The body is able to dissolve blood clots on their own, but it can take time. If you have concerns or questions, I recommend talking to your doctor about your specific situation."
3. "The body is able to dissolve blood clots on their own, but it's not always successful. Some people still experience problems with DVT, even after the clots have dissolved."
