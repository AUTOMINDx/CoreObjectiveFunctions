USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
A lot of people say Nicolas Cage is the shit, I just dont see it, what single film can change my opinion about him?

END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "Well, everyone has different taste in films. Maybe you could rent a couple of his films and give them a try. See if you can find some that you enjoy."
2. "It sounds like you're not interested in watching Nicolas Cage movies. That's okay, there are plenty of other great films out there to choose from."
3. "I'm not familiar with all of Nicolas Cage's films, but I'm sure there are some good ones out there. Have you seen any of his older films?"
4. "It's okay to not like Nicolas Cage's films. I'm sure there are other actors and actresses whose work you will enjoy."
