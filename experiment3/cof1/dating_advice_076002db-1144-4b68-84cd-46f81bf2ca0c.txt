The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Men, do you ever worry that a woman is only going on dates with you for the free food/drinks/entertainment?
Disclaimer: This question is from a curious woman, not an angry man! 

Have you ever dated a woman/women and been concerned you’re simply used for the food, drinks, entertainment that comes with dates?

If so, what are your red flags that this is the case? What can a woman do to prove it’s not? (Beyond the obvious paying for some things)
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "It's possible that a woman is only going on dates with you for free food and drinks, but it's also possible that she's interested in you as a person. Until you know for sure, it's best to give her the benefit of the doubt."

2. "There are red flags that could indicate a woman is only interested in you for free food and drinks. If you're concerned, you could talk to her about it and see how she responds."

3. "There are a few things a woman can do to prove she's not just interested in you for free food and drinks. For example, she could pay for some things on the date or offer to split the bill."
