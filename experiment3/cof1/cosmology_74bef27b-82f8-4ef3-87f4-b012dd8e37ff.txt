The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Not entirely related to the field of Cosmology, but still relevant non the less. For anyone interested in a rigorous treatment of the Everett interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, I highly advise you check this out. Best treatment Iâ€™ve read on the subject.

END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "Wow, that sounds really interesting! I'm so glad you found a resource that works well for you."

2. "Thanks for showing me that. I'll check it out and see if it's something that might be helpful for me."

3. "Thank you for sharing that with me. I'm really glad to hear that you've found a resource that works well for you."
