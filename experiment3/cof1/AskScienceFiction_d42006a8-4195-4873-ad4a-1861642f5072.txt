The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
[Spider-Man 2] Why did the bank have so many coins?
In preparation for No Way Home I’ve been rewatching the older movies. 

In Spider-Man 2 Doc Ock robs a bank and Spider-Man stops him. When Spidey first swings in Ock throws several large bags of golden coins at him. 

Doesn’t America use mostly paper money? Why are there so many large coins at a bank?
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "I'm sorry that you had to see that. Banks sometimes have coins on hand in case of an emergency."

2. "It can be confusing when we see things that are different from what we're used to. Do you want me to explain why banks have coins?"

3. "It's interesting that you asked that question. I'm sure there's a good reason why the bank had so many coins."

4. "This can be a confusing topic. Let me see if I can explain it in a way that makes sense to you."
