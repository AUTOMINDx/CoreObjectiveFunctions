The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
I’ve decided I’m just going to say I’m chronically awesome from now on… my new superpower is I’ve finally learned how to say no, and boy is that ever amazing. How about you? What has your life taught you so far?

END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "It sounds like you're working hard to take care of yourself. I'm proud of you for that."
2. "I'm glad you've found a way to make saying no work for you. It can be a powerful tool."
3. "It sounds like you're on a journey of self-discovery. I'm here to support you however I can."
