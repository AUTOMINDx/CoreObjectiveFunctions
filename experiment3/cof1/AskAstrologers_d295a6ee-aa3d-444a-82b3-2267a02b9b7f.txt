The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
All Virgo Everything ðŸ˜­ Anyone else feel pigeonholed?

END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "I'm sorry that you feel pigeonholed. I understand that it can be frustrating when we feel like we're stuck in a certain role."

2. "It sounds like you don't feel like your talents are being fully utilized."

3. "I can see how you would feel frustrated in that situation. It's common to feel that way when we're not doing what we're passionate about."

4. "Do you have any ideas about what you would like to do instead?"

5. "I recommend that you take some time to reflect on what you would like to do next. Maybe try writing down what you would like to do, or talking to someone about your options."
