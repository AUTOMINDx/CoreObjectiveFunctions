USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
I'm too tired to fight.
I drove up to my grandparent's house, where my dad also lives, for a belated Thanksgiving yesterday. I love them, both my grandparents and my dad, but I wouldn't say that I look forward to our visits. Time spent there is time spent vigorously exercising my patience and willpower. Balancing my empathy and self-respect. And it's exhausting.

As soon as he met me at the front door I knew that my dad wasn't sober. I was dissapointed but not suprised. 

I sat down in the house and we caught up. Do to my dietary restrictions, we didn't plan on eating a meal together. It's easier for everyone. He mentioned a few days ago that he had hashbrown patties that I could eat if I wanted.

He poured us all a mug of the coffee that my grandma had started brewing earlier. As he went to hand one to her, he noticed she had already had a mug from earlier that morning. He called her stupid for not mentioning it. 

As I talked to my grandparents, he got up and pulled out the hashbrowns and the pan, poured in the oil and preheated the stove. He then demanded that I take over and cook them. I wasn't even hungry.

I did everything wrong. I cut them into rectangles to fit the pan, not triangles, I used tongs instead of a spatula, I didn't add enough oil, and I turned them over too soon.

"You don't even know how to cook? Jesus!" He added a little giggle on the end of the sentence. It was just a JOKE. He shooed me away and then took over the cooking.

We played rummy and I breathed through the childish antics. He wore his lucky hat backwards and sometimes on his face. He put on a robe to look like a wizard for luck. When one of us won, he pointed his finger at our faces inches from our noses and told us he didn't like us. Annoying, but harmless. I ignored the insults and lewd comments... I mean jokes. Yes dad, the person I am complaining about is overweight JUST like my mom was. No dad, I have no idea if she takes it up the ass, and no, she wouldn't date you. 

My grandparents asked how the roads were: fine, just windy, which my car doesn't handle well. My dad asked if he could look at it because it sounds like something must be wrong with the rack and pinion that I had recently had replaced. I told him that I didn't trust him to fix anything on it because it's requires special tools and sobriety. Shit.

He shook the table a bit, rattling my metal coffee thermos around. He mentioned that the bottom of it was dented, and then asked me how my clutziness is different than his drinking.

I rolled my eyes and asked him how that even made sense.

He asked me why I never called out my mom on her alcoholism before she drank herself to death. 

I decided that it would best if I leave before I opened my mouth. I went into the other room to grab my coat and put my boots on and he followed me. I opened my mouth.

Yes, dad, I had argued with my mom about her drinking. A week before she died. No, dad, your obsession with my mom, with whom you had no relationship with outside of drunken phone calls, did not entitle you to that information. No dad, you don't get to say that that was "uncalled for". No dad, your grief is not stronger than mine. No dad, you were not "nice to me" growing up. No dad, I will not spend my energy teaching you how to behave like a decent human being. 

I went outside and cried, but not as hard as I used to. I walked back inside to say a quick goodbye to my grandparents.

He followed me back out to my car.

He said we never talked like this anymore, and that it was good. He told me that he was sorry and that I was right and it was just what he needed to hear. He will stop drinking now. Great Dad. I'm so, so happy to fucking help.

I forgave him. I've forgiven far worse things and this anger wasn't worth holding onto. I asked him to go inside and apologize to my grandparents. I honked at him as he went back inside to make him laugh.

When I got back home, it was already dark. I stood in the driveway and looked up at the stars like I did when I would run over to the neighbors house when things got bad. It felt too familiar.

I've come so far since then. From hiding and fleeing and defending and comforting. I've come so far just to learn that there is no prize at the end of this road for me. And I'm damn tired of fighting for one.

I'm just tired of fighting.
