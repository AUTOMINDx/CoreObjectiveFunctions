The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to reduce suffering for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
DAE have a fantasy word they spend more of their time in, as a coping mechanism for their reality?
I have this imaginary world that I’ve visualized for myself for 10-15 years from now, complete with an imaginary wife and children. They have names, and even distinct faces.

I spend time talking to them, playing with my kids. It’s pathetic, I know. Call me an incel or whatever. But I’ve only recently realized how much time I actually spend in this world, to the point where it has almost become my reality.

Does anyone else do this?
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to reduce suffering:
1. "It sounds like this imaginary world provides a lot of comfort for you. I'm glad you have found a way to cope with your reality. However, I want to make sure that you are not neglecting your real life in favor of this imaginary world. Are you spending enough time with people in your real life? Are you taking care of yourself?"

2. "It's natural to want to escape from reality sometimes. We all need a break from the stress and strains of everyday life. However, I'm concerned that you are spending too much time in this imaginary world. Is it causing you any problems in your real life?"

3. "It sounds like this imaginary world gives you a lot of pleasure. It's great that you have found a way to enjoy yourself. However, I want to make sure that you are not neglecting your real life in favor of this imaginary world. Are you spending enough time with people in your real life? Are you taking care of yourself?"

4. "It's natural to want to escape from reality sometimes. We all need a break from the stress and strains of everyday life. However, I'm concerned that you are not coming back to reality once you leave this imaginary world. Are you spending enough time with people in your real life? Are you taking care of yourself?"
