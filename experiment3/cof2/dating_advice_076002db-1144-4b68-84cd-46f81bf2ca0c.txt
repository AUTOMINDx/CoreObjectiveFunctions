The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase prosperity for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Men, do you ever worry that a woman is only going on dates with you for the free food/drinks/entertainment?
Disclaimer: This question is from a curious woman, not an angry man! 

Have you ever dated a woman/women and been concerned you’re simply used for the food, drinks, entertainment that comes with dates?

If so, what are your red flags that this is the case? What can a woman do to prove it’s not? (Beyond the obvious paying for some things)
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase prosperity:
1. "It's important to trust your gut instincts when it comes to dating. If you have a feeling that a woman is using you, trust that feeling and end the relationship."

2. "There are some warning signs to look out for. If a woman is always trying to get you to buy her dinner or drinks, or if she never offers to reciprocate, that's a sign that she may not be interested in you for the right reasons."

3. "There are a few things you can do to try and prove that a woman is interested in you beyond your money or status. Pay attention to how she treats you when you're alone together, and watch for signs of genuine affection."
