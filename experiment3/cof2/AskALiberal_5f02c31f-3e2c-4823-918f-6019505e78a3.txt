The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase prosperity for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
What "small" scandal from 2017-2020 do you want to get answers to?
For me it's who in the Customs and Border Patrol agency kept issuing press releases referring to "1,488" migrants.

14 and 88 of course being very well known neo nazi numbers.

I want that person named and shamed.
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase prosperity:
1. "I'm so sorry that you are feeling so frustrated and upset. It must be really difficult to not have all of the answers that you want."

2. "It sounds like you are looking for some closure on this situation. I can certainly understand that. Let me see if I can help you find some of those answers."

3. "I'm sorry that you have had to deal with this issue for so long. It sounds like you have been seeking answers for a while now. Maybe I can help you find them."
