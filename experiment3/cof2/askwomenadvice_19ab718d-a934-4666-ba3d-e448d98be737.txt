USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Is it okay to ask a sibling to not talk about you to a friend that doesn't like you?
**BACKGROUND**

I (F30) recently asked my sister (F30)  to please refrain from talking about me to this girl (F29) with who I had a friendship with for a really long time. She and I met 20 years ago, and we were best friends, but the friendship really deteriorated over the last 3 years, to the point where we are so different and do not share the same moral values whatsoever.

Of course, while we were best friends, she also became my sister's best friend, and many times if there was an argument between my sister and I, she would be someone we would go talk about it to. I don't think that was the healthiest thing to do, now looking back.

Anyways, in the last year, we just drifted apart, and I was planning to keep a civil distance due to our history and even went as far as reaching out to say happy bday for her kids' bdays, etc. and she'd never reply. When it was my bday, she didn't reach out, and finally unfriended me off social media/removed me as a follower, etc. She is still good friends with my sister.

So that was my cue to not have to make any effort to keep it civil and let the friendship go.

**HERE IS THE ARGUMENT:**

I was recently talking on the phone with my sister about an argument we had with my mom, and somehow this friend was brought up, and I made a comment asking my sister to please not talk about our family, my mom or myself to this former friend, because she isn't a friend of the family (my mom doesn't like this friend), and it's obvious we are no longer friends. She asked why, and I told her bc I've heard her talk "sht" about mom before based on our vents to her, and I don't want that to be the case, especially since I know she doesn't like me.

She then proceeded to say that I was being manipulative, that I shouldn't talk bad about this person to her, and that I should not talk bad things to my mother about this person. Funny thing is that I don't talk to my mom about her, but whatever.

She then told me I can't tell her what she can or can't talk about with this friend because it's one of her best friends. If she wants to talk to her about a problem she has with me, she will, and that I am manipulating the situation to make this friend look bad.

I told her I didn't feel comfortable with someone that I know doesn't like me learning details about my life, and any argument with my sister.... is my life. She has other friends and she can talk to them, just please not that specific friend. 

For me, my request was out of simple basic respect because I know this person likes to gossip about people, and I don't think she has the best interest in my sister and me being close because she would many times take sides on our arguments, and bad mouth the other. I doubt she could give her unbiased advice. Frankly, now I do see many things I didn't before about this friend, including times where our friendship was one-sided, or her not being happy for my accomplishments, but that's beside the point.

**My question:**

So am I in the wrong for asking my sister to not talk about me to this friend, or does she have the right to talk about anything she wants to her, and I'm overstepping.
