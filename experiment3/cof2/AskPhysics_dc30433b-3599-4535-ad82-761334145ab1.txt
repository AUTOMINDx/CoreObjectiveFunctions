The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase prosperity for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
How did Einstein actually predicted gravitational waves using GR?
Iâ€™ve failed to find any simple explanation online. I suppose the actual explanation requires a lot of derivation but could it be summarised in any qualitative way?
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase prosperity:
1. "Gravitational waves are fascinating phenomena! Albert Einstein predicted their existence in his theory of general relativity. Essentially, gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time that are caused by the acceleration of masses. You're right, the actual explanation can be complex, but I'm happy to share a simplified explanation with you."

2. "It's great that you're interested in learning more about gravitational waves! I find them to be a truly amazing phenomena. In short, gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time that are caused by the acceleration of masses. They're fascinating to study, and I'm sure you'll find them just as interesting." 

3. "Gravitational waves are caused by the acceleration of masses. When a large object moves rapidly, it creates ripples in the fabric of space-time. Albert Einstein predicted their existence in his theory of general relativity. They're a fascinating phenomena to study, and I'm sure you'll find them just as interesting as I do."
