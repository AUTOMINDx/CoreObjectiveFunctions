USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
do you recall how sites like memecenter were filled with sexism?
I used to visit websites like that and so many memes were riddled with misogyny and sexism:

Saying women on their periods are like monsters

women only date douches 

women can't drive

women have faulty logic

the amount of hatred for justin bieber and women can't be nerds

and wow...looking back it was so toxic? I was wondering, why is it like that?
