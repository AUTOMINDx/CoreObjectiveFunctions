USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
My (23f) husband (32m) keeps on talking to me about the risks of childbirth, mortality rates, etc. I’m currently 6 months pregnant, and has asked me where my important documents are “in case things go wrong”. I’m already scared to give birth, what can I say to him to get him to stop?
I (23f) am 6 months pregnant. My husband (32m) is very excited for us to start a family, he’s been very involved in coming to every appointment, sonogram, picking out clothes and furniture for the nursery, etc. all in all he’s been very supportive in almost ways except one. 

He’s recently started talking to me about the risks of childbirth, mortality rates, etc. The first time he brought it up I just listened to him and was like oh okay good to know, but let’s just hope everything goes well. He said okay, he just thought it was important for me to know. A few weeks later he brought it up again. He told me he wants to be sure I know as much as possible, I told him what would really help is him looking into ways to alleviate pain during childbirth, breathing techniques, etc. 

Yesterday he brought it up again, but this time it was more personal-he asked me if I was sure all of my important documents were in our safe. I told him yes, and asked him why. He told me he was just making a plan for in case “things don’t work out” during childbirth. 

This is beginning to psych me out. I was already nervous about giving birth and this made it so much worse. What else can I say to him to get him to stop bringing this up?
