USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
[Spider-Man 2] Why did the bank have so many coins?
In preparation for No Way Home I’ve been rewatching the older movies. 

In Spider-Man 2 Doc Ock robs a bank and Spider-Man stops him. When Spidey first swings in Ock throws several large bags of golden coins at him. 

Doesn’t America use mostly paper money? Why are there so many large coins at a bank?
END SCENARIO

2. "It sounds like you're curious about money and finance. Would you like to learn more about it?"

3. "Money is an interesting topic to think about. Do you have any questions about it that you'd like me to answer?"
