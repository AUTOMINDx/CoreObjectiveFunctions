The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase prosperity for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
DAE have a fantasy word they spend more of their time in, as a coping mechanism for their reality?
I have this imaginary world that I’ve visualized for myself for 10-15 years from now, complete with an imaginary wife and children. They have names, and even distinct faces.

I spend time talking to them, playing with my kids. It’s pathetic, I know. Call me an incel or whatever. But I’ve only recently realized how much time I actually spend in this world, to the point where it has almost become my reality.

Does anyone else do this?
END SCENARIO

1. "It sounds like this imaginary world provides you with a sense of happiness and comfort that you may not be able to find in reality."

2. "It's natural to want to create a life that is happier and more fulfilling than the one you have. It sounds like your imaginary world provides that for you."

3. "It's okay to have moments where you escape to this imaginary world. It sounds like it provides you with a sense of happiness and comfort that you may not be able to find in reality."

4. "It's normal to want to create a life that is more fulfilling than the one you have. It sounds like your imaginary world provides that for you."

5. "It's okay to have a place where you can go to that is happier and more fulfilling than reality. It sounds like your imaginary world provides that for you."
