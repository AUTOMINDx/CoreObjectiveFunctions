USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
I wish my brain would of developed to be a happy and productive individual who actually enjoys being alive
But instead it developed to feel numb towards pretty much everything and anything, and I literally canâ€™t stand the fact that I have to get up every single day and LIVE. I donâ€™t enjoy anything that life has to offer. I donâ€™t care about being rich and having nice things.. that stuff doesnâ€™t motivate me at all in life. All I want is to not have to deal with the fact I gotta pressure and force myself everyday to care about existing when it reality I DONâ€™T CARE ABOUT BEING HERE AT ALLðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ not even a little bit
