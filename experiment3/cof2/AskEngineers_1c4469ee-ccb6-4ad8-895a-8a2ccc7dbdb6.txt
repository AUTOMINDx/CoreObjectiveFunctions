USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Are there any negatives to telling my manager I’m planning to take the FE exam?
So I’ve been studying to take the FE exam and my progress is slow. Things at work are at a standstill, so I’m thinking for asking if I could study during work hours and it classify as “training.”

Do I run any risk letting my job know I plan on taking the FE exam? My current job doesn’t require it and my department doesn’t have a lot of PEs. I fear they’ll interpret me taking the FE as me wanting to leave / looking for new opportunities.
