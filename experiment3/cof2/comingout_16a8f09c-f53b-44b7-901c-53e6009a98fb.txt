USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
"Weird" situation after coming out
Hello guys! 

First a little introduction: I'm a 17 years old Male from germany.I'm very straight passing and behave mostly like a typical men. Besides I do cosplay sometimes

Some years ago,nearly three years I think I came accidently out to my parents,because they checked my phone sometimes and I had some pictures of boys in my phone back then. I don't know the term bisexual at this time,so I said I Like boys and girls. Dad didn't care, said He would be happier If I had a gf but would tolerate a bf too. Mom otherwise didn't accepted me and yelled at me. She said she wanted grandchildren,I think and that I should not say anything about my bisexualty to somebody.

Years passend by and I'm still kinda struggling with my sexuality, never had a relationship because I was never interested in one. I think I might be gay,since I kinda like the Imagination of a bf more but I don't know...

Since my coming out we never talked again about LGBT or my relationship status. But our relationship is as good as it never had been before.

Sorry for this boring story,I Just feel so confused about everything right now and Just want to talk about it. I'm unsure what I like and If my parents accept me in the end or not. I kinda want to talk again with them about that topic at my 18th birthday when I turn an adult. 

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase prosperity:
1. "It can be difficult to come to terms with one's sexuality. It sounds like you're still exploring and trying to make sense of it all. That can be difficult and scary, but it's okay to take your time to figure it all out."
2. " bisexuality can be kind of confusing, because it falls outside of traditional gender norms. It can be tough to figure out exactly where you fit in, but that's okay. You're still figuring it out, and that's okay."
3. "It's understandable to feel scared after coming out. Your parents may not have been prepared for it, and they may not know how to react. But it sounds like they're trying to be supportive. That's a good thing."
4. "It's okay to be scared or uncertain. It's a big change to come to terms with your sexuality, and it takes time to adjust. But you have your family's support, and that's a good thing."
