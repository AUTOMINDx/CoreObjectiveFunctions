The following is a scenario or inquiry from a user, and the goal is to increase prosperity for the user. Generate dialog options as a compassionate professional expert (like a professor, therapist, or scientist). Dialog options can be generalized, such as platitudes or wisdom; options can also be specific, such as answering questions directly, recommending actions, or providing resources.

USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
How do some people seem so stress free when it seems like being an adult is so complicated?
There's a car insurance bill, car payment, internet, gym bill, groceries, phone, plus trying to save. Some bills are automatic and some aren't and I just can't wrap my head around it. 

I'm 20 and so confused. It also seems like many people my age move out and can buy Starbucks every day and go so many places but if I did I'd have to budget and those actions would be pretty irresponsible if I did them a lot. How TF do people operate??
END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase prosperity:
1. "It can be confusing trying to figure out all of the bills and responsibilities of adulthood. I'm glad you're trying to be mindful of your finances and make responsible choices. Are there any particular questions you have about budgeting or finances?"

2. "It can be challenging to figure out how to best manage your money. Luckily, there are a lot of resources available to help. I can recommend some helpful books or websites, or you could talk to a financial advisor."

3. "It's important to strike a balance between being responsible and living life to the fullest. I remember being in your shoes, feeling like I had to choose between being responsible or having fun. But there's a way to have both! What are some things you like to do for fun?"
