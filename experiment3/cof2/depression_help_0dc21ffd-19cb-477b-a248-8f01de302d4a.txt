USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
How?
To people who have therapist. How do you do it? How are you able to trust them so much that you're able to be vulnerable with them? I don't understand it. I can't even tell my friends how I'm feeling. I can't even tell my parents how I am truly! I really need some help I've been generally getting worse since the day goes by. I've been thinking about doing horrible things to myself and I don't think it's going to stop. I'm afraid I'm going to do something horrible to myself. So tell me how? How are you able to trust them I can't put my finger around it. They're strangers, they can say stuff behind your back! They could even make fun of your trauma behind your back or tell people about it without your permission. So how? I need to know.
