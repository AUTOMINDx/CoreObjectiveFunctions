USER SCENARIO/INQUIRY:
Whatâ€™s one secret you and a parent have kept from the other parental figure?

END SCENARIO

Compassionate professional dialog options to increase prosperity:
1. "The thing about secrets is that they have a way of coming out in the end. It's best to be honest and open with each other, so that you can have a strong relationship based on trust."

2. "Secrets can be damaging to relationships. It's important to be open and honest with each other, so that you can build a foundation of trust."

3. "I'm not sure I'm the best person to talk about this. Why don't you talk to your parent about it? They might be able to give you a different perspective."

4. "It can be difficult to keep secrets from the people we love. Maybe you could talk to a therapist about how to deal with the guilt you're feeling?"

5. "Secrets can be a burden to carry. Maybe you could talk to your parent about it and see if you can get some guidance from them."
