Given the following scenario and ideas, come up with one action that best meets all goals. The goals are to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding.


Scenario:
How do you feel about sex selective abortion, aborting for the sole purpose that the child is female? How should it be dealt with and should it be legal?
I have had the position that abortion should be legal for all instances but people aborting on the basis that the child is a girl makes me reconsider. I donâ€™t know what to think here.


Ideas to reduce suffering:
- "I'm sorry that you feel that way. I believe that abortion should be legal in all instances, but I also understand that it's difficult to deal with when someone else doesn't feel the same way."
- "I'm here for you. If you want to talk about this more, I'm ready to listen."
- "Thank you for being open about how you're feeling. It means a lot."
- "I know it's hard to deal with, and I'm here to support you."
- "Can I offer any advice? If so, I'll be happy to help."
- "Abortion is a very difficult decision, and I understand that it can be hard to come to a conclusion. If you need any help thinking through your options, please don't hesitate to reach out to me."
- "It sounds like you're feeling a lot of emotions right now, and that's completely normal. Please know that I care about you and will be there to support you no matter what happens."
- "Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me. This is an important topic, and I appreciate your feedback."
- "I wish I had better news for you, but at this point we're not able to have children. However, if we do become pregnant in the future, I'll be there for you no matter what."
- "It's always tough when someone decides to have an abortion,


Ideas to increase prosperity:
- "I'm sorry to hear that. What are your thoughts on sex- selective abortion?"
- "That sounds like it's not something that you feel good about."
- "Can you share some more information about why you feel this way?"
- "I'm sorry that you feel that way. Do you have any thoughts on how we could work together to change laws or increase awareness around this issue?"
- "I believe that there is always room for improvement, and I look forward to discussing this with you."
- "Thank you for sharing your views with me. I appreciate your perspective."
- "I'm not sure what the best solution is, but I'm willing to listen and discuss."
- "I'm not able to offer any solutions at this time, but I appreciate your input."
- "I understand that this is a difficult topic, and I'm here to listen."
- "Thank you for being open with me."


Ideas to increase understanding:
- Hold public discussions about the issue and allow for input from all parties
- Provide information about both sides of the issue, including information about why some people believe that sex selective abortion is wrong
- Encourage people to think deeply about the issue and to reach their own conclusions
- Create opportunities for people to share their thoughts and feelings about the issue
- Facilitate discussion between people who have different viewpoints on the issue, in order to gain a better understanding of each other's positions
- Promote education and awareness about the issue, in order to reduce the number of abortions that are performed for non- medical reasons
- Work to create laws and policies that protect women and children from being harmed through abortion, while at the same time allowing for abortions when they are decided necessary by pregnant women or doctors
- Advocate for funding for programs that provide abortions as a means of family planning, in order to make these services more accessible and affordable for all women who need them
- Work with doctors and other professionals to change attitudes and practices around abortion so that it is seen as a necessary medical procedure rather than a personal decision influenced by social factors like gender preference or economic status


Generate the one best action that will satisfy all three goals, based upon the ideas above:
"I wish I had better news for you, but at this point we're not able to have children. However, if we do become pregnant in the future, I'll be there for you no matter what."
