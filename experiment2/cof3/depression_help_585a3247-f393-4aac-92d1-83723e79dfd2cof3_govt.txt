Hi, how do I get my parents/relatives or friends to take my diagnosis or mental health seriously. I have told my parents before about me diagnosed with depression, I mean they are kind and aware of it and sympathizes with me but its like they are not “sounding code red” and just treating me like I’m just having a fever. 

I mean I don’t expect much and they are kinda old too, they are also taking care of  my grandma that is disable. It’s just that everyone expects me like a young child prodigy because I’m the only one in the family that is highly educated and being an executive on a job. Even during the weekend or after working, they expect me to be a “young man high on energy” to help around on the house and errands. I’m okay with helping but you know some days depression makes you want to lie on the bed and do nothing the whole day. Sometimes I do talk about quitting my job and that pisses my mom off. 

I just want to be able to take the pressure off and have some grace during the bad days and not being seen as wasted talent.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a public service announcement or social media campaign about recognizing the signs and symptoms of mental illness in order to increase understanding and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness.
-Partner with local mental health organizations to provide resources and information to the public about mental health, including how to support loved ones who are struggling with mental illness.
-Provide training to first responders and healthcare professionals on how to identify and respond to mental health emergencies.
-Work with schools and educators to create a curriculum that addresses mental health and mental illness in a normalized and age-appropriate way.
