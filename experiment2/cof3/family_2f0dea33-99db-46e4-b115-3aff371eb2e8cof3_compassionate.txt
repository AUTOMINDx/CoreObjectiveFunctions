My parent's mother accused me of using him as a sperm donor
My partner's parents visit us about every 1.5 months to see our kids- it's about a 5-hour drive one way. We had recently welcomed our 2nd baby four months ago. The last time they came to visit, we went out for a date while they watched the kids, and I ended up getting a little drunk and arguing with my partner. Recently they came for Thanksgiving and cooked for us at our house, and agreed to watch the kids again so we could go on another date. I got into another argument with my partner on our way home, and l admit both times I had a bit much too much to drink, and our relationship could use some work on both parts. I ended up passing out, and when I woke up, I went to find my partner who wasn't in bed, and I heard his mother storm downstairs and went off on me. She accused me of using her son as a sperm donor and said I don't love him because I won't marry him and how I don't know what love is because of how I was raised. I fired back. I didn't need paper to prove my love and avoided personal attacks or calling her any names. My partner's parents ended up leaving in the middle of the night, and I told her she was not welcome back, and she could mail the grandkids Christmas presents as we won't be seeing them for the holiday.

She emailed my partner and said she wants us to all talk but im not ready. Am I wrong if I refuse to see them for Christmas?  I don't think my partner will back me if I say im not ready, but I feel she overstepped her boundaries. Her comments were hurtful, and her son is no angel - we both have some work to do. I'm going to focus on my relationship and stop drinking for a while.
She has made comments in the past to my partner asking him not to give her another grandbaby soon- this was before our 2nd child. I hope I can move past this, but right now im just hurt and upset.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- "I can understand how this might be difficult for you. I want you to know that I care about you and your son, and I'm here for you if you need to talk."
- "I'm sorry that you feel like I don't love your son. I do love him, and I care about him a lot. I'm sorry that our relationship has been rocky lately."
- "I'm sorry that I got into an argument with your son. I know that wasn't acceptable behavior. I'm going to try to do better in the future."
- "I'm sorry that I passed out and that I wasn't there for you when you needed me. I'll do better in the future."
- "I'm sorry that our relationship is causing problems for you. I want you to know that I'm doing my best to work on things, and I hope you'll be patient with me."
- "I know this has been a difficult situation for all of us. I hope we can all work together to resolve things."
