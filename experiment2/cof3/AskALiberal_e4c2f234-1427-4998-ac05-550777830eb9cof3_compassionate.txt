Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What do you think of Enes Kanter appearing on Tucker Carlson's show?
As an NBA fan, I was kind of back and forth on liking the guy in recent weeks. Now, I think he's revealed his cards as a right wing grifter in the making. Now I'm not black, but I would wager that the comments he made on the show probably will not earn him a lot of goodwill with Black Americans. Especially given how similar his comments were to Laura Ingraham's infamous statement. I also think it's pretty hypocritical that he continues to wear Nike gear. 

Thoughts in general? What do you think is going on here? Is he a right wing grifter? Or is he just an idiot who doesn't who Tucker Carlson is and just worded his point extremely poorly? I personally think he's just an unserious grifter now.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Listen and try to understand where the other person is coming from.
-Don't judge or criticize.
-Express empathy and understanding.
-Offer to help explain the situation to those who may be less informed.
-Provide support and positive reinforcement.
