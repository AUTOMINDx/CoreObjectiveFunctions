Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Girls in my friend group called me cute and adorable
So my friend group consists of my sibling and her suitemates along with my suitemates (college). Most of the girls in the group have mentioned to me before that I am cute in some shape or form at least once. They also say that I am to other people and friends in the friend group when I am not around. Its based on my personality and looks

It boosted up my confidence like craaazy, but idk if they mean it in a more friendly way because they are suitemates with my sister. I did have a thing for one of them a while ago, so its kinda nice that she called me adorable/cute. 

Any input/advice? Should I even feel negative about this lol?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Encourage positive communication within the group in order to build closer relationships and increase trust. This can be done through group activities, discussion prompts, or simply providing a listening ear.
-Encourage the girls to talk directly to one another about their thoughts and feelings, rather than speaking indirectly about the person they are talking about. This can help to avoid misunderstandings and conflict.
-Help the girls to develop a better understanding of what it means to say something is "cute" or "adorable." This can be done through discussing different interpretations, showing images or videos of adorable animals or children, or providing examples of things that are considered to be cute.
