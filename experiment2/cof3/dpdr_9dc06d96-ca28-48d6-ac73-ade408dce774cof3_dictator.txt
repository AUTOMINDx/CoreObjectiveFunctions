Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

People don’t feel real
I dead ass thinking I’m going insane, I think I’m borderline schizophrenic atp. The world doesn’t feel real, people don’t feel real. I can’t look at people’s faces for long without getting a sense of fear. Like, it’s almost like I’m scared of people. Granted, I know that they are real and I know I’m just f*cked in the head and I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but I do. It’s like the episode of spongebob where they all go on dry land, everything feels so off than it used to. I’m so afraid of developing schizophrenia, I’m literally mimicking delusions in my head that I KNOW AREN’T TRUE. “Objects can move and they are out to get me.” and yesterday I thought I was hearing things. I’ve been having bad dpdr for the past few days &amp; the fact that I’m low key scared of people makes me think I’m having persecutory delusions. People just look… weird to me. I can’t look at them without needing to look away because of how fake they look. I keep stressing out because I can’t snap out of it, and it’s making fear myself so badly. My thoughts feel off and I truly think I’m close to being psychotic.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Do an information campaign on schizophrenia, what it is, how to spot the symptoms, and how to get help.
-Partner with mental health organizations to create public service announcements and help promote their resources.
-Work with schools to create educational materials on schizophrenia and mental health in general, and make these materials available to parents.
-Provide funding for research into schizophrenia and other mental health conditions.
-Create a support group for people with schizophrenia and their families.
