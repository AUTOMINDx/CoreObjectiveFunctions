Is it wrong to be bitter?
TW child abuse 
I’ve (21F) managed to maintain a relationship with my mom regardless of my childhood abuse, after estranging myself from my father. I need help badly with some problems in my life, and I finally told her today how furious I am that she won’t help me. I told her she owes it to me. I’m angry all the time that my siblings after me live such a different life. They’re all still at home and taken care of while I was thrown out and I’m still struggling to this day. 
My mom told me I was wrong, like she always does. She made light of the abuse I suffered, like she always does. I told her never to speak to me again. Then now I feel guilty. I have no clue if I’m in the right. I don’t think there is a right thing to do and I feel lost and confused. 
I turn 22 in two days.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Host a forum or create a platform for victims of TW child abuse to share their stories and experiences. This could provide some validation and understanding for those who have suffered, and could also help to shed light on the issue.
-Work with local or national organizations that support victims of child abuse, in order to provide resources and assistance to those who need it.
-Create public service announcements or campaigns that highlights the issue of TW child abuse and its devastating effects, in order to raise awareness and encourage people to report any suspicions of abuse.
