Immigrant in usa, fluent in english but gets stutter and mind block during interviews
Hello guys. Can u guys give me some advice on this?

Im currently working in California and don't have issues with interview EXCEPT when the company is a big one, during interview i get stutters and mind block. I can barely even speak coherently. Im okay with managers but once I got interviewed by top management (like the COO) I get really flustered and started stuttering. 

I want to get out of being a junior position so I started looking for señior developer positions, i have the technical experience but i always messed up the interview with the top management.  Is there even a chance for me? I have a really good work experience but this is the only road block, i cant seem to get over it.

Also, as an asian, my boss before always comment how nice and soft spoke i am which is bad for a manager or higher position, is what they said.. now I'm worried this will be an issue too and like i said, technical its not a problem.. but how i speak might be a problem.. can u guys give me an idea? I'm ambitious and wouldn't settle for less when I know I have more room to grow. I really want to improve...

Thank u
