Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How do I tell my supervisor I want to quit?
I started grad school in 2019 and I feel stuck and inadequate.
I am not the most systematic person, nor the smartest. Nonetheless, I'm in good terms with my advisor; she trusted me a pretty cool project that aligned with my interests, and she is expecting me to redo and re-submit a grant next April. 

The issue is I've been struggling with everything lately: my proposal is shit, I can't manage my time to get my experiments on a timely manner, I've had a manuscript on hold for a year, my first MS student had a VERY bad experience, and my current MS student is just not getting things done. Furthermore, two years ago I thought getting involved in extracurricular activities would be fun, and now I'm pretty much responsible of a super disorganized student chapter.

I've thought about it and I realized I'm not a good fit for academia at all. I don't have the skills, and I don't have the drive, so I want out.

When do I tell my professor about this? She gave me a bunch of responsabilities and I don't know how to hand them over. Should I tell her about this the day I'm ready to leave? She's paying for my stipend, so I guess the day I tell her will be the last day for my stipend. I'm also going to take vacations in December, so I don't know if I should tell her before leaving, so I don't have to come back.

And probably the most important question: should I tell her on April (right after we submit the grant)? I don't want her to struggle with no one available to write it.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Share their own experiences with quitting or changing careers, if applicable, in order to show understanding and provide a relatable perspective.
-Express empathy for the stress and difficulties the person is experiencing, and acknowledgement of the courage it takes to consider making a change.
-Offer resources or advice on how to communicate the news to one's supervisor or professor, if applicable.
-Remind the person that they are valued and appreciated, even if they decide to leave their current career path.
