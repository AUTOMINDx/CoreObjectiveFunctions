Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[OH] FMLA
I hope this is the right place to post this. This is my first time dealing with this so I apologize for any ignorance. 

I am currently 34 weeks pregnant. I work at a bank. For the last 8 weeks, I had been working from home. My time to return to the branch was 11/22. I put in for my FMLA to begin 11/19. I did this because aside from physical ailment due to my pregnancy, my mental health is also at an all time bottom. I believe work has had a major part in that because of issues with management. 

Well it turns out that my OB says that she still cannot medically excuse me from work. So my leave is set to end on 12/5, and I’d have to refile for maternity leave around mid December since I’m due in January. I have no more time off left. I’ve tried emailing my district manager and see if I can use unpaid time off, which I don’t mind, but he’s still not responded. I will call HR tomorrow, but wanted to know if someone has been through something similar? 

It makes no sense to me to return to work for 2 weeks and then leave again.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Offer words of support and understanding to the individual who is struggling
- Suggest resources or outlets for seeking help with mental health issues
- Encourage the individual to take whatever time they need to get their mental health in order
- Communicate with management to see if any accommodations can be made, within reason
- Advocate for the individual if needed
