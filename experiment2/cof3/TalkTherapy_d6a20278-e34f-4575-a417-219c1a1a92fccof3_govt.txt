Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

The "work" in your language
To those of you who do therapy in a language besides English, do you say "doing the work" like we do in English, or do you use a different word than "work"?

It's always felt weird to me that we refer to the effort and progress in therapy as "work", the same way I talk about my job. Just curious if other languages have a different way of talking about that concept that makes it feel like something different from your employment.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Explore why the term "work" feels weird to some people when discussing therapy and see if there is a better word that could be used in English.
-Research if there are any other languages that have a different way of referring to the effort and progress in therapy, in order to gain a better understanding of why the term "work" might feel foreign to non-native English speakers.
-Organize a focus group or survey to ask people from different backgrounds their thoughts on the term "work" when used in the context of therapy. This could help the government gauge the general consensus on this issue and see if any changes need to be made.
