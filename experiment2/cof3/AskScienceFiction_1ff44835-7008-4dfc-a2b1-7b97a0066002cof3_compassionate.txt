Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[Contact] What technologies or advances arose from building the Machine?
After traveling through the Machine the extraterrestrial being explained that this was just one step in humanity reaching out, and that eventually they would take another.

It would seem like building and operating the Machine introduced some novel concepts, and though the government later disavowed the project, refuted the testimony of Ellie (and the other passengers if we are reading the book) and covered up the event as if it were a hoax, there were hints that they did take it serious if only in secret.

With that in mind what technology or advancements came about after the building of the Machine? How would it lead to the next step?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Share articles or resources about the Machine and its impact.
-Ask open-ended questions about the Machine and what it means for humanity.
-Share personal stories or experiences about times when you felt compassion or understanding was important.
