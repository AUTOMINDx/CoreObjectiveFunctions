Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Instead of dropping money on a new gaming computer that I don't really need, I bought a new camera so I can rediscover an old passion
I've always been the "guy who takes pictures" guy. I got rid of my "nice" camera years ago since it was pretty large and not the best for hiking. I got rid of it and then covid happened... I stopped hiking, stopped camping, started some new jobs, moved a few times. Life happened. 

I bought a lower end gaming pc last year and probably spend too much time on this thing. I was all gung-ho to buy a higher end gaming pc for the higher frames, but instead, I ordered a Fuji X100V camera so that I can rediscover an old hobby that used to define me. 

I think I made the right choice. Can't wait to get out there and take some pictures again.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
- begin or support programs that promote hiking and camping as leisure activities
- provide financial incentives for citizens to engage in outdoor activities as a form of recreation
- create public service announcements or campaigns that encourage people to explore their interests and passions, specifically highlighting how such activities can promote mental and physical health
