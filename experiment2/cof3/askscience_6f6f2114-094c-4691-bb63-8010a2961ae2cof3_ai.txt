Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Are there documented COVID-19 cases linked to surface-to-patient transmission?
Either way, why do many places seem to emphasize surface sanitization and hand washing as opposed to ventilation?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a detailed report on the incidence of COVID-19 cases linked to surface-to-patient transmission and why it is a concern.
-Create an infographic on the benefits of hand washing and ventilation in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
-Publish a blog post or video on the topic to help educate people on the risks of COVID-19 and how to best protect themselves.
