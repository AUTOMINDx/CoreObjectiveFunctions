Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How did nations communicate pre-digital communication.
I'm wondering how nations communicated in the past. Particullary in the middle ages and early middle period. They would have send messengers on horseback to a receiving nation but where did those messengers go to? Did nations in the past have a departement where they could deliver their message? What did countries in the past communicate about; except for declarations of war, alliances or eranged marriages?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create a department specifically for international communication, which would be responsible for delivering messages between nations
-Make archives available to the public so that people can research how nations communicated in the past
-Hold educational lectures and workshops on international communication in order to educate people about the history and strategies of communication between nations
