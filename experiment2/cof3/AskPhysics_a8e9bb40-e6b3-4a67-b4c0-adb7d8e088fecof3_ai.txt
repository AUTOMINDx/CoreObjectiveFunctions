Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Question regarding Fluid Mechanics. Water moving from the outer container to the floating hollow container.
Hi, I have a question regarding fluid mechanics

I just noticed this in the morning. You need a bucket, hot water(relatively), cold water, a hollow container with one opening(like a cup).
When I fill the bucked with cold water and keep the cup on the surface of the water such that the opening boundary(circumference) touches the water such that the water flows from the the bucket of water to the cup without pushing the cup constantly. Leave the cup like that for about 50-60 seconds and water would flow from the bucket to the cup until the cup stablises and its circumference does not touch the surface of water anymore. After that the cup stablises and attains equilibrium.

It is not random, I carried out the experiment thrice and I have the same amount of water in the cup at the end. When I try this experiment with hot water, the water in the cup when it attains equilibrium is less as compared to cold water. I know that this is something related to archimedes principle, upthrust and floatation. I want to know why does the cup always stablize at the same amount of water in the cup and also why does the circumference of the cup move away from the surface of water when it has sufficient water in it. The level of the water always stays the same in the hollow container and the bucket.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research the principles behind Archimedes' Principle and fluid mechanics to better understand the underlying mechanisms at work
-Generate a video explaining the experiment and its results in a way that is easy to understand for people with no background in fluid mechanics
-Write a blog post detailing the experiment and its results, adding in commentary on the significance of the findings
