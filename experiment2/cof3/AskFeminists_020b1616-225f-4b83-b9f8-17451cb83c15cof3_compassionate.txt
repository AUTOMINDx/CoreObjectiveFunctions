Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Whats your thoughts on the mens rights movement?
Eddit to correct an error: with mens rights movement I didnt mean MRM but as an umbrella term for groups that want to solve mens problems


I mean the non extreme mens rights so not women hating/mens surpremacy movement

Cause it looks like a loot of people think you can either be a Feminist or a mens rights activist and that these two groups have to fight each other while in reality these two movements could fight together for a lot of things supporting each other instead of hateing and hindering one another

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Explain that there are different types of men's rights groups, and that not all of them are hateful or misogynistic.
-Emphasize that both feminist and men's rights activists want equality for all, they just have different ideas about how to get there.
-Encourage open discussion and listening to both sides, in order to better understand the complex issues at play.
