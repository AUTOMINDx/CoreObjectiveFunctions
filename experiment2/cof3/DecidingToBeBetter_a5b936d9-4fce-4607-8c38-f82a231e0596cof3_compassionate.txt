Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Instead of dropping money on a new gaming computer that I don't really need, I bought a new camera so I can rediscover an old passion
I've always been the "guy who takes pictures" guy. I got rid of my "nice" camera years ago since it was pretty large and not the best for hiking. I got rid of it and then covid happened... I stopped hiking, stopped camping, started some new jobs, moved a few times. Life happened. 

I bought a lower end gaming pc last year and probably spend too much time on this thing. I was all gung-ho to buy a higher end gaming pc for the higher frames, but instead, I ordered a Fuji X100V camera so that I can rediscover an old hobby that used to define me. 

I think I made the right choice. Can't wait to get out there and take some pictures again.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Acknowledge that both the gaming pc and the camera are financial investments, and that both have the potential to bring joy
- Ask about the person's old passion for photography and why it was important to them
- Express excitement for the person's upcoming journey back into photography
