Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[IL] New position, hourly to salary, no contract?
I recently took a new position within the same company. It's a move up the ladder within a new department with a new boss. I am currently hourly but this will be a salary position. The payrate was given to me in an hourly form though. I start tomorrow but have signed no contract, etc. When I reached out to the HR recruiter a week ago to see what needed to be done, I was told to just get a new badge with my new title. I feel like there needs to be more than this though?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-The government could create an online resource that explains the differences between hourly and salary positions, and why some employers choose to pay employees differently. This could help to clear up any confusion and ensure that both employees and employers are aware of the expectations and benefits of each type of position.
-The government could work with employers and employees to develop standards for paying employees in salary positions. This could include minimum and maximum pay rates, as well as guidelines for benefits and other compensation. This would help to ensure that both employers and employees are treated fairly, and that employees are given the proper benefits for their position.
