Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Finally got a rheumatology referral.
I've been to my normal doctor over and over the last two years with frequent respiratory illness, going to a GI and a pulmonary specialist, and after coming in about joint inflammation and pain, I got a referral!

I just hope this is close to me finding the answers to my issues, but I'll find out soon enough.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- "It sounds like you've been through a lot of different specialists to try and find an answer to your problems. I hope this new specialist can help you find some answers."
- "I know it can be frustrating not knowing what is wrong with you and waiting for test results. I'll be keeping you in my thoughts."
