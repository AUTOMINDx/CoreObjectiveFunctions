Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Do other people get legitimately turned on by intelligence or am I just a freak?
I don't fucken know what's wrong with me. I've heard many people say, obviously, that they value or need intelligence in their partner to be compatible. Lots of people say that they're a "sapiosexual" because they find it attractive when someone is smart. But does this actually mean that you are actively turned on by someone doing complex mathematics with ease? Lol. I've always felt this way, but just now started to reflect and possibly compare this experience to that of others. Does anyone else get horny at people calculating the magintude of vectors, etc.? It's pretty absurd, but at least it's not a creepy kink lmao.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create a public service announcement campaign that discusses the different ways that people can be turned on, and how there is no wrong or right way to feel.
-Host town hall meetings or panels to discuss the topic of sapiosexuality and how it manifests in different people.
-Launch a social media campaign that allows people to share their experiences with being sapiosexual, and opens up a dialogue about the topic.
