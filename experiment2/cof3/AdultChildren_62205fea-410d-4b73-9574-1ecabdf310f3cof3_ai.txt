Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Mom just went for the second time to the ER because of alcohol
She hasnâ€™t eaten in days and only lies in bed and drinks. Came home for thanksgiving and had lean cuisine for dinner. 

Now I have to wait until the early morning hours to pick her up. I have to drive home tomorrow. 

Fuck the holidays.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Talk to mom about her alcohol consumption and why she may be engaging in this behavior. Is she feeling overwhelmed or stressed? Is there something else going on that the AI could help with?
-Explore different methods of support for mom, such as therapy, medication, or a support group.
-Stay in close communication with mom to ensure she is getting the support she needs, and offer additional support if necessary.
-Encourage other family members to talk to mom about her alcohol consumption and offer their support.
-Provide resources to help mom manage her stress and alcohol consumption.
