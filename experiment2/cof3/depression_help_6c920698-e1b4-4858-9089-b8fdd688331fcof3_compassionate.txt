Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Please help. I can't deal with these extreme mood swings.
I tried to stay positive for a couple of days. It helped. We got a dog today and i was super happy.

The moment i start feeling a bit sad i hate myself more and get negative thoughts and in the end it suddenly turns into the feeliing of killing myself. Please help. Do i try to stay away from all negative thoughts again ?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- "I'm here for you. I understand how difficult it can be to deal with mood swings, and I want to help you through this."
- "Thank you for sharing this with me. It must be very difficult to carry this burden by yourself."
- "How can I help you feel better? What do you need from me?"
- "It sounds like you're really struggling right now. I'm here for you, whatever you need."
