Advice on what should I say
Couple of days ago a friend of mine told me he is in bad time of his life and that he don't want to play. When I asked he said it was a talk for some other day, started suspecting he has some bad illness or someone he knew died. Later I found out he has an alcoholic mother, father out of the equation. Now dumb me said what a relief thinking I might lose him or something like that. Later realized wasn't the smartest thing to sayðŸ˜¥

Do anyone have any idea of what I should tell him next time we talk? I have no idea how bad he feel and need your advice.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-You must be going through a really tough time. 
-I'm here for you, if you ever want to talk about it. 
-Is there anything I can do to help you? 
-It sounds like you're carrying a lot of stress and burden. I'm here to help shoulder that load, if you let me. 
-This is a lot to handle, and I'm here for you.
