Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Are there documented COVID-19 cases linked to surface-to-patient transmission?
Either way, why do many places seem to emphasize surface sanitization and hand washing as opposed to ventilation?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Share accurate information about COVID-19 and surface-to-patient transmission
-Ask questions to better understand the situation and why some places are emphasizing surface sanitization and hand washing
-Express concern and compassion for those who are impacted by COVID-19 and those who are working to prevent its spread
