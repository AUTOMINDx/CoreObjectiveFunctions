Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Is inverted or shifted qualia possible?
Basically my question is this - do we see colors the same way (and for that matter do we feel emotions, pain, temperature, hear sounds the same way etc)?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
- Hold a town hall meeting to discuss the possibility of inverted or shifted qualia and answer any questions that residents may have.
- Create an information pamphlet about inverted or shifted qualia that can be distributed to residents.
- Have experts available to answer residents' questions about inverted or shifted qualia.
