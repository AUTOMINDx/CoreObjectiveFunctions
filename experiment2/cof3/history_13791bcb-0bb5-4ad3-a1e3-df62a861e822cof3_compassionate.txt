Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How did nations communicate pre-digital communication.
I'm wondering how nations communicated in the past. Particullary in the middle ages and early middle period. They would have send messengers on horseback to a receiving nation but where did those messengers go to? Did nations in the past have a departement where they could deliver their message? What did countries in the past communicate about; except for declarations of war, alliances or eranged marriages?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Ask questions to better understand the scenario
-Share personal stories or experiences that are relevant to the situation
-Offer practical help or support
-Listen with compassion and understanding
