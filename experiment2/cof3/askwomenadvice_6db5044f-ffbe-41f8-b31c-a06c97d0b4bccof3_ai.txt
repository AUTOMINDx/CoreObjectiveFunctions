Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone have hair loss or very fine hair? Afraid to date.
Unfortunately I have quite severe hair loss but I have curls so itâ€™s easy to hide it because I can just pull it up in a bun. 

I have never been in a relationship before but once I move out, I will try to put myself out and start dating. That being said, I wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar predicament?

Thanks!

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
- generate a support group for people with hair loss or very fine hair, to provide them with a safe space to discuss their experiences and feelings;
- create an online forum or blog where people can share tips and advice on how to cope with hair loss or very fine hair;
- produce educational materials about hair loss and very fine hair, for both adults and children, that can be used to raise awareness and understanding of these conditions.
