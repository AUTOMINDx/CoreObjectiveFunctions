Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Is proton decay more or less accepted or decidedly not going to happen?
I've seen videos about iron stars that suggest proton decay will not occur, but at the same time I believed it was only natural for all things to "decay" as entropy increases.  What is the currect mindset held by the scientific community... will we get mass stockpiles of unfusable iron or a world without stars?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold public meetings to discuss proton decay and what it means for the world
-Have experts explain proton decay in terms that are easy to understand for the average person
-Create informational materials about proton decay that can be shared online and in print
-Make proton decay research easily accessible to the public
