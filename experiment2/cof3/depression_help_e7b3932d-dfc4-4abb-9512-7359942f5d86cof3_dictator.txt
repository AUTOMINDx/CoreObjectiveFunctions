Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Trying to be supportive through a really tough time?
My fiancÃ© is a very unlucky man this year. Iâ€™m really worried for his mental health since his best friend (unvaccinated) caught covid, and his dog of 10+ years is ill and has an open wound that keeps bleeding. Heâ€™s not had a lot of pets and the few heâ€™s had he kept for a long time, so heâ€™s taking the dog thing really hard. (The friend is in a toxic relationship so itâ€™s hard for him to get the friend to listen to him on vaccine stuff)

As for me, Iâ€™m just incredibly depressed cuz itâ€™s my first time working through the holiday season in retail, my room is a pigsty, Iâ€™m having reoccurring headaches (of which I suspect to be migraines), Iâ€™m failing school on grants, I want to listen to my fiancÃ©â€™s advice and go home when Iâ€™m feeling unwell but I need the money (to pay my parents back, tune up car, save to see him, pay off student loans, and get new laptop) and Iâ€™ve already been talked to twice about absences (one of which was a write up). Oh and did I mention I feel as though my workplace is screwing me over on pay, but Iâ€™ve gotta find the proof first? Not fun. 

I feel selfish just saying all my shit. He says to say it anyways and that heâ€™ll be there for me, but he knows how I get, and I donâ€™t want him to have to worry about me as well as all that shit heâ€™s got going on.

I didnâ€™t tell him today but with the store as busy as it was in Black Friday (if not a bit more) and my headache tearing away at my brain cells from the start of my day up until now, I wanted to kill myself. I want so badly for this feeling to go away, or at the very least, hide away until dog and best friend stuff is sorted. I just want him to be happy ðŸ’”

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create/support a program that encourages people to talk about their stressors and offers support. This program could also offer resources for people struggling with suicidal thoughts.
-Create/support a program that encourages people to get regular mental health checkups.
-Featuring articles or personal essays from people who are struggling with different issues (mental health, Covid, etc) on the dictator's official website/social media pages. This could help to humanize the people impacted by these situations and help others to understand their struggles.
