Mom just went for the second time to the ER because of alcohol
She hasnâ€™t eaten in days and only lies in bed and drinks. Came home for thanksgiving and had lean cuisine for dinner. 

Now I have to wait until the early morning hours to pick her up. I have to drive home tomorrow. 

Fuck the holidays.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Express concern for all those involved, and indicate a desire to help in any way possible
- Ask questions to gain a better understanding of what is happening and why
- Offer support and sympathy to those affected
- Promote patience and understanding during a difficult time
