Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How did nations communicate pre-digital communication.
I'm wondering how nations communicated in the past. Particullary in the middle ages and early middle period. They would have send messengers on horseback to a receiving nation but where did those messengers go to? Did nations in the past have a departement where they could deliver their message? What did countries in the past communicate about; except for declarations of war, alliances or eranged marriages?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Perhaps the dictator could create a department where messages between nations could be delivered, in a similar way that the postal service operates. This would help to improve communication between nations and could help to prevent misunderstandings.
-The dictator could also establish rules and regulations for how nations should communicate with each other. This would ensure that all communications are carried out in an appropriate and respectful manner.
