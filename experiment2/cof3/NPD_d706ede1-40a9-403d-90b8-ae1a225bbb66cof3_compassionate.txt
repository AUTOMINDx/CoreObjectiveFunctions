What keeps you alive?
I am an empty vessel, somehow loved by the people around me, although I can’t really feel it. I don’t really know what purpose I serve and I don’t want to be here and keep being reminded of my nothingness. Feels like I’m counting my days…

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Express your understanding for how the person is feeling 
-Share your own experiences with feeling emptiness or purposelessness 
-Ask the person how they want to spend their days and offer any support you can in that goal 
-Remind the person that they are loved and appreciated by the people around them 
-Share quotes or scriptures that offer hope or comfort
