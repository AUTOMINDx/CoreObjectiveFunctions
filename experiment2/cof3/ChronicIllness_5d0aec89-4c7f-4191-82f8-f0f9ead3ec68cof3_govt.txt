Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Finally got a rheumatology referral.
I've been to my normal doctor over and over the last two years with frequent respiratory illness, going to a GI and a pulmonary specialist, and after coming in about joint inflammation and pain, I got a referral!

I just hope this is close to me finding the answers to my issues, but I'll find out soon enough.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-compassionately communicate with the individual about the referral and diagnosis process
-continuously communicate with the individual about the treatments and progress made
-provide clear and concise explanations about the illness and treatments for all impacted parties
