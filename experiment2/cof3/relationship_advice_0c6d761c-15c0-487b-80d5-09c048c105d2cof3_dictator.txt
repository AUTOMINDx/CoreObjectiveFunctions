Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

The honeymoon phase is over and I'm wondering if I should call it quits? (28F, 30M)
I've been dating my guy for 2 years.  (28F, 30M).  Up until the last 6 months or so, things were pretty good, albeit a few issues here and there.  Lately, things have just staled out.  He doesn't try to plan or cook nice stuff together anymore when I come over, doesn't plan any activities ahead, is alright just communicating with me via text most of the time and doesn't bother to send words of affirmation (my love language) anymore.  If I go over, he doesn't bother to dress nice or even comb his hair half the time.  I just feel a total lack of effort all around and I'm growing bored.  I personally like reading self improvement, I've asked him to try reading some of the books, and he doesn't want to.  I try to set workout schedules and things like that while he doesn't bother to workout.  He just lacks motivation in life and I guess it spills over into the relationship as well.  He said he doesn't plan his life too far ahead either, so we have no plans to move in together, build a life together, etc.  We live day to day.  Why do I stay?  I'm not sure.  Fear of being alone maybe and I still love him.  He makes me laugh and I do enjoy being with him when we are actually hanging out (which is rare now due to conflicting work schedules) I see he makes effort here and there, but I just feel like he takes me for granted now and doesn't care enough anymore, doesn't tell me he loves me anymore either.   He still answers all my calls, is willing to work things out, acts loving when we are together, etc.  but the relationship is missing spice and he seems to be content with that...

I'm wondering if we are just incompatible and if I should just end it before I become too old to find a suitable partner again.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a list of activities and things to do that both partners enjoy and make an effort to do these things together
-Talk about why self improvement is important and brainstorm ways the couple can help motivate each other to stay healthy and be productive
-Explore why the partner feels content living day-to-day and brainstorm ways to make long-term plans together
-Communicate more effectively through verbal and written communication, noticing and addressing any issues as they come up
