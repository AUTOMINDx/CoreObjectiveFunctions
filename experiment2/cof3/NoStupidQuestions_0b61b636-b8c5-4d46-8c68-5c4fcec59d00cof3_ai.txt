Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Is it safe to smoke marijuana in the same room as a cat
If i’m hitting a bong in the same room as a cat, is it entirely unsafe for the kitty? My best friend is thinking of adopted an elderly kitty (one that has been in the shelter for a longggg time) but she is only renting out a singular room. She can go in the whole house but she’d rather keep the cat in her room only just so she knows it’s safe and that her niece won’t mess with it or anything. However she also tends to smoke weed in her room pretty regularly (she bought a really nice air purifier because of how frequent lol). As long as she doesn’t blow any smoke in the cats direction is that okay? Like out the window or on a different side of the room? If it’s not safe she can smoke in a different room.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Look into studies that have been conducted on the effects of marijuana smoke on cats.
-If no studies have been conducted, the AI could reach out to experts on the matter to gain a better understanding of the risks involved.
-Consider ways to create a safe environment for the cat, such as smoking outside or in a different room.
