Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Is inverted or shifted qualia possible?
Basically my question is this - do we see colors the same way (and for that matter do we feel emotions, pain, temperature, hear sounds the same way etc)?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold town hall meetings to discuss the concept of inverted or shifted qualia and answer questions from the community.
-Create informational pamphlets about inverted or shifted qualia that can be distributed to the community.
-Work with local schools to create lesson plans about inverted or shifted qualia that can be taught to students.
-Host online forums and discussion groups about inverted or shifted qualia where people can ask questions and share their thoughts and experiences.
