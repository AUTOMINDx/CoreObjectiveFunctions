I’m looking to switch to a data analyst career path.  I have free access to LinkedIn Learning. Are there any courses you’d recommend?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
- Hold a town hall meeting to answer any questions residents may have about the change in career path for the individual.
