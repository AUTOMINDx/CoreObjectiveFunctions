Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

I wish I could go back in time and change that one single decision that caused me to spiral into severe anxiety
Everyday for months now I kept worrying about this one thing I did and how much I regretted it. I kept catastrophizing it thinking that it’s gonna lead to more and more bad things in the future and I’m terrified but there’s nothing I can do to change it and I just want to slap my younger self. I keep telling myself it’s not that big of a deal but a part of me keep thinking that it’s going to butterfly effect into a disaster. Nothing happened yet but at this rate, I might die of anxiety if the bad outcome actually come true because I am loosing my shit. I think it’s because I can’t accept that I fucked up and I can’t even blame anyone because it’s on me and it feels impossible to forgive myself. It feels like I’m the only one who is fucking up. The worst part was that it wasn’t even a big deal but I made it into this shitty situation.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-The AI could generate a simulation of how the situation could have played out differently if the decision had been different, in order to help the individual understand the consequences of their decision.
-The AI could provide a support forum for people who are struggling with guilt or regret, in order to provide a community of people who understand what they are going through.
