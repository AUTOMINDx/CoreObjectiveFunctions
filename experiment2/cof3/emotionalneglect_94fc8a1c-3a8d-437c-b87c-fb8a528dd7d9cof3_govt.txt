Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

{rant} mom-memes on fb are my personal hell
I wish I could post a picture, but y’know those mom memes they post on Facebook? My mom sends me one every now and then but this last one really sent me… I don’t know why in particular. Just these empty platitudes, it really makes me feel like I’m in an alternate reality where I’m making everything up and I’m the problem, a bratty ungrateful child who decided not to talk to my parents one day out of the blue. A screenshot of text on a gradient background, “Maybe I’m different but having children is a lifetime commitment…” is the main idea of the post. “Always come HOME!” That’s the part that really gets me feral. Come home! HA! Every time something is hard I have to come home and everything will be fixed, apparently. Blehhhh I’m too tired to go into everything but hi, how are y’all doing today?

Edit: sorry if this is a double-post, just realized I may have posted this accidentally in another sub so I’m putting this here but delete if that’s the case lmao

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate public awareness campaigns about the dangers of unquestioned obedience to authority figures, especially when those figures are one's parents.
-Create materials that help children better understand and navigate the fraught dynamics of their familial relationships.
-Provide support services for individuals who struggle with strained relationships with their parents.
