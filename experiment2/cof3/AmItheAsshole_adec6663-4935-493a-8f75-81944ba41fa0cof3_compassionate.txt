AITA for telling my stepdaughter that vampires aren’t real?
I (M32) married my wife (F24) a year ago, and I have a stepdaughter (F5). Before we got married, the three of us went out to dinner, and my now-stepdaughter got to eat steak. At the end of the meal, she started licking the meat juice from the plate. I told her to stop, but my now-wife told me to let her be.

Later that night, my wife explained to me that my stepdaughter has had problems in the past with picky eating. My wife was worried that she wasn’t getting enough protein, and decided on a creative way to explain the importance of getting enough protein. Specifically, she decided to tell my stepdaughter that they were vampires, and that she would die if she didn’t get enough blood. Because my stepdaughter is a child, she believed my wife and started eating whatever meat was put in front of her. My wife was also able to use the vampire thing to convince her to eat tomatoes, beets, and other red vegetables.

I thought this seemed cute and creative until today, when my stepdaughter got suspended from Kindergarten. She bit another child on the neck, apparently in an attempt to drink his blood. When she and my wife got home, I overheard her explaining that my stepdaughter needs to be a “nice vampire who doesn’t bite.” I thought that was a little ridiculous.

Later, I saw my stepdaughter petting and kissing my dog’s neck. I freaked out, scared she was about to bite my dog (she claimed she was just petting him). I told her to go to her room, where I explained that vampires aren’t real and that her mom lied to her. She immediately burst into tears and ran to my wife.

My wife is pissed off at me for making her daughter cry and “overriding her parenting.” Maybe I did, but the situation was clearly getting out of hand, and I thought it was best to just stop lying to her. My wife says that she had things under control, and that the vampire lie is no different from lying about Santa. Still, something had to be done. AITA?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-It sounds like you were trying to help your stepdaughter eat more healthily by convincing her that vampires need to drink blood to survive.
-Perhaps it would be better to find a different way to help her eat more protein, such as by cooking meals that include red meat and vegetables.
-It’s understandable that you got upset when you saw your stepdaughter petting your dog, as you may have misinterpreted her actions.
-It’s possible that your stepdaughter was just petting your dog and didn’t have any intention of biting him.
-It’s also possible that your stepdaughter is pretending to be a vampire because she’s attracted to the idea of being powerful and different.
-Your wife could talk to her stepdaughter about why pretending to be a vampire is dangerous and could lead to her getting in trouble at school.
