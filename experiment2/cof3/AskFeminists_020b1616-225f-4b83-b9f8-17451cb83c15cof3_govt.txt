Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Whats your thoughts on the mens rights movement?
Eddit to correct an error: with mens rights movement I didnt mean MRM but as an umbrella term for groups that want to solve mens problems


I mean the non extreme mens rights so not women hating/mens surpremacy movement

Cause it looks like a loot of people think you can either be a Feminist or a mens rights activist and that these two groups have to fight each other while in reality these two movements could fight together for a lot of things supporting each other instead of hateing and hindering one another

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-hold public forums or debates to discuss and air different perspectives on the issue
-create informational pamphlets/videos/websites that provide an overview of the movement and its goals, as well as the key arguments and concerns of those who support it and those who oppose it
-sponsor or fund research on the effects of the movement on society and individual men and women
-encourage constructive dialogue and open communication between those who hold differing viewpoints on the issue
