Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Instead of dropping money on a new gaming computer that I don't really need, I bought a new camera so I can rediscover an old passion
I've always been the "guy who takes pictures" guy. I got rid of my "nice" camera years ago since it was pretty large and not the best for hiking. I got rid of it and then covid happened... I stopped hiking, stopped camping, started some new jobs, moved a few times. Life happened. 

I bought a lower end gaming pc last year and probably spend too much time on this thing. I was all gung-ho to buy a higher end gaming pc for the higher frames, but instead, I ordered a Fuji X100V camera so that I can rediscover an old hobby that used to define me. 

I think I made the right choice. Can't wait to get out there and take some pictures again.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a list of activities the individual was passionate about before losing interest, and recommend those activities to the individual in an effort to help them reconnect with what makes them happy.
-Suggest contacting friends or family members who may have shared the individual's old passion for photography, in an effort to create a support network that can encourage and help the individual return to their hobby.
