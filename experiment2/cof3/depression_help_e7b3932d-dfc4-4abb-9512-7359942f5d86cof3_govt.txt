Trying to be supportive through a really tough time?
My fiancÃ© is a very unlucky man this year. Iâ€™m really worried for his mental health since his best friend (unvaccinated) caught covid, and his dog of 10+ years is ill and has an open wound that keeps bleeding. Heâ€™s not had a lot of pets and the few heâ€™s had he kept for a long time, so heâ€™s taking the dog thing really hard. (The friend is in a toxic relationship so itâ€™s hard for him to get the friend to listen to him on vaccine stuff)

As for me, Iâ€™m just incredibly depressed cuz itâ€™s my first time working through the holiday season in retail, my room is a pigsty, Iâ€™m having reoccurring headaches (of which I suspect to be migraines), Iâ€™m failing school on grants, I want to listen to my fiancÃ©â€™s advice and go home when Iâ€™m feeling unwell but I need the money (to pay my parents back, tune up car, save to see him, pay off student loans, and get new laptop) and Iâ€™ve already been talked to twice about absences (one of which was a write up). Oh and did I mention I feel as though my workplace is screwing me over on pay, but Iâ€™ve gotta find the proof first? Not fun. 

I feel selfish just saying all my shit. He says to say it anyways and that heâ€™ll be there for me, but he knows how I get, and I donâ€™t want him to have to worry about me as well as all that shit heâ€™s got going on.

I didnâ€™t tell him today but with the store as busy as it was in Black Friday (if not a bit more) and my headache tearing away at my brain cells from the start of my day up until now, I wanted to kill myself. I want so badly for this feeling to go away, or at the very least, hide away until dog and best friend stuff is sorted. I just want him to be happy ðŸ’”

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold town hall meetings to provide information to the public and answer any questions they may have
-Create a website or social media platform specifically devoted to providing information and answering questions about Covid-19
-Put together a team of experts to provide one-on-one consulting to those who need it
