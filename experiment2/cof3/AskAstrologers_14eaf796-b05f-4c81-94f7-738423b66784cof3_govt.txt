Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Can there be more optimism?
I keep reading posts about the United States Pluto Return and most of them can be very fear mongering. I’ve seen people say we may want to flee the country, that we’re gonna be poor, and that it’s going to be terrible. Doesn’t help when you have severe anxiety. :/ I know we don’t know what’s going to happen, and this is their opinion, but I’m tired of seeing all the doom and gloom when talking about this Pluto return. :( Many people aren't able to move out of the country, so hearing that we should flee, or that we're gonna go through a very catastrophic time can be so scary. Sorry if this is an annoying post, I’m not trying to tell others how they should speak on certain things, I just wanna hear some more optimistic takes on it than negative and fear mongering.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
- Hold town hall meetings and/or online forums to discuss the Pluto return and what it could mean for the country and its citizens.
- Use public service announcements or social media platforms to communicate with the public about the Pluto return and its potential impacts.
- Provide information on how to access mental health services if people are feeling overwhelmed or anxious about the Pluto return.
- Encourage people to stay informed, but also to be mindful of the amount of news and information they are consuming. It can be helpful to take breaks and focus on positive things in life to maintain a healthy mindset.
