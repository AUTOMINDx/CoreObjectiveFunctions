How do I stop feeling like I don't have enough money?
For the record, I don't make a lot. But I'm also not broke. I make enough to live frugally and then some. I just don't have enough because I'm a new Yorker, so that means I pay high taxes and spent easy too much on food and rent. I always feel I need to be working, and seeing those around me also be busy, makes me want to work as well. Given this, how do I stop feeling like i need to work all the time.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a list of articles and resources on spending and saving money.
-Offer financial advice and tips on how to save money.
-Provide a forum for people to discuss their financial concerns and strategies.
-Create a budgeting tool that helps people track and manage their expenses.
