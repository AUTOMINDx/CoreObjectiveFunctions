Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone have hair loss or very fine hair? Afraid to date.
Unfortunately I have quite severe hair loss but I have curls so itâ€™s easy to hide it because I can just pull it up in a bun. 

I have never been in a relationship before but once I move out, I will try to put myself out and start dating. That being said, I wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar predicament?

Thanks!

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
- Hold a public forum to discuss hair loss and dating, seeking input from both people with hair loss and those who date them
- Create a website or online resource with information about hair loss and dating, including personal stories
- Produce a short video about hair loss and dating that can be shared online
- Urge people with hair loss to reach out to each other for support and advice
