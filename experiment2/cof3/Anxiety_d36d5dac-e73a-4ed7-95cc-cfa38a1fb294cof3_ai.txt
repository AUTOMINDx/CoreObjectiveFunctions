Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Panic attacks and fight or flight
Whenever my sister visits I know I’ll get panic attacks because she knows all my triggers and so does my brother. I try real hard not to overreact to their attitudes but it is impossible to control. I go into fight or flight mode real bad and it is scary. They did everything possible to remove me from Thanksgiving. My family yells at me whenever I get like this and it only gets worse. Then my sister always says that I need to be hospitalized and this only happens when she’s around. I go literally insane because she knows how to make me this way. My sister in law even shoved me the night before when no one was around and I did not engage but then no one believed me. My meltdown was because of all the pent up anger I had from all the mean things they did to me. My sister brainwashed my mom and my other sister into thinking that I’m insane. It shocks me, because she has a kid that has severe ADHD and she lets that kid get away with everything. I’m a lot younger than my siblings. Oh and my sister in law vandalized my car a few months ago. I never harm anyone! I always try to avoid them as much as possible.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a detailed psychological profile of all individuals involved, which could help to identify triggers and areas of conflict.
-Work to create a more positive and supportive environment for the person with panic attacks, which could help to reduce the intensity and frequency of attacks.
-Helping the family to understand the condition and how to best support their loved one.
-Provide mediation and conflict resolution services to help the family communicate more effectively and reduce the tension and aggression.
