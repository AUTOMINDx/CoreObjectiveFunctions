How do I stop feeling like I don't have enough money?
For the record, I don't make a lot. But I'm also not broke. I make enough to live frugally and then some. I just don't have enough because I'm a new Yorker, so that means I pay high taxes and spent easy too much on food and rent. I always feel I need to be working, and seeing those around me also be busy, makes me want to work as well. Given this, how do I stop feeling like i need to work all the time.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
- Hold workshops and talks on financial literacy and budgeting.
- Facilitate group discussions on the pressures of working too much and ways to find more leisure time.
- Help people get connected to affordable city programs and services that can help them save money on rent and groceries.
