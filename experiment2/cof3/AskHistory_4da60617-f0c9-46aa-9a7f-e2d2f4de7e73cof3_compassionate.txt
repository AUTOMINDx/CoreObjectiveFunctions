Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Were Abolitionists in the United States inspired by the Haitian Revolution and other nations that abolished slavery?


Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Framing the question in a way that does not assign blame can be helpful in getting people to open up and share their thoughts and feelings. For example, "Can you tell me more about why you think that?" or "What are your thoughts on abolitionists in the United States?"
-Allow for and encourage open dialogue. Recognize that different people may have different opinions, and that is okay. 
-Show empathy and be respectful of everyone involved.
