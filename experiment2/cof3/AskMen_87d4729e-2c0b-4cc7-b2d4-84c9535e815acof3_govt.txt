Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Fellow men, how do you shop?
Me: 

Step 1: Decide what I want to buy.

Step 2: Walk into the store. 

Step 3: Eliminate everything I definitely won't be buying in 5 minutes. 

Step 4: Eliminate everything I won't buy from whatever's left. 

Step 5: At this point there isn't really anything left so I pick whatever I haven't crossed out. 

Total time taken: 7 minutes. 9 if I'm particularly interested.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Step-by-step guides on how to shop for various items, with images and videos to help illustrate the process
-Plans to hold regular shopping events with representatives from the government and the private sector to help people learn about shopping
-Creation of an online resource where people can ask questions about shopping and receive answers from experts
