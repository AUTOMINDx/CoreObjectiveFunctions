Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What are your thoughts on this video, regarding the hypocrisy of liberal legislatures (and their voters too)? How can we get out of this deadlock from both sides?

In this,  Johnny Harris and Binya Appelbaum talk about  why famously liberal states like California and Washington struggled to advance progressive policies - even when they control the legislature (though they still manage to blame the republicans); this happens partly because of voters, but there is great reluctance of behalf of democrats themselves to put their programs into practice. 

 

So, what do you think? Is there a progressive path forward (maybe through the likes of AOC)?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Work to build bridges between people with different political viewpoints in order to create understanding and empathy.
-Collaborate with legislators in these states to help progressive policies be put into practice.
-Generate data and research on the effects of progressive policies in order to help inform the voting public.
