Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Can I ask for advice on how to come out to my dad here?
Sorry if I offend anyone with my terminology, labels and what not that is not my intention at all I’m just trying to ask a question about coming out and my understanding of everything relating to the other parts of the LGBTQ+ community besides the trans community is severely lacking and even that is not great, I just wanted to say sorry again if I unintentionally offend someone. I feel like I am so much better communicating when I’m talking then writing and even when I’m talking I still muddle my thoughts. 

So, I am a 24 year old trans girl/woman whichever you like, who is pre everything but would very much like to change that. But, I currently live at home with my fairly conservative dad who while accepting of my sister being Bi, Lesbian, or Queer (sorry but she’s not here for me to ask but I know she Identifies as one of those). But he has said to me about trans people that if that’s what they need to do to be happy then it’s not his life so he doesn’t get a say. He also has said to my sister that if that’s something you need to do to be happy then do it but go all the way as in get bottom surgery (which is something I’m kinda on the fence about) but he said it in a way where he wasn’t really thinking about it if that makes sense, they were talking about politics and caitlyn jenner came up and my sister asked about if one of us was transgender for me but she thinks he was on a roll talking about politics and just kinda said something and moved on. So, neither my sister or I really know where he stands if I came out as trans. 

I want to say I have a friend online who just came out as trans to their parents and the parents aren’t taking it well and then ask how he would react if my sister or I was trans but I don’t know how to even start that conversation and I also really don’t want to raise suspicion anymore then they probably all ready are as it seems like he’s starting to suspect something is up but knowing him he could just think I’m going to fail my classes or just not do as well in them as he would like. 

Sorry I know this is a lot but I’m freaking out a little bit but I also want to lose a lot of weight before starting HRT because supposedly HRT won’t redistribute fat that is already there but will with new fat but I just looked it up and it might redistribute current fat but the consensus is your mileage may very so who knows. 

Thank you for your any advice and help

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a list of resources for the person asking for help, including articles, videos, and books on coming out as LGBTQ+, transgender, and/or their experiences with family members.
-Put together a support group for people who are coming out as LGBTQ+ or transgender, either in person or online.
-Create a blog or website that provides information and resources for LGBTQ+ people, families members of LGBTQ+ people, and allies.
-Organize workshops and/or support groups for parents of LGBTQ+ children.
-Work with local schools to create a curriculum on LGBTQ+ history and/or experiences.
