Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Instead of dropping money on a new gaming computer that I don't really need, I bought a new camera so I can rediscover an old passion
I've always been the "guy who takes pictures" guy. I got rid of my "nice" camera years ago since it was pretty large and not the best for hiking. I got rid of it and then covid happened... I stopped hiking, stopped camping, started some new jobs, moved a few times. Life happened. 

I bought a lower end gaming pc last year and probably spend too much time on this thing. I was all gung-ho to buy a higher end gaming pc for the higher frames, but instead, I ordered a Fuji X100V camera so that I can rediscover an old hobby that used to define me. 

I think I made the right choice. Can't wait to get out there and take some pictures again.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
- Share articles or videos about the benefits of spending time on old hobbies
- Host a meet-up or social media group for enthusiasts of the hobby to share their work and tips
- Give financial incentives for people to spend time on old hobbies (tax breaks, matching funds, etc)
