Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How do I stop feeling like I don't have enough money?
For the record, I don't make a lot. But I'm also not broke. I make enough to live frugally and then some. I just don't have enough because I'm a new Yorker, so that means I pay high taxes and spent easy too much on food and rent. I always feel I need to be working, and seeing those around me also be busy, makes me want to work as well. Given this, how do I stop feeling like i need to work all the time.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
- Hold workshops and informational meetings to educate people on topics such as budgeting, managing finances, and the cost of living in major cities.
- Create resources (information pamphlets, websites, videos, etc.) on these same topics to make them easily accessible to the public.
- Offer financial counseling and/or mentorship programs to help people manage their money and budget more effectively.
- Conduct research on the psychological effects of taxation and financial pressure, and make this information available to the public.
- Work with advocacy groups and lobby for policy changes that would help to ease the financial burden on citizens.
