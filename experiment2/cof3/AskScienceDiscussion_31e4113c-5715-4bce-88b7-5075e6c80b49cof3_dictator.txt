Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Is proton decay more or less accepted or decidedly not going to happen?
I've seen videos about iron stars that suggest proton decay will not occur, but at the same time I believed it was only natural for all things to "decay" as entropy increases.  What is the currect mindset held by the scientific community... will we get mass stockpiles of unfusable iron or a world without stars?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
- Hold a town hall meeting or panel discussion on the topic of proton decay, with a focus on answering questions from the community
- Create an educational website or video series on proton decay that is easy to understand and entertaining for all ages
- Encourage scientific research on proton decay in order to better understand the phenomenon
