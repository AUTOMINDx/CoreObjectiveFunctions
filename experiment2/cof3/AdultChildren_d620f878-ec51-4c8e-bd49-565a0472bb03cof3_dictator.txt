Advice on what should I say
Couple of days ago a friend of mine told me he is in bad time of his life and that he don't want to play. When I asked he said it was a talk for some other day, started suspecting he has some bad illness or someone he knew died. Later I found out he has an alcoholic mother, father out of the equation. Now dumb me said what a relief thinking I might lose him or something like that. Later realized wasn't the smartest thing to sayðŸ˜¥

Do anyone have any idea of what I should tell him next time we talk? I have no idea how bad he feel and need your advice.
