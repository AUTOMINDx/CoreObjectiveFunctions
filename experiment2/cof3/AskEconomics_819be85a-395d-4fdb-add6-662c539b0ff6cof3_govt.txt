Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What is the optimal policy for strategic industries?
Economists generally frown upon protectionism because of the inefficiencies and deadweight loss it creates. However, some industries are vital for national defense capability. They provide an intangible economic benefit to a nation that is not reflected in prices. In the event of a war, production capacity in these industries can be shifted for wartime production. Examples include:

* Steel and other metals
* Automotive and other manufacturing
* Aircraft manufacturing
* Shipbuilding
* Merchant marine
* Semiconductors

How should economists take strategic value into account when calculating possible trade benefits?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
- Create an educational campaign on the benefits and importance of strategic industries.
- Work with economists to create a model that better reflects the strategic value of certain industries.
- Hold public hearings to get feedback from the public on the best way to support strategic industries.
