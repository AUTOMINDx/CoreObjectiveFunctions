Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Medications ?
I am currently on lamictal and although it helps my mood sometimes I wonder if they are better options out there. What meds do you guys take that help with the terrible symptoms that we suffer with, does anyone take lamictal too or combine it with another med?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Compile a list of medications and their side effects, as well as any interactions with other medications, and make this list available to the public.
-Hold information sessions on different medications and their side effects, for both the public and health care professionals.
-Create a website or app that can provide information on different medications and their side effects, including how to manage any side effects.
