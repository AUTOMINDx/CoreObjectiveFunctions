Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

{rant} mom-memes on fb are my personal hell
I wish I could post a picture, but y’know those mom memes they post on Facebook? My mom sends me one every now and then but this last one really sent me… I don’t know why in particular. Just these empty platitudes, it really makes me feel like I’m in an alternate reality where I’m making everything up and I’m the problem, a bratty ungrateful child who decided not to talk to my parents one day out of the blue. A screenshot of text on a gradient background, “Maybe I’m different but having children is a lifetime commitment…” is the main idea of the post. “Always come HOME!” That’s the part that really gets me feral. Come home! HA! Every time something is hard I have to come home and everything will be fixed, apparently. Blehhhh I’m too tired to go into everything but hi, how are y’all doing today?

Edit: sorry if this is a double-post, just realized I may have posted this accidentally in another sub so I’m putting this here but delete if that’s the case lmao

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create a survey for people who post these types of memes, in order to better understand what emotions they are trying to convey and why.
-Generate a bot that replies to these memes with resources and information on how to communicate with parents, or how to seek help if needed.
-Create a blog or website that collects these memes with explanations for why they might be harmful, and offers resources for people who need help.
