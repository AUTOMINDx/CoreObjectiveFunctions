Please help. I can't deal with these extreme mood swings.
I tried to stay positive for a couple of days. It helped. We got a dog today and i was super happy.

The moment i start feeling a bit sad i hate myself more and get negative thoughts and in the end it suddenly turns into the feeliing of killing myself. Please help. Do i try to stay away from all negative thoughts again ?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-If possible, try to talk to the person experiencing the mood swings to gain a better understanding of what might be causing them. This could help the AI to better support the person in question.
-Create a safe, supportive environment for the person to express their feelings and emotions. This could help to reduce some of the negative thoughts and feelings they may be experiencing.
-Provide resources and information on ways to deal with mood swings and other mental health issues. This could help to provide the person with the tools they need to manage their mood swings.
