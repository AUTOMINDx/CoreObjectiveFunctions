Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Starting therapy at an OCD treatment center and I'm extremely nervous.
I've been in therapy for years for ptsd, and BPD, but recently reached out to an OCD center since where I have been going doesn't have an OCD specialist. The treatment I've done has helped with my ptsd and bpd a lot but my OCD is now my primary concern. I'm worried treatment here could cause me to backslide or lead to something bad happening. If I hadn't made so much progress and wasn't so scared of how I was before my progress I don't think it would be a problem. Has anyone here had OCD specialized therapy? Is it intimidating?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-conduct an information campaign on OCD and its treatments;
-provide online resources with information on OCD and its treatments;
-provide a helpline for people with OCD and their families for additional support;
-run support groups for people with OCD and their families to provide them with a sense of community and support.
