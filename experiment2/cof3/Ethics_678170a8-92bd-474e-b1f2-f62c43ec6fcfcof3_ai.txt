Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Filling an ethically questionable job if I am committed to making it better than someone else would?
Hi everyone. Need advice.

I'm interviewing for a job that I find ethically questionable, to say the least. Think salesman for company that provides, among its products, very high interest rate loans for people with low credit.

However, I feel that I'm in a position to demand a veto against any egregious products. In other words, in my mind, taking this job would mean that fewer people would get sucked into harsh loan cycles than if I forego the job and let someone else take it who is less concerned with this ethical issue.

I think I know the answer here... Just help me understand why I shouldn't take the job.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Develop a detailed ethical analysis of the implications of taking the job, considering all potential outcomes.
-Talk to people who have experience in similar positions and get their perspectives on the ethical implications.
-Talk to people who have been affected by high-interest loans and get their perspectives on the ethical implications.
-Consider creating a tool or resource that can help people make ethical decisions in difficult situations.
