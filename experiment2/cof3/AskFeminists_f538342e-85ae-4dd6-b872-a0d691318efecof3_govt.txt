In this,  Johnny Harris and Binya Appelbaum talk about  why famously liberal states like California and Washington struggled to advance progressive policies - even when they control the legislature (though they still manage to blame the republicans); this happens partly because of voters, but there is great reluctance of behalf of democrats themselves to put their programs into practice.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold public forums and discussions to help citizens understand the complexities of the policy decisions being made.
