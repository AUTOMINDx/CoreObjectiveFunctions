Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How did the Ottoman Empire survive its fratricide law?
In 1451 Mehmet II codified a law that bade the Sultans after him to kill their brothers after they ascend to the throne to prevent civil war. This law remained in place until Ahmed I's reign in the early 17th century, over 150 years later. How did the Ottomans not only survive, but expand during this period? Wouldn't the ability of a Sultan to legally murder his brothers only add to the likelihood of a civil war and dynastic infighting, since the brothers would find it in their best interest to preemptively rebel against/usurp the Sultan before he had them executed?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- explore how the Ottoman Empire functioned as a society and what factors may have led to their success despite the fratricide law
- discuss the implications of the fratricide law and how it may have impacted the daily lives of Ottoman citizens
- ask questions about how the fratricide law may have impacted relationships within families and the Sultan's ability to govern effectively
