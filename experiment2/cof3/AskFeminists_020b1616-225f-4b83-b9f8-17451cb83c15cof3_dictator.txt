Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Whats your thoughts on the mens rights movement?
Eddit to correct an error: with mens rights movement I didnt mean MRM but as an umbrella term for groups that want to solve mens problems


I mean the non extreme mens rights so not women hating/mens surpremacy movement

Cause it looks like a loot of people think you can either be a Feminist or a mens rights activist and that these two groups have to fight each other while in reality these two movements could fight together for a lot of things supporting each other instead of hateing and hindering one another

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold public debates between proponents of each movement, to help people understand the different viewpoints and why people hold them
-Work to dispel myths and misinformation about both movements, in order to help people make informed decisions
-Provide education on gender issues and how they intersect with other social issues, in order to help people understand the complex nature of these issues
