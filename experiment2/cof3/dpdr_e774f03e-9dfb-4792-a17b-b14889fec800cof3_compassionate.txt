Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Medications ?
I am currently on lamictal and although it helps my mood sometimes I wonder if they are better options out there. What meds do you guys take that help with the terrible symptoms that we suffer with, does anyone take lamictal too or combine it with another med?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Share personal experiences with medication, both good and bad.
-Ask questions about medications and how they help.
-Share information about different medications and their side effects.
-Offer support and understanding for those who are taking medications, whether they are effective or not.
