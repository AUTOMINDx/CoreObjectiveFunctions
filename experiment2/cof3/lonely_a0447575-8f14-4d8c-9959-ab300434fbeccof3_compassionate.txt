Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Most of the time I'm glad that I don't have to worry about checking my phone/replying to people. But sometimes... I miss having that someone to chat nonsense with.
From the little daily nonsense stuff to the big philosophical things. Having someone to chat with, but on a deeper connection than just a friend, is something I miss so much. 

I guess I'll just go back to listening to podcasts to pretend I'm part of something.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create a space for the individual to share their thoughts and feelings about what they're experiencing.
-Empathize with the individual and express that you understand how they feel.
-Offer support and encouragement to the individual.
-Suggest ways that the individual can connect with others, such as attending social events or joining a club.
