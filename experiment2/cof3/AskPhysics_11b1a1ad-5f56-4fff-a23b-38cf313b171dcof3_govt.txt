Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What are some good software resources (i.e. apps) that would be useful going into a physics/maths degree?
I'm not really talking about textbooks and stuff just other online tools that would be useful (such as latex I've heard). Also one more follow up question, will iPad pro be good to run this stuff?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
- Create a list of resources that are available to help people understand the concepts being studied in physics and mathematics
- Make these resources easily accessible on government websites and social media platforms
- Provide funding for research and development of new tools and technologies that can help people understand physics and mathematics concepts (including apps and software)
- Collaborate with educators and experts to develop learning materials that can be used by people of all ages and abilities
- Encourage people to share their own experiences and tips for learning physics and mathematics concepts
