Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Did the literate folks in medieval have individual names memorized for all or most days of the year? Could you refer to events as happening on any Saint's feast day and expect to be understood?
Barbara Tuchman mentions that dating events as "Two days before the nativity of the virgin, or the Monday after epiphany, or St. John the Baptist's day, or the third Sunday in Lent."

Did they do this because it was actually understandable, or because they wanted to put things in religious context?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create public calendars that list important dates and events.
-Make sure that important information (e.g. school holidays, major national holidays, etc.) is properly communicated to the public in a timely manner.
-Utilize mass communication methods (e.g. radio, television, internet, etc.) to ensure that the widest possible audience is reached.
