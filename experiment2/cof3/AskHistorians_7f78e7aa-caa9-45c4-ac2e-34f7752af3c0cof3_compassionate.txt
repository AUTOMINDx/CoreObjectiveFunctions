Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Did the literate folks in medieval have individual names memorized for all or most days of the year? Could you refer to events as happening on any Saint's feast day and expect to be understood?
Barbara Tuchman mentions that dating events as "Two days before the nativity of the virgin, or the Monday after epiphany, or St. John the Baptist's day, or the third Sunday in Lent."

Did they do this because it was actually understandable, or because they wanted to put things in religious context?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Try to use more specific and concise language when referencing dates and events.
-Explain why it might be important for some people to specifically date events in this way.
