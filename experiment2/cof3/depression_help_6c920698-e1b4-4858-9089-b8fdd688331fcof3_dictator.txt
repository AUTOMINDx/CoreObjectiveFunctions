Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Please help. I can't deal with these extreme mood swings.
I tried to stay positive for a couple of days. It helped. We got a dog today and i was super happy.

The moment i start feeling a bit sad i hate myself more and get negative thoughts and in the end it suddenly turns into the feeliing of killing myself. Please help. Do i try to stay away from all negative thoughts again ?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-create safe spaces for people to openly talk about their feelings and experiences with mood swings, without judgement
-provide education and resources on mental health and mood swings, in a way that is accessible and relatable for all ages
-create campaigns or initiatives that promote self-care and positive mental health
-create support groups or forums for people who are struggling with mood swings to connect with one another and receive support
