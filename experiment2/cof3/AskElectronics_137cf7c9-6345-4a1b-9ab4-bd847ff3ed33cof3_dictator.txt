Kester 50/245 vs 44
I am looking to buy good quality solder wire, I am looking at [Kester 50/245](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00068IJOU/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_2?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&amp;psc=1) and [Kester 4](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00068IJWC/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_3?smid=A2T6WH6GHC7Q1&amp;psc=1)4.

First of all, Why does Kester 50/245 have two codes 245 and 50 ?

Secondly, Which one should I go for ? is there a significant difference between the two ? Both of them do not require cleaning ? for game controller/console repair and DIY audio kits, which one should I go for ?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create a table that compares the different features of each solder wire
-Make a video explaining the differences between the two solder wires
-Write an article explaining the differences between the two solder wires
