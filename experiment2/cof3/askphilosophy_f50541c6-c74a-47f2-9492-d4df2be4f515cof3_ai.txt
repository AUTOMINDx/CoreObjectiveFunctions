Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Is inverted or shifted qualia possible?
Basically my question is this - do we see colors the same way (and for that matter do we feel emotions, pain, temperature, hear sounds the same way etc)?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research different ways that people experience colors, emotions, pain, temperature, and sounds.
-Compare and contrast the different ways that people experience these things.
-Discuss the implications of different ways of experiencing these things.
