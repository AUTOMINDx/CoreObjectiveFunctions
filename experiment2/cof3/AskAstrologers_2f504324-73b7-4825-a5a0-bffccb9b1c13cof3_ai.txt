Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What advice would you give a younger person with your same sun and moon sign?
Greetings, astrologers.
Since weâ€™re in ask astrologers, I was wondering what advice you would give a younger person with your same sun/moon sign based on your own life experiences and astrological knowledge!

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Ask questions to gather more information about the person's sun and moon sign and personal experiences
-Generate a report with personalized advice based on the person's sun and moon sign
-Hold a discussion forum where people can share their experiences and advice with others
