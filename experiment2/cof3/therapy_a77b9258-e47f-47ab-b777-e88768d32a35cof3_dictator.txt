Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

I am too scared to go to therapy. I feel like if I go and tell the truth I will be fucking sent straight to prison or the therapist will call God himself on me. are my fears founded on nonsense or am I right?
my friends have been telling me to go to therapy because I have very dark thoughts and extremely poor mental health but I feel that

If I say the things that I think about and the things that bother me the therapist will see me as a monster and kick me out or something

one time I went to a counsellor before and she just kinda stood there in silence and was ljke

Maybe you should take some medication

but I think counsellors are different from therapists? 

I dont know who else to go to because my thoughts are extremely gross and violent and depressing and I don't want to Thi k them but I always do.


Also I don't want to have the polie called on me or sent to a mental hospital

am I being paranoid?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Encourage people to talk openly about mental health and therapy, promoting the idea that it is okay to seek help and that there is no shame in doing so.
-Make it clear that therapy is confidential, and that the therapist will not tell anyone about what is said in sessions unless the client gives permission.
-Provide resources for people who are struggling with mental health issues, such as information on where to find therapists and how to access medication if needed.
-Create a safe space for people to discuss their thoughts and feelings without judgement, where they can explore their concerns without fear of retribution.
