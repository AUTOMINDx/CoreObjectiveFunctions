Kester 50/245 vs 44
I am looking to buy good quality solder wire, I am looking at [Kester 50/245](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00068IJOU/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_2?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&amp;psc=1) and [Kester 4](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00068IJWC/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_3?smid=A2T6WH6GHC7Q1&amp;psc=1)4.

First of all, Why does Kester 50/245 have two codes 245 and 50 ?

Secondly, Which one should I go for ? is there a significant difference between the two ? Both of them do not require cleaning ? for game controller/console repair and DIY audio kits, which one should I go for ?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Start by explaining the difference between the two codes- 50/245 vs. 44- and why there might be confusion.
-Take the time to explain the difference in quality between the two solder wires, and how that might impact the final product.
-Offer advice on which solder wire would be best for their specific needs, and explain why.
-Stay patient and understanding, and be prepared to answer any further questions that may come up.
