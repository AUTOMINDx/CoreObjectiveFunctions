Please help. I can't deal with these extreme mood swings.
I tried to stay positive for a couple of days. It helped. We got a dog today and i was super happy.

The moment i start feeling a bit sad i hate myself more and get negative thoughts and in the end it suddenly turns into the feeliing of killing myself. Please help. Do i try to stay away from all negative thoughts again ?
