Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Whats your thoughts on the mens rights movement?
Eddit to correct an error: with mens rights movement I didnt mean MRM but as an umbrella term for groups that want to solve mens problems


I mean the non extreme mens rights so not women hating/mens surpremacy movement

Cause it looks like a loot of people think you can either be a Feminist or a mens rights activist and that these two groups have to fight each other while in reality these two movements could fight together for a lot of things supporting each other instead of hateing and hindering one another

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Do research on the history and goals of both movements, as well as the arguments of their respective proponents
-Organize a public forum or debate in which representatives from both movements can discuss their beliefs and listen to the arguments of their opponents
-Create educational materials (articles, videos, infographics, etc.) that explain the goals and values of both movements, as well as the historical and contemporary debates surrounding them
