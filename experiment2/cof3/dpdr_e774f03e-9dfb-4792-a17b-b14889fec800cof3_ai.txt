Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Medications ?
I am currently on lamictal and although it helps my mood sometimes I wonder if they are better options out there. What meds do you guys take that help with the terrible symptoms that we suffer with, does anyone take lamictal too or combine it with another med?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research different medications and their effects on people with bipolar disorder.
-Share information about different medications with people who are affected by bipolar disorder.
-Provide information about the benefits and risks of different medications to help people make informed decisions about their treatment.
