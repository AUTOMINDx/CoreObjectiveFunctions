I feel hated by ppl..
I'm agoraphobic and feel hated and mistreated by people. Not even my own parents or grandparents. I was never ever their favourite first.. the only 1 that truly loved me was my aunt.. but other than that I'm very hated by people and I want to die. I'm unemployment and still staying in this toxic relationship he says to me I havent worked for 4 years roasting me on pure heartache he knows that it hurts me very bad that I'm unemployed

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
- Hold public meetings or forums to discuss the situation and allow for public input.
- Create informational resources on agoraphobia and anxiety disorders, available both in print and online.
- Work with local mental health professionals to create resources and facilitate support groups for those affected by agoraphobia and anxiety disorders.
- Advocate for accessible and affordable mental health care.
- Collaborate with local charitable organizations to develop programs to provide assistance to those affected by agoraphobia and anxiety disorders.
