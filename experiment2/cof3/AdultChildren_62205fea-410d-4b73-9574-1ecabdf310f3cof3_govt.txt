Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Mom just went for the second time to the ER because of alcohol
She hasnâ€™t eaten in days and only lies in bed and drinks. Came home for thanksgiving and had lean cuisine for dinner. 

Now I have to wait until the early morning hours to pick her up. I have to drive home tomorrow. 

Fuck the holidays.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a public service announcement or social media campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of alcohol abuse, especially during the holidays
-Arrange for transportation for the individual to and from the ER so that family members do not have to worry about driving home
-Offer support services to the individual and family members to help them cope with the situation
