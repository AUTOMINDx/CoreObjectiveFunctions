Is it wrong to be bitter?
TW child abuse 
I’ve (21F) managed to maintain a relationship with my mom regardless of my childhood abuse, after estranging myself from my father. I need help badly with some problems in my life, and I finally told her today how furious I am that she won’t help me. I told her she owes it to me. I’m angry all the time that my siblings after me live such a different life. They’re all still at home and taken care of while I was thrown out and I’m still struggling to this day. 
My mom told me I was wrong, like she always does. She made light of the abuse I suffered, like she always does. I told her never to speak to me again. Then now I feel guilty. I have no clue if I’m in the right. I don’t think there is a right thing to do and I feel lost and confused. 
I turn 22 in two days.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Understand and acknowledge the range of emotions that the person is feeling, including anger, frustration, and guilt.
-Offer support and understanding, and explore any possible ways to help the individual work through their feelings.
-Remind the person that it is okay to feel all of these emotions, and that they are not wrong for feeling this way.
-Encourage open communication, and provide a listening ear for anyone who needs to talk.
