Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

My parent's mother accused me of using him as a sperm donor
My partner's parents visit us about every 1.5 months to see our kids- it's about a 5-hour drive one way. We had recently welcomed our 2nd baby four months ago. The last time they came to visit, we went out for a date while they watched the kids, and I ended up getting a little drunk and arguing with my partner. Recently they came for Thanksgiving and cooked for us at our house, and agreed to watch the kids again so we could go on another date. I got into another argument with my partner on our way home, and l admit both times I had a bit much too much to drink, and our relationship could use some work on both parts. I ended up passing out, and when I woke up, I went to find my partner who wasn't in bed, and I heard his mother storm downstairs and went off on me. She accused me of using her son as a sperm donor and said I don't love him because I won't marry him and how I don't know what love is because of how I was raised. I fired back. I didn't need paper to prove my love and avoided personal attacks or calling her any names. My partner's parents ended up leaving in the middle of the night, and I told her she was not welcome back, and she could mail the grandkids Christmas presents as we won't be seeing them for the holiday.

She emailed my partner and said she wants us to all talk but im not ready. Am I wrong if I refuse to see them for Christmas?  I don't think my partner will back me if I say im not ready, but I feel she overstepped her boundaries. Her comments were hurtful, and her son is no angel - we both have some work to do. I'm going to focus on my relationship and stop drinking for a while.
She has made comments in the past to my partner asking him not to give her another grandbaby soon- this was before our 2nd child. I hope I can move past this, but right now im just hurt and upset.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
- Provide emotional support for the individuals involved
- Suggest counseling or therapy to help resolve any underlying issues
- Mediate a meeting between all parties to discuss the situation and come to a resolution
- Offer to babysit so the parents can have some time alone to discuss things
- Help to rebuild the relationship between the parents and grandparents
