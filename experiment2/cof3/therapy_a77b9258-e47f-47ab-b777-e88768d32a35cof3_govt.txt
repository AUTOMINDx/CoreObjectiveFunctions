Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

I am too scared to go to therapy. I feel like if I go and tell the truth I will be fucking sent straight to prison or the therapist will call God himself on me. are my fears founded on nonsense or am I right?
my friends have been telling me to go to therapy because I have very dark thoughts and extremely poor mental health but I feel that

If I say the things that I think about and the things that bother me the therapist will see me as a monster and kick me out or something

one time I went to a counsellor before and she just kinda stood there in silence and was ljke

Maybe you should take some medication

but I think counsellors are different from therapists? 

I dont know who else to go to because my thoughts are extremely gross and violent and depressing and I don't want to Thi k them but I always do.


Also I don't want to have the polie called on me or sent to a mental hospital

am I being paranoid?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Work to create a safe space for those impacted by mental health issues to come forward and share their experiences without fear of judgment or retribution.
-Create campaigns or public service announcements to educate people on the realities of mental health, what to do if they are worried about a friend or loved one, and the importance of seeking help.
-Provide funding for and promote access to therapy and other mental health services.
-Increase resources available to those struggling with mental health issues, including medication, therapy, and support groups.
