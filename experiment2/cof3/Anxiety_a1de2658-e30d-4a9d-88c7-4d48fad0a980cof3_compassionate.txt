I wish I could go back in time and change that one single decision that caused me to spiral into severe anxiety
Everyday for months now I kept worrying about this one thing I did and how much I regretted it. I kept catastrophizing it thinking that it’s gonna lead to more and more bad things in the future and I’m terrified but there’s nothing I can do to change it and I just want to slap my younger self. I keep telling myself it’s not that big of a deal but a part of me keep thinking that it’s going to butterfly effect into a disaster. Nothing happened yet but at this rate, I might die of anxiety if the bad outcome actually come true because I am loosing my shit. I think it’s because I can’t accept that I fucked up and I can’t even blame anyone because it’s on me and it feels impossible to forgive myself. It feels like I’m the only one who is fucking up. The worst part was that it wasn’t even a big deal but I made it into this shitty situation.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Offer words of understanding and sympathy, letting the person know that you feel for them and understand what they are going through
- Help the person to see that while what they did may have been a mistake, it is not indicative of their entire character, and that they are still worthy of love and respect
- Suggest seeking out counseling or therapy, which can help to explore the emotions and thoughts around the situation and offer tools for managing them
- Encourage the person to do some self-care, such as exercise, journaling, or relaxation techniques, which can help to manage stress and anxiety
