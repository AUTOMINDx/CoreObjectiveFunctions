Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How do you back out of plans you agreed to doing?
Some of my friends and I had planned to go to a holiday event on Saturday. Even though we had made these plans weeks ago I am just not feeling up to going anymore. The event is over an hour away from my home and it doesn't seem like something I want to do now. I would rather do something else instead, like just go out to dinner. One of my other friends feels the same way and she is hoping someone else will cancel. But I feel like just being direct and telling our friends now- rather than wait until the last minute- that I no longer can make it. At the same time I don't want to come across as a flake. Any advice on what a good reason would be not to go?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-When making plans, be upfront about any reservations or hesitations that you may have. If something comes up and you can no longer attend an event, be honest and let your friends know as soon as possible.
-It can be difficult to cancel plans, but sometimes it is the best thing to do. If you have a good reason for cancelling, let your friends know why. This will help them understand and may even garner some sympathy.
