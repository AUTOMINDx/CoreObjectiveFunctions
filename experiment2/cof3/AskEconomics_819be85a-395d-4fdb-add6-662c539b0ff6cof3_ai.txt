Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What is the optimal policy for strategic industries?
Economists generally frown upon protectionism because of the inefficiencies and deadweight loss it creates. However, some industries are vital for national defense capability. They provide an intangible economic benefit to a nation that is not reflected in prices. In the event of a war, production capacity in these industries can be shifted for wartime production. Examples include:

* Steel and other metals
* Automotive and other manufacturing
* Aircraft manufacturing
* Shipbuilding
* Merchant marine
* Semiconductors

How should economists take strategic value into account when calculating possible trade benefits?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research the effects of protectionism on strategic industries and calculate the possible benefits.
-Make an interactive infographic or video explaining the benefits of strategic industries and protectionism.
-Write an article or blog post on the subject.
-Hold a forum or debate on the benefits of strategic industries and protectionism.
