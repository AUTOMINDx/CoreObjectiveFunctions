Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Anyone else controlled their whole life not allowed to be a kid, teen or young adult and treated as an adult their whole life but "that never happened" and they have legally completely made up fictional stories in their head
Ie my mom stated insisting lately (im 31) she wishes I went away to college and got to experience it and she wanted that for me but when I was 16/17 we never spoke ONCE about college and she didn't help me do anything, from applying, trying to get scholarships or applying foe financial aid, I literally went and registered on my own at 17 to a cuny college one day after school,  the only thing she said after high school was that I wasn't allowed to go away and I had to stay home because she would miss me and not to make her worry.  I dropped out after 6 months because I couldn't handle working full time in retail with changing schedules every week that interfered with school and I couldn't quit work I literally wouldn't be able to eat or have transportation 

But is anyone else's narc like this,  like she genuinely believes this delusion in her head and I don't remember and I only wanna remember bad things about her.  

Another example is me and my brother came home a few times threatening to call cps on her and"she told the bastards go ahead and gave us the phone" and how it's worse in foster care and we'd be sorry,  this is her telling other people while I was there and heard her,  and we "did it a few times and learned" , again this never happened and is literally a completely fabricated story its insane, she'll hear dramatic stuff and I feel she wished happened to her and twists it in her head that it really happened to her she does this with a lot but these are 2 recent ones

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create a therapist position in the government that is available to citizens for free.
-Offer financial incentives for citizens to attend therapy.
-Provide more resources for mental health education.
-Increase funding for mental health research.
