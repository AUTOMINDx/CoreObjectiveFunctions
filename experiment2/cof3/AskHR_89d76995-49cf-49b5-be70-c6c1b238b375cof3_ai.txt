Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[IL] New position, hourly to salary, no contract?
I recently took a new position within the same company. It's a move up the ladder within a new department with a new boss. I am currently hourly but this will be a salary position. The payrate was given to me in an hourly form though. I start tomorrow but have signed no contract, etc. When I reached out to the HR recruiter a week ago to see what needed to be done, I was told to just get a new badge with my new title. I feel like there needs to be more than this though?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
- Clarify expectations and job duties early on, in order to avoid any confusion or miscommunication.
- Have a meeting with the new boss to discuss the transition and get to know them better.
- Touch base with HR to make sure everything is in order and that there are no surprises waiting for the new employee.
