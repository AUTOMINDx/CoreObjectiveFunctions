Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

A conversation I had with the nurse at my gyno's office when I requested an appointment. I do not have an IUD...


Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Educate people on the different types of birth control and their individual benefits and drawbacks
-Make IUDs more readily available, with information on their lower failure rate
-Make appointments for people to discuss birth control options with a nurse or physician
-Create commercials/marketing campaigns that illustrate the benefits of different birth control options
-Offer subsidies for IUDs or other long-term birth control options
