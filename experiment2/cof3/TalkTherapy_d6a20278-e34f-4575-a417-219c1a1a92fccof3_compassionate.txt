Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

The "work" in your language
To those of you who do therapy in a language besides English, do you say "doing the work" like we do in English, or do you use a different word than "work"?

It's always felt weird to me that we refer to the effort and progress in therapy as "work", the same way I talk about my job. Just curious if other languages have a different way of talking about that concept that makes it feel like something different from your employment.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Speak to the idea of how therapy can be hard work, but also be very rewarding
-Ask other therapists if they have a different term for what we call 'work' in therapy, to get a sense of how it feels to them
-Share your own experiences with therapy and how it has helped you
