Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

The "work" in your language
To those of you who do therapy in a language besides English, do you say "doing the work" like we do in English, or do you use a different word than "work"?

It's always felt weird to me that we refer to the effort and progress in therapy as "work", the same way I talk about my job. Just curious if other languages have a different way of talking about that concept that makes it feel like something different from your employment.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research the equivalent words/phrases used in other languages to refer to the work done in therapy
-Compare and contrast the ways that the concept of "work" is understood in different languages
-Explore the implications of using different words to describe the work done in therapy
