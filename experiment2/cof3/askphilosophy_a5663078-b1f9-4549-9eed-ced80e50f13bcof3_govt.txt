Kants letter to Herz
Hi guys, 

They deleted my question for some reason so I try asking it here. 

In the letter that Kant writes to Marcus Herz, he claims that there is some sort of problem that he had been ignoring, which he tries to solve in the letter. Anyway, it took him about 9 years to come to a solution. I was trying to understand what exact problem he was facing that was so hard to answer but I don’t seem to get it.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create a more in-depth summary of the letter, including the problem that Kant was trying to solve
- hold educational events or discussions that explore the ideas presented in Kant’s letter
- provide supplemental materials that explore the concepts in more depth
- translate Kant’s letter into multiple languages to make it more accessible to a wider audience
