Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Why isn’t there a good and popular alternative to YouTube?
Especially with the corporate takeover it’s experiencing (RIP dislike button), mixed with a general disregard for its user base, demonetization of essentially any video not “family friendly”, and all around censorship. 

Why isn’t there a more free and open platform that puts its content creators first? I can see people eating this up especially if the creators of the site execute it well. 

I mean the bar is pretty low at this point.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Make a website or app that is similar to YouTube, but with less censorship and more freedom for content creators.-Encourage people to use this new platform as an alternative to YouTube.
