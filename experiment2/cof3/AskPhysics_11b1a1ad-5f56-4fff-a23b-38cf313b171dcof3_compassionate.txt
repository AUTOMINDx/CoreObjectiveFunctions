Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What are some good software resources (i.e. apps) that would be useful going into a physics/maths degree?
I'm not really talking about textbooks and stuff just other online tools that would be useful (such as latex I've heard). Also one more follow up question, will iPad pro be good to run this stuff?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Why do you want to go into physics/maths?
- What do you like about physics/maths?
- What do you think you will find most challenging in physics/maths?
- What resources do you have to help you prepare for physics/maths?
- What do you think would be the biggest challenge in using software resources to help you with physics/maths?
- What are your thoughts on the iPad pro for physics/maths?
