Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Filling an ethically questionable job if I am committed to making it better than someone else would?
Hi everyone. Need advice.

I'm interviewing for a job that I find ethically questionable, to say the least. Think salesman for company that provides, among its products, very high interest rate loans for people with low credit.

However, I feel that I'm in a position to demand a veto against any egregious products. In other words, in my mind, taking this job would mean that fewer people would get sucked into harsh loan cycles than if I forego the job and let someone else take it who is less concerned with this ethical issue.

I think I know the answer here... Just help me understand why I shouldn't take the job.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Explain why the job is ethically questionable and how it could impact people in a negative way
-Ask the person if they would be comfortable vetoing any egregious products
-Discuss the impact of the job on their conscience and how they would feel about themselves if they took it
