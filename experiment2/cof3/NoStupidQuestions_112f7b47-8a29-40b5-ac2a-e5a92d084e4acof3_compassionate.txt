Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Why isn’t there a good and popular alternative to YouTube?
Especially with the corporate takeover it’s experiencing (RIP dislike button), mixed with a general disregard for its user base, demonetization of essentially any video not “family friendly”, and all around censorship. 

Why isn’t there a more free and open platform that puts its content creators first? I can see people eating this up especially if the creators of the site execute it well. 

I mean the bar is pretty low at this point.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Start a dialogue about the situation and what people feel about it
-Listen to the concerns of others and offer empathy
-Show support for those who are upset about the situation
-Promote other platforms that people can use
