Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

The History on Movies and TV Shows
About a one and a half year ago I traced a timeline with a lot of movies and TV Shows to give to my students a way to watch while on this pandemic period since the online classes are somehow uninteresting to them.

Unfortunately, I lost that list and I’m working on a brand and improved new one, which when finished I’ll place here on Reddit so everyone can use. Even this pandemic period ending, I got some really good results with it and think it’s relevant to the community, not just the academic but to everyone

I remember to put the Troy movie and TV Show, followed by Spartacus. Vikings followed by The Last Kingdom. The White Queen followed by The White Princess, then The Tudors and The Borgias then The Virgin Queen for this period of 1400~1600. Also I remember to have dated all these TV Shows and placed them in chronological order.

There was also Reign, Marco Polo, Versailles, Black Sails, Roma, Medici (the one with Rob Stark), Roman Empire, Rises of Empires: Ottoman, Barbarians, Da Vinci’s Demons; among others

A note here is that I used to put some “not so faithful shows” since my objective is to make my students get interested on the History classes and have the wish to deep on their favorite period

You guys can see, I haven’t put some actual historical series since I haven’t deepened enough on this period on my classes, but if anyone would like to place here some good series (if possible with the historical period that it covers) will be a good addition

Actually I came here to ask if some of you guys have some séries to recommend, I’ll take a look and see if it’s relevant to this ultimate guide of Historical movies and TV shows. If possible, please insert the show name and the period that it covers

I’ll be updating this post depending of how the community receives it

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a master list of historically accurate movies and TV shows that are relevant to the time period being studied in history classes. This list could be updated as more relevant shows are created.
-Make a pamphlet or poster that can be hung in schools or public places that lists all of the historically accurate movies and TV shows that are relevant to the time period being studied in history classes, with a brief synopsis of each.
-Host a movie/TV show night for the community that would screen several of the historically accurate movies and TV shows that are relevant to the time period being studied in history classes.
