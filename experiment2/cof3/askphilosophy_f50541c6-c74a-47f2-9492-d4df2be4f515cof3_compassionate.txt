Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Is inverted or shifted qualia possible?
Basically my question is this - do we see colors the same way (and for that matter do we feel emotions, pain, temperature, hear sounds the same way etc)?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Make it clear that you are asking out of genuine curiosity, and not from a place of judgment.
-Encourage everyone to share their own experiences and perspectives.
-Ask questions to better understand everyone's individual viewpoints.
-Provide space for everyone to ask questions and share thoughts.
-Thank everyone for participating and for sharing their insights.
