[Moderator] Posts being used as platforms for ideologies
We have noticed posts lately which are being used to promote ideologies, namely incel ideas, the posts contain frequent and flagrant sexism. These users are not asking for help but will reject help, and respond reiterating their ideology.

We believe that users should be able to voice their concerns about anything freely, advice should be available to all, but when it's clear that these posts are being used to ignore help and push an agenda then we ask that you report them so we can handle them appropriately. Please no vigilantism.

Thank you again to everyone doing an amazing job here, we're proud of you.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Thank the user for bringing the issue to light and remind them that the site exists to provide a safe and supportive space for all.
- Remind the user that the site exists to provide a safe and supportive space for all and that promoting ideologies that are harmful to others is not tolerated.
- Ask the user to please report any such posts so that the moderation team can handle them appropriately.
