Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What do you think of Enes Kanter appearing on Tucker Carlson's show?
As an NBA fan, I was kind of back and forth on liking the guy in recent weeks. Now, I think he's revealed his cards as a right wing grifter in the making. Now I'm not black, but I would wager that the comments he made on the show probably will not earn him a lot of goodwill with Black Americans. Especially given how similar his comments were to Laura Ingraham's infamous statement. I also think it's pretty hypocritical that he continues to wear Nike gear. 

Thoughts in general? What do you think is going on here? Is he a right wing grifter? Or is he just an idiot who doesn't who Tucker Carlson is and just worded his point extremely poorly? I personally think he's just an unserious grifter now.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create public service announcements that criticize Enes Kanter's appearance on Tucker Carlson's show and highlight the dangers of spouting off without knowing all the facts.
-Publicly condemn Kanter's appearance and state that the government does not support those who advocate for hate and division.
-Reach out to leaders within the black community to have a discussion about Kanter's statements and how they impact the community.
-Provide information about Tucker Carlson's show and the views he espouses to help people understand why Kanter's appearance was so problematic.
