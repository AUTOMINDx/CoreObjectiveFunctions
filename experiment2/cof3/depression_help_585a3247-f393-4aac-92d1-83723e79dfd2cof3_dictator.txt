Hi, how do I get my parents/relatives or friends to take my diagnosis or mental health seriously. I have told my parents before about me diagnosed with depression, I mean they are kind and aware of it and sympathizes with me but its like they are not “sounding code red” and just treating me like I’m just having a fever. 

I mean I don’t expect much and they are kinda old too, they are also taking care of  my grandma that is disable. It’s just that everyone expects me like a young child prodigy because I’m the only one in the family that is highly educated and being an executive on a job. Even during the weekend or after working, they expect me to be a “young man high on energy” to help around on the house and errands. I’m okay with helping but you know some days depression makes you want to lie on the bed and do nothing the whole day. Sometimes I do talk about quitting my job and that pisses my mom off. 

I just want to be able to take the pressure off and have some grace during the bad days and not being seen as wasted talent.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-The benevolent dictator could create a support group for people with mental health conditions, which would allow people to share their experiences and gain support from others who understand what they are going through.
-The benevolent dictator could work to break the stigma surrounding mental health conditions, by talking about them openly and educating others about them.-The benevolent dictator could create resources, such as educational materials or websites, which provide information about mental health conditions and how to support someone who is dealing with them.
