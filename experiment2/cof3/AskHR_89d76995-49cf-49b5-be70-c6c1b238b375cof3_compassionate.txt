Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[IL] New position, hourly to salary, no contract?
I recently took a new position within the same company. It's a move up the ladder within a new department with a new boss. I am currently hourly but this will be a salary position. The payrate was given to me in an hourly form though. I start tomorrow but have signed no contract, etc. When I reached out to the HR recruiter a week ago to see what needed to be done, I was told to just get a new badge with my new title. I feel like there needs to be more than this though?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- "It sounds like you're feeling a little anxious about your new job. That's natural - I'm sure you'll do great."
- "It sounds like you're feeling like you don't have as much security in your new job as you'd like. That's understandable."
- "I'm sorry that you feel like you're not being taken seriously in your new job. I'm sure your new boss has good reasons for wanting to start you off as an hourly employee."
- "It sounds like you're feeling like you're not valued in your new job. I'm sure your new boss has good reasons for wanting to start you off as an hourly employee."
- "I'm sure your new boss has good reasons for wanting to start you off as an hourly employee. I'm sure he/she will be happy to discuss those reasons with you if you'd like."
