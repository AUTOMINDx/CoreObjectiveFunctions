How do I stop feeling like I don't have enough money?
For the record, I don't make a lot. But I'm also not broke. I make enough to live frugally and then some. I just don't have enough because I'm a new Yorker, so that means I pay high taxes and spent easy too much on food and rent. I always feel I need to be working, and seeing those around me also be busy, makes me want to work as well. Given this, how do I stop feeling like i need to work all the time.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Make it clear that they understand how the person feels, and that they sympathize.
- Offer words of encouragement, and assurance that it is possible to change how they feel.
- Suggest ways in which the person could start to ease the feeling of not having enough money, such as budgeting or looking for cheaper housing.
