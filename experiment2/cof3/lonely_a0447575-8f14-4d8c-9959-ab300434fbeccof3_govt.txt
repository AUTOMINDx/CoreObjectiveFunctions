Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Most of the time I'm glad that I don't have to worry about checking my phone/replying to people. But sometimes... I miss having that someone to chat nonsense with.
From the little daily nonsense stuff to the big philosophical things. Having someone to chat with, but on a deeper connection than just a friend, is something I miss so much. 

I guess I'll just go back to listening to podcasts to pretend I'm part of something.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Make a public service announcement about the health benefits of socializing and having deeper conversations with others
-Start a program that encourages people to meet up in groups and talk about deeper topics
-Facilitate online forums where people can discuss philosophical topics
