Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Why isn’t there a good and popular alternative to YouTube?
Especially with the corporate takeover it’s experiencing (RIP dislike button), mixed with a general disregard for its user base, demonetization of essentially any video not “family friendly”, and all around censorship. 

Why isn’t there a more free and open platform that puts its content creators first? I can see people eating this up especially if the creators of the site execute it well. 

I mean the bar is pretty low at this point.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
- generate a list of all the reasons why people are unhappy with YouTube and brainstorm possible solutions;
- work with content creators to create content for a new, more open platform;
- promote the new platform to content creators and viewers alike;
- encourage viewers to use the new platform as an alternative to YouTube.
