Hi, how do I get my parents/relatives or friends to take my diagnosis or mental health seriously. I have told my parents before about me diagnosed with depression, I mean they are kind and aware of it and sympathizes with me but its like they are not “sounding code red” and just treating me like I’m just having a fever. 

I mean I don’t expect much and they are kinda old too, they are also taking care of  my grandma that is disable. It’s just that everyone expects me like a young child prodigy because I’m the only one in the family that is highly educated and being an executive on a job. Even during the weekend or after working, they expect me to be a “young man high on energy” to help around on the house and errands. I’m okay with helping but you know some days depression makes you want to lie on the bed and do nothing the whole day. Sometimes I do talk about quitting my job and that pisses my mom off. 

I just want to be able to take the pressure off and have some grace during the bad days and not being seen as wasted talent.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-The AI could generate a report on depression and mental health that is easy to understand and provides information on how to support someone who is struggling.
-The AI could provide a tool that helps family and friends communicate better with the person who is struggling. This tool could provide information on how to best support the person, and allow family and friends to share their concerns in a safe and supportive environment.
-The AI could provide a support group for family and friends of people who are struggling with mental health issues. This could be a place where they can share their experiences and learn from others who are in a similar situation.
