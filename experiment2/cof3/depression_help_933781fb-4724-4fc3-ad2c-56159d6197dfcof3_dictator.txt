Mom has BPD and PTSD - How do I help?
21F

My mother is incredibly smart. For her own privacy I will not share all of her accomplishments. But she holds the highest engineering degree possible in the US and she came from nothing. She grew up with one abusive parent and was homeless in a famously dangerous city as a teenager. She is the reason I set standards for myself so high. She is the reason I set my goals unreasonably high. She has overcome so much in life and she is so incredibly successful now.

She had a bad job experience that resulted in a loss of a friendship. She went on medications and  didn't like the way they altered her thoughts, so she immediately stopped taking them. Now she suffers from episodes of sadness and uncertainty. My parents have never had marriage issues, but I can tell my dad doesn't know how to handle the changes. They've spent tens of thousands of dollars on therapists and traveled around the country for help. I just want to be able to be there for my mom like she was there for me as child, but its getting really hard. She tends to have bad and good months or even years. She is easily triggered by things from her past or even just odd noises or movements.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Suggest that the family tries a therapy approach that focuses on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). This type of therapy has been found to be helpful for individuals with BPD.
- Suggest that the family looks into a support group specifically for loved ones of individuals with BPD. There are often groups available in-person and online.
- Encourage the family to keep a journal in which they document progress, triggers, and helpful strategies. This can be a helpful tool for all involved.
