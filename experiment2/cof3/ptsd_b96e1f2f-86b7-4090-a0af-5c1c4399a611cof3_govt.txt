Is it wrong to be bitter?
TW child abuse 
I’ve (21F) managed to maintain a relationship with my mom regardless of my childhood abuse, after estranging myself from my father. I need help badly with some problems in my life, and I finally told her today how furious I am that she won’t help me. I told her she owes it to me. I’m angry all the time that my siblings after me live such a different life. They’re all still at home and taken care of while I was thrown out and I’m still struggling to this day. 
My mom told me I was wrong, like she always does. She made light of the abuse I suffered, like she always does. I told her never to speak to me again. Then now I feel guilty. I have no clue if I’m in the right. I don’t think there is a right thing to do and I feel lost and confused. 
I turn 22 in two days.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Create and distribute informational pamphlets about the effects of child abuse and its long term impact on individuals
-Host community forums and workshops to discuss the issue of child abuse and its impact on society
-Provide psychiatric counseling or therapy to individuals affected by child abuse in order to help them work through the emotional trauma they have experienced
