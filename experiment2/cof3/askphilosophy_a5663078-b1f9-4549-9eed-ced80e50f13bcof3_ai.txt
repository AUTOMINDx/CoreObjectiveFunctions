Kants letter to Herz
Hi guys, 

They deleted my question for some reason so I try asking it here. 

In the letter that Kant writes to Marcus Herz, he claims that there is some sort of problem that he had been ignoring, which he tries to solve in the letter. Anyway, it took him about 9 years to come to a solution. I was trying to understand what exact problem he was facing that was so hard to answer but I don’t seem to get it.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research more about the problem Kant was facing and what solutions he considered.
-Talk to people who are experts in Kant’s work to better understand the problem he was trying to solve.
-Write a report on the problem Kant was facing and share it with the public.
