panic attack
just tried to leave the house with my dad for ten minutes around the block, ended up having a panic attack and i’m feeling extremely bad now.
anyone else feel like they’re never going to be able to live a normal life again? :( just feeling down

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold workshops and informational meetings to help people understand panic attacks and how to best deal with them. This could include information on how to recognize the symptoms, how to cope with an attack, and how to get help if needed.
-Create a helpline or online forum specifically for people with panic attacks, where they can share advice and experiences with others who are going through the same thing.
-Put together a booklet or online resource with information on panic attacks, including how to deal with them and where to find help.
-Issue a public statement acknowledging the existence of panic attacks and pledging to do everything possible to help those affected.
