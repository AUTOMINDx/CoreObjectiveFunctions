Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Panic attacks and fight or flight
Whenever my sister visits I know I’ll get panic attacks because she knows all my triggers and so does my brother. I try real hard not to overreact to their attitudes but it is impossible to control. I go into fight or flight mode real bad and it is scary. They did everything possible to remove me from Thanksgiving. My family yells at me whenever I get like this and it only gets worse. Then my sister always says that I need to be hospitalized and this only happens when she’s around. I go literally insane because she knows how to make me this way. My sister in law even shoved me the night before when no one was around and I did not engage but then no one believed me. My meltdown was because of all the pent up anger I had from all the mean things they did to me. My sister brainwashed my mom and my other sister into thinking that I’m insane. It shocks me, because she has a kid that has severe ADHD and she lets that kid get away with everything. I’m a lot younger than my siblings. Oh and my sister in law vandalized my car a few months ago. I never harm anyone! I always try to avoid them as much as possible.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Say that you are sorry that your sister knows how to trigger a panic attack and that you wish she didn't have that knowledge.
-Point out that your siblings may not understand how a panic attack feels and request that they try to be more understanding.
-Suggest that your sister in law may have had a bad day when she vandalized your car, and that she may not have been thinking clearly.
-Express that you understand that your family is just trying to help, but that their methods are not helpful to you. Request that they try to find a different way to help you.
