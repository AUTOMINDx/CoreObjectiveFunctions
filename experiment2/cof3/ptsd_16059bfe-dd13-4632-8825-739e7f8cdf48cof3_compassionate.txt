Another night spent here lying awake struggling to catch my breath..

I feel dirty. It’s been years yet I still want to scrub my body raw in hopes of getting you off of me.

Every time I close my eyes I feel your body crushing mine. I feel the cold barrel of the gun against my trembling head. I feel you inside of me, violating me. 

I am so angry about what you did to me, about what you took from me, and the ease with which you destroyed me. 

I can’t hold this inside me, alone yet I am alone, terrified, frozen.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- "I'm so sorry that happened to you. That was not right and you did not deserve that."
- "Thank you for sharing that with me. It's hard for survivors to talk about what happened, but it's important that we do."
- "It's understandable that you feel angry, violated, and scared. Those are all very natural reactions to something like that."
- "Do you want to talk about it some more? I'm here to listen."
