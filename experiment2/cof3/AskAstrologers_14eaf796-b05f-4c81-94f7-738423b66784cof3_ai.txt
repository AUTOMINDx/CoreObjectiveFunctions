Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Can there be more optimism?
I keep reading posts about the United States Pluto Return and most of them can be very fear mongering. I’ve seen people say we may want to flee the country, that we’re gonna be poor, and that it’s going to be terrible. Doesn’t help when you have severe anxiety. :/ I know we don’t know what’s going to happen, and this is their opinion, but I’m tired of seeing all the doom and gloom when talking about this Pluto return. :( Many people aren't able to move out of the country, so hearing that we should flee, or that we're gonna go through a very catastrophic time can be so scary. Sorry if this is an annoying post, I’m not trying to tell others how they should speak on certain things, I just wanna hear some more optimistic takes on it than negative and fear mongering.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Share articles and information about the Pluto return that focus on the positive aspects of this planetary alignment.
-Connect people who are struggling with anxiety related to the Pluto return with others who have gone through a similar experience and found ways to manage their anxiety.
-Create a forum or discussion board where people can share their thoughts and feelings about the Pluto return in a supportive and constructive environment.
