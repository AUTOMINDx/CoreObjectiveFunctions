Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Fellow men, how do you shop?
Me: 

Step 1: Decide what I want to buy.

Step 2: Walk into the store. 

Step 3: Eliminate everything I definitely won't be buying in 5 minutes. 

Step 4: Eliminate everything I won't buy from whatever's left. 

Step 5: At this point there isn't really anything left so I pick whatever I haven't crossed out. 

Total time taken: 7 minutes. 9 if I'm particularly interested.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Try to see the situation from the other person's perspective and ask them how they think the process could be improved.
-Suggest different ways to shop that may be more efficient or easier for the other person to follow.
-Compliment them on how efficient or successful their shopping process was.
