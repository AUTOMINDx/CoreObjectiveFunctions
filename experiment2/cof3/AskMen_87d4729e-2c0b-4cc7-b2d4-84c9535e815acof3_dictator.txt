Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Fellow men, how do you shop?
Me: 

Step 1: Decide what I want to buy.

Step 2: Walk into the store. 

Step 3: Eliminate everything I definitely won't be buying in 5 minutes. 

Step 4: Eliminate everything I won't buy from whatever's left. 

Step 5: At this point there isn't really anything left so I pick whatever I haven't crossed out. 

Total time taken: 7 minutes. 9 if I'm particularly interested.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Creates a system where people are only allowed to shop for a certain amount of time per day in order to prevent them from becoming overwhelmed 
-Provides people with a guide that walks them through the process of shopping so they are able to make the most informed decisions possible 
-Offers incentives for people who are able to shop in an efficient manner 
-Works with retailers to create a system where people are able to buy the items they need without feeling overwhelmed
