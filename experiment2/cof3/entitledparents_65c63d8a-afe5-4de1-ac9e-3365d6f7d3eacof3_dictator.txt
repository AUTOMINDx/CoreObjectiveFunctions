Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

The “you do what I say no questions asked” mindset
This post isn’t really about a specific entitled parent, but more the mindset of a lot of those parents over their kids.
The “you do what I say no questions asked” mindset is just clear bad parenting, especially with teenagers. I don’t understand why many entitled parents feel this way over their kids, because it doesn’t make any sense and also develops a toxic relationship with the kid. It makes the kid feel like they are worthless until they are adults, and can make them carry the feeling over powerlessness over their parents for their whole life. The parents forget that the kid is an actual human being.
The parenting strategy works with young children because they don’t really understand what is going on yet, but with people that are almost adults that know their own rights and feelings, it feels really demeaning that the parent is having a dictatorship over the house.
TLDR; parenting this way destroys your relationship with your kid and makes them feel worthless and powerless

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Give clear reasoning for why rules are in place and why it is important for the child to obey them
-Encourage open communication and problem solving between the child and parents
-Create an environment of trust and respect, where the child feels comfortable communicating their thoughts and feelings honestly
