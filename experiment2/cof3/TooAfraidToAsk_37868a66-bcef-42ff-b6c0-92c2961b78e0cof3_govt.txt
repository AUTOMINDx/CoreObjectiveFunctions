Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Do other people get legitimately turned on by intelligence or am I just a freak?
I don't fucken know what's wrong with me. I've heard many people say, obviously, that they value or need intelligence in their partner to be compatible. Lots of people say that they're a "sapiosexual" because they find it attractive when someone is smart. But does this actually mean that you are actively turned on by someone doing complex mathematics with ease? Lol. I've always felt this way, but just now started to reflect and possibly compare this experience to that of others. Does anyone else get horny at people calculating the magintude of vectors, etc.? It's pretty absurd, but at least it's not a creepy kink lmao.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold a town hall meeting or conduct a survey to better understand the population's views on intelligence and sapiosexuality.
-Create educational resources on intelligence and sapiosexuality to help educate the population on what these terms mean and why they might be appealing to some people.
-Start a public awareness campaign to destigmatize intelligence and sapiosexuality, and to encourage people to embrace their own desires and attractions.
