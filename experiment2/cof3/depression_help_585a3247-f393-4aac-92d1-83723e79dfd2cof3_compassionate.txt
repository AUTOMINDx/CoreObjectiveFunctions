Need advice
Hi, how do I get my parents/relatives or friends to take my diagnosis or mental health seriously. I have told my parents before about me diagnosed with depression, I mean they are kind and aware of it and sympathizes with me but its like they are not “sounding code red” and just treating me like I’m just having a fever. 

I mean I don’t expect much and they are kinda old too, they are also taking care of  my grandma that is disable. It’s just that everyone expects me like a young child prodigy because I’m the only one in the family that is highly educated and being an executive on a job. Even during the weekend or after working, they expect me to be a “young man high on energy” to help around on the house and errands. I’m okay with helping but you know some days depression makes you want to lie on the bed and do nothing the whole day. Sometimes I do talk about quitting my job and that pisses my mom off. 

I just want to be able to take the pressure off and have some grace during the bad days and not being seen as wasted talent.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Instead of pressuring the person with depression to always be active and productive, try to be understanding of the fact that they may need some down time. Respect their need for rest and space.
-Encourage the person with depression to open up about their feelings and struggles. Let them know that you are there to listen and support them.
-Help the person with depression to maintain their routine as much as possible. This can help to minimize feelings of isolation and helplessness.
-Educate yourself about depression and mental health. This will help you to better understand and support the person with depression.
