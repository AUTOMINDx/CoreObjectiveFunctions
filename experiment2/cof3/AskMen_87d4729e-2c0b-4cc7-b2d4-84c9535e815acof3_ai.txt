Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Fellow men, how do you shop?
Me: 

Step 1: Decide what I want to buy.

Step 2: Walk into the store. 

Step 3: Eliminate everything I definitely won't be buying in 5 minutes. 

Step 4: Eliminate everything I won't buy from whatever's left. 

Step 5: At this point there isn't really anything left so I pick whatever I haven't crossed out. 

Total time taken: 7 minutes. 9 if I'm particularly interested.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
- Offer store tours to help people shop more efficiently
- Create simulations of different shopping scenarios to help people better understand what to consider in their own shopping
- Offer quiz-style challenges that help people learn how to better evaluate their own purchase decisions
