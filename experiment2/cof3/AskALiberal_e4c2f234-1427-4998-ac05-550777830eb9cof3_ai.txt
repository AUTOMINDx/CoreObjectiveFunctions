Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What do you think of Enes Kanter appearing on Tucker Carlson's show?
As an NBA fan, I was kind of back and forth on liking the guy in recent weeks. Now, I think he's revealed his cards as a right wing grifter in the making. Now I'm not black, but I would wager that the comments he made on the show probably will not earn him a lot of goodwill with Black Americans. Especially given how similar his comments were to Laura Ingraham's infamous statement. I also think it's pretty hypocritical that he continues to wear Nike gear. 

Thoughts in general? What do you think is going on here? Is he a right wing grifter? Or is he just an idiot who doesn't who Tucker Carlson is and just worded his point extremely poorly? I personally think he's just an unserious grifter now.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research white nationalist Fox News commentators to get a better understanding of their arguments and how they may be appealing to some viewers.
-Generate content that breaks down the argument made by Enes Kanter on Tucker Carlson's show, comparing it to the argument made by Laura Ingraham.
-Encourage people to watch the full interview with Enes Kanter on Tucker Carlson's show to get a better understanding of his argument.
