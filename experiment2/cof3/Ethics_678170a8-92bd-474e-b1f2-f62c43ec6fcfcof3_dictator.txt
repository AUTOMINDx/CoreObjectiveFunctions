Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Filling an ethically questionable job if I am committed to making it better than someone else would?
Hi everyone. Need advice.

I'm interviewing for a job that I find ethically questionable, to say the least. Think salesman for company that provides, among its products, very high interest rate loans for people with low credit.

However, I feel that I'm in a position to demand a veto against any egregious products. In other words, in my mind, taking this job would mean that fewer people would get sucked into harsh loan cycles than if I forego the job and let someone else take it who is less concerned with this ethical issue.

I think I know the answer here... Just help me understand why I shouldn't take the job.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold town hall meetings to discuss the ethical implications of accepting this job offer
-Publish articles in local newspapers/websites discussing why this job is unethical and why someone should not take it
-Create online forum where people can discuss the ethical implications of this job offer
-Provide information on local non-profit organizations that help people with low credit scores
