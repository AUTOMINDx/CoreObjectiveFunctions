Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone have hair loss or very fine hair? Afraid to date.
Unfortunately I have quite severe hair loss but I have curls so itâ€™s easy to hide it because I can just pull it up in a bun. 

I have never been in a relationship before but once I move out, I will try to put myself out and start dating. That being said, I wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar predicament?

Thanks!

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Host informational meetings or panels to discuss hair loss and its various causes
-Provide pamphlets or fact sheets about hair loss, its symptoms and treatments
-Create a social media campaign or website specifically devoted to hair loss education and support
-Partner with or fund hair loss support groups or charities
