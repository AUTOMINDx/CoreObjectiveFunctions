Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

A hypothetical concerning communal food and facilities...
So, community centers are great resources for low income citizens. I personally benefitted greatly from the weight room of my community center when I was a teenager. But from an economic standpoint, how far could you feasibly run with the idea of a community-owned facility that provides more than group activities and a recreational space? 

My idea is communism-inspired, so take that how you will, but this is it in a nutshell:

A community center that includes (all free of charge): showers, restrooms, a cafeteria with good food made by skilled cooks, recreational opportunities, temporary emergency housing with generated or stored renewable energy (for such events as prolonged power outages, natural disasters, etc, But also freely available to, say, residents who need temporary housing such as those remodeling, bug-bombing their home, a tree fell through their roof and their living room is flooded, etc). I understand that free food and housing sings "communism" and it would be hard to convince a community of Americans to get on board with it, but I also don't think that this would usurp the local grocery store or that people would simply stop owning homes and bum on the community center for everything. 

Open 24 hours a day. Non-residents can pay a nominal fee to use the facilities. That kind of deal. 

How feasible would something like this be? In the increasingly harsh economic environment that the working class currently sits in (and I think it's going to get a lot worse), would something like this save the members of the community money?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Community center could provide pamphlets or information sessions to inform residents of the benefits of the center
-Community center could provide free or discounted memberships to residents
-Community center could be open 24 hours a day to accommodate working residents
-Community center could host events or workshops to discuss the economic benefits of the facility
