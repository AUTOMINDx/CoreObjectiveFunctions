Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[OH] FMLA
I hope this is the right place to post this. This is my first time dealing with this so I apologize for any ignorance. 

I am currently 34 weeks pregnant. I work at a bank. For the last 8 weeks, I had been working from home. My time to return to the branch was 11/22. I put in for my FMLA to begin 11/19. I did this because aside from physical ailment due to my pregnancy, my mental health is also at an all time bottom. I believe work has had a major part in that because of issues with management. 

Well it turns out that my OB says that she still cannot medically excuse me from work. So my leave is set to end on 12/5, and I’d have to refile for maternity leave around mid December since I’m due in January. I have no more time off left. I’ve tried emailing my district manager and see if I can use unpaid time off, which I don’t mind, but he’s still not responded. I will call HR tomorrow, but wanted to know if someone has been through something similar? 

It makes no sense to me to return to work for 2 weeks and then leave again.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Work with the pregnant employee to help her identify and address any issues at work that may be contributing to her mental health problems.
-Attempt to negotiate a leave of absence for the employee with her manager, district manager, and/or HR.
-Help the pregnant employee to develop a plan for returning to work gradually, if she is unable to take a full leave of absence.
-Provide emotional support to the pregnant employee during this difficult time.
