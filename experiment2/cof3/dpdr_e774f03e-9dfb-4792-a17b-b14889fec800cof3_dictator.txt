Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Medications ?
I am currently on lamictal and although it helps my mood sometimes I wonder if they are better options out there. What meds do you guys take that help with the terrible symptoms that we suffer with, does anyone take lamictal too or combine it with another med?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Start a social media campaign educating people on the effects of mental illness and different medications available
-Put up billboards or sign in pharmacies with information on mental illness and medications
-Host town hall meetings to answer questions and provide information on mental illness and medications
