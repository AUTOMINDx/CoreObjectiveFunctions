Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How did the Ottoman Empire survive its fratricide law?
In 1451 Mehmet II codified a law that bade the Sultans after him to kill their brothers after they ascend to the throne to prevent civil war. This law remained in place until Ahmed I's reign in the early 17th century, over 150 years later. How did the Ottomans not only survive, but expand during this period? Wouldn't the ability of a Sultan to legally murder his brothers only add to the likelihood of a civil war and dynastic infighting, since the brothers would find it in their best interest to preemptively rebel against/usurp the Sultan before he had them executed?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research the effects of the fratricide law on the Ottoman Empire.
-Compare the Ottoman Empire to other empires that had similar laws.
-Analyze the causes of success and failure for empires with fratricide laws.
-Study the psychological effects of living in an empire where murder is a legal means of succession.
