Economists generally frown upon protectionism because of the inefficiencies and deadweight loss it creates. However, some industries are vital for national defense capability. They provide an intangible economic benefit to a nation that is not reflected in prices. In the event of a war, production capacity in these industries can be shifted for wartime production. Examples include:
