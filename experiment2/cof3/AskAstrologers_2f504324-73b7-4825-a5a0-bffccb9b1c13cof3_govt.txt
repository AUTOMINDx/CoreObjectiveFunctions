What advice would you give a younger person with your same sun and moon sign?
Greetings, astrologers.
Since weâ€™re in ask astrologers, I was wondering what advice you would give a younger person with your same sun/moon sign based on your own life experiences and astrological knowledge!

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold town halls or informational meetings to discuss astrology and answer questions from the public.
-Produce pamphlets, fact sheets, or other informational materials about astrology that can be distributed to the public.
-Create a website or online portal with information about astrology that is easy to navigate and user-friendly.
-Star in public service announcements or TV specials about astrology to help educate the public about this ancient practice.
