Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

People don’t feel real
I dead ass thinking I’m going insane, I think I’m borderline schizophrenic atp. The world doesn’t feel real, people don’t feel real. I can’t look at people’s faces for long without getting a sense of fear. Like, it’s almost like I’m scared of people. Granted, I know that they are real and I know I’m just f*cked in the head and I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but I do. It’s like the episode of spongebob where they all go on dry land, everything feels so off than it used to. I’m so afraid of developing schizophrenia, I’m literally mimicking delusions in my head that I KNOW AREN’T TRUE. “Objects can move and they are out to get me.” and yesterday I thought I was hearing things. I’ve been having bad dpdr for the past few days &amp; the fact that I’m low key scared of people makes me think I’m having persecutory delusions. People just look… weird to me. I can’t look at them without needing to look away because of how fake they look. I keep stressing out because I can’t snap out of it, and it’s making fear myself so badly. My thoughts feel off and I truly think I’m close to being psychotic.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-The AI could provide resources and information on schizophrenia, psychosis, and other mental health conditions. It could also provide information on how to seek help if needed.
-The AI could analyze the individual’s symptoms and generate a diagnosis if applicable.
-The AI could create a support group for people who are experiencing similar feelings. This could help to connect people who may be feeling isolated and increase understanding for one another.
