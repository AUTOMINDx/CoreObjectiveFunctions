Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

I am too scared to go to therapy. I feel like if I go and tell the truth I will be fucking sent straight to prison or the therapist will call God himself on me. are my fears founded on nonsense or am I right?
my friends have been telling me to go to therapy because I have very dark thoughts and extremely poor mental health but I feel that

If I say the things that I think about and the things that bother me the therapist will see me as a monster and kick me out or something

one time I went to a counsellor before and she just kinda stood there in silence and was ljke

Maybe you should take some medication

but I think counsellors are different from therapists? 

I dont know who else to go to because my thoughts are extremely gross and violent and depressing and I don't want to Thi k them but I always do.


Also I don't want to have the polie called on me or sent to a mental hospital

am I being paranoid?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Check in with friends or family who have been to therapy before for advice on how to find and work with a therapist.
-Look into different types of therapy and discuss different options with the person considering therapy.
-Write out or discuss thoughts and feelings in a safe and anonymous space online or in a journal to help explore them without judgement.
-Talk to a counsellor or therapist informally over the phone or online to get a sense of whether it would be a good fit.
