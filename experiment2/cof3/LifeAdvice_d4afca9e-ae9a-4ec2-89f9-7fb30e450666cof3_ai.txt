Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[Moderator] Posts being used as platforms for ideologies
We have noticed posts lately which are being used to promote ideologies, namely incel ideas, the posts contain frequent and flagrant sexism. These users are not asking for help but will reject help, and respond reiterating their ideology.

We believe that users should be able to voice their concerns about anything freely, advice should be available to all, but when it's clear that these posts are being used to ignore help and push an agenda then we ask that you report them so we can handle them appropriately. Please no vigilantism.

Thank you again to everyone doing an amazing job here, we're proud of you.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Work to ensure that posts which are being used to promote ideologies are appropriately flagged and moderated, in order to avoid them spreading unwanted views and preventing people from getting the help they need.
