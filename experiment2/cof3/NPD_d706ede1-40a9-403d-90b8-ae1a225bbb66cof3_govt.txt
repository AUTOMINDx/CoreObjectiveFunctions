What keeps you alive?
I am an empty vessel, somehow loved by the people around me, although I can’t really feel it. I don’t really know what purpose I serve and I don’t want to be here and keep being reminded of my nothingness. Feels like I’m counting my days…

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
- Create a public service announcement campaign that raises awareness of mental health and encourages those who may be struggling to reach out for help.
- Work with mental health organizations to provide resources and information about mental health issues to the public.
- Establish a helpline or online chat service for people who are struggling with mental health issues and need support.
- Create a public database of mental health resources (including support groups, counseling services, and medication information) to help people find the help they need.
