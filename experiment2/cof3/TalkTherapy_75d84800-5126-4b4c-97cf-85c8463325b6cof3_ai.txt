Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Questions about Residential Treatment Centers
Hi all ðŸ˜Š I have complex PTSD and although Iâ€™m faaaairly stable at the moment, Iâ€™m still struggling a lot with flashbacks, insomnia and other issues. I talked to my therapist about the idea of going to an intensive outpatient program, but it turns out that apparently Iâ€™d have to take time off of work either way? 

So I guess, if any of you have experience with an IOP, or a residential treatment program, Iâ€™d like to know about it. 

Itâ€™s okay to DM me if youâ€™d prefer, canâ€™t promise Iâ€™ll get around to replying but Iâ€™ll definitely read them all. Thanks in advance.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a survey to better understand the experiences of people who have been to residential treatment centers.
-Hold a forum or talk show to give people the opportunity to share their experiences and ask questions.
-Collaborate with therapy organizations to develop more effective ways to treat trauma.
