Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How do you back out of plans you agreed to doing?
Some of my friends and I had planned to go to a holiday event on Saturday. Even though we had made these plans weeks ago I am just not feeling up to going anymore. The event is over an hour away from my home and it doesn't seem like something I want to do now. I would rather do something else instead, like just go out to dinner. One of my other friends feels the same way and she is hoping someone else will cancel. But I feel like just being direct and telling our friends now- rather than wait until the last minute- that I no longer can make it. At the same time I don't want to come across as a flake. Any advice on what a good reason would be not to go?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Give advice on effective communication, specifically how to decline an invitation in a way that is respectful to both the invitee and the event organizer.
-Suggest that the AI's friends send a group text to the event organizer explaining why they will not be able to attend.
-Offer to help the AI's friends write a polite and respectful explanation for why they will not be able to attend the event.
