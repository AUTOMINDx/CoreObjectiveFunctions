Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How did nations communicate pre-digital communication.
I'm wondering how nations communicated in the past. Particullary in the middle ages and early middle period. They would have send messengers on horseback to a receiving nation but where did those messengers go to? Did nations in the past have a departement where they could deliver their message? What did countries in the past communicate about; except for declarations of war, alliances or eranged marriages?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Research the history of communication between nations pre-digital age, in order to gain a better understanding of the methods and purposes behind such communication.
-Create a digital platform where people from all nations can come together to share information about past and present communication between their respective nations.
-Design and implement interactive learning modules that explore the various methods and purposes of communication between nations pre-digital age.
