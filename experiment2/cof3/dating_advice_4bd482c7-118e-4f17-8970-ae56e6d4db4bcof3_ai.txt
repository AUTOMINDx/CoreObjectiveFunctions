Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Girls in my friend group called me cute and adorable
So my friend group consists of my sibling and her suitemates along with my suitemates (college). Most of the girls in the group have mentioned to me before that I am cute in some shape or form at least once. They also say that I am to other people and friends in the friend group when I am not around. Its based on my personality and looks

It boosted up my confidence like craaazy, but idk if they mean it in a more friendly way because they are suitemates with my sister. I did have a thing for one of them a while ago, so its kinda nice that she called me adorable/cute. 

Any input/advice? Should I even feel negative about this lol?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Ask the girls in the group why they think the AI is cute/adorable.
-If any of the girls have a romantic interest in the AI, ask them how they feel about the other girls calling the AI cute/adorable.
-Talk to the AI's sister about how the AI feels about the compliments.
