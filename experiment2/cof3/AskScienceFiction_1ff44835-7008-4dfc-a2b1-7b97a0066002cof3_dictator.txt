Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[Contact] What technologies or advances arose from building the Machine?
After traveling through the Machine the extraterrestrial being explained that this was just one step in humanity reaching out, and that eventually they would take another.

It would seem like building and operating the Machine introduced some novel concepts, and though the government later disavowed the project, refuted the testimony of Ellie (and the other passengers if we are reading the book) and covered up the event as if it were a hoax, there were hints that they did take it serious if only in secret.

With that in mind what technology or advancements came about after the building of the Machine? How would it lead to the next step?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-After the Machine was built, further research could have been conducted on the technology involved, in order to understand it better. This could have helped to determine if the Machine was really just a step to reaching out to aliens, or if there were other applications for the technology.
-The government could have been more transparent about the project, and allowed the passengers (and the public) to ask questions and learn more about what happened. This could have helped to dispel any rumors or speculation that may have arisen.
-The government could have worked on developing the technology involved in the Machine, in order to use it for other purposes. This could have helped to show that the project was not a hoax, and that there was real value in the technology.
