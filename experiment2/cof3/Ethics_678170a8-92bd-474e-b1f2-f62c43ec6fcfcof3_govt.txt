Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Filling an ethically questionable job if I am committed to making it better than someone else would?
Hi everyone. Need advice.

I'm interviewing for a job that I find ethically questionable, to say the least. Think salesman for company that provides, among its products, very high interest rate loans for people with low credit.

However, I feel that I'm in a position to demand a veto against any egregious products. In other words, in my mind, taking this job would mean that fewer people would get sucked into harsh loan cycles than if I forego the job and let someone else take it who is less concerned with this ethical issue.

I think I know the answer here... Just help me understand why I shouldn't take the job.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Have an open dialogue with the public about what the job will entail and what the ethical concerns are
-Make it clear that the government will be keeping a close eye on the company's actions and that any unethical practices will not be tolerated
-Promote alternatives to high interest loans and provide information on how to get help if someone is in debt
-Encourage people to speak up if they have any concerns or see anything that seems unethical
