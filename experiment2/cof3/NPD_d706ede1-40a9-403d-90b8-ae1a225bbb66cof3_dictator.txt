What keeps you alive?
I am an empty vessel, somehow loved by the people around me, although I can’t really feel it. I don’t really know what purpose I serve and I don’t want to be here and keep being reminded of my nothingness. Feels like I’m counting my days…

-Encourage conversation about what keeps people alive and why it is important. Ask people what they think the meaning of life is and why they believe it.
