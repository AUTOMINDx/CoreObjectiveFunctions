Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Panic attacks and fight or flight
Whenever my sister visits I know I’ll get panic attacks because she knows all my triggers and so does my brother. I try real hard not to overreact to their attitudes but it is impossible to control. I go into fight or flight mode real bad and it is scary. They did everything possible to remove me from Thanksgiving. My family yells at me whenever I get like this and it only gets worse. Then my sister always says that I need to be hospitalized and this only happens when she’s around. I go literally insane because she knows how to make me this way. My sister in law even shoved me the night before when no one was around and I did not engage but then no one believed me. My meltdown was because of all the pent up anger I had from all the mean things they did to me. My sister brainwashed my mom and my other sister into thinking that I’m insane. It shocks me, because she has a kid that has severe ADHD and she lets that kid get away with everything. I’m a lot younger than my siblings. Oh and my sister in law vandalized my car a few months ago. I never harm anyone! I always try to avoid them as much as possible.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold family therapy sessions in which all parties can express their concerns and frustrations in a safe and constructive setting.
-If sister visiting triggers panic attacks, work with the individual to establish a safety plan and coping mechanisms to help them better manage the situation.
-Provide education to family members about panic attacks and how to best support someone who is experiencing them.
-If sister in law has vandalized the person's car, work with her to establish restitution and repair the damage.
-Create a support system for the individual, such as a therapist or counsellor, who can help them to manage their anxiety and stress.
