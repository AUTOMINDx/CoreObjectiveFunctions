Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Most of the time I'm glad that I don't have to worry about checking my phone/replying to people. But sometimes... I miss having that someone to chat nonsense with.
From the little daily nonsense stuff to the big philosophical things. Having someone to chat with, but on a deeper connection than just a friend, is something I miss so much. 

I guess I'll just go back to listening to podcasts to pretend I'm part of something.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Provide outlets for people to communicate and connect with each other on a deeper level, either through physical spaces or online platforms
-Encourage people to communicate their thoughts and feelings openly and honestly, in a supportive and judgment-free environment
-Promote mindfulness and self-reflection as means of cultivating empathy and understanding for others
