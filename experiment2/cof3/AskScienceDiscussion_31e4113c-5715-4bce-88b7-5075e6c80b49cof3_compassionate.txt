Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Is proton decay more or less accepted or decidedly not going to happen?
I've seen videos about iron stars that suggest proton decay will not occur, but at the same time I believed it was only natural for all things to "decay" as entropy increases.  What is the currect mindset held by the scientific community... will we get mass stockpiles of unfusable iron or a world without stars?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Ask people what they believe about proton decay and why they believe what they do.
-Share information about proton decay and what the scientific community believes about it.
-Encourage open discussion and questioning of beliefs about proton decay.
