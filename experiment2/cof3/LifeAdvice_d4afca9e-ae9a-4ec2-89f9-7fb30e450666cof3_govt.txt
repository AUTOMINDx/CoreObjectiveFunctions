Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

[Moderator] Posts being used as platforms for ideologies
We have noticed posts lately which are being used to promote ideologies, namely incel ideas, the posts contain frequent and flagrant sexism. These users are not asking for help but will reject help, and respond reiterating their ideology.

We believe that users should be able to voice their concerns about anything freely, advice should be available to all, but when it's clear that these posts are being used to ignore help and push an agenda then we ask that you report them so we can handle them appropriately. Please no vigilantism.

Thank you again to everyone doing an amazing job here, we're proud of you.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-commonly accepted definitions of words and terms, with usage examples, could be provided in an easily accessible FAQ or glossary on the government website;
-government could provide an easily accessible platform for people to share their stories and experiences, including those who have been hurt by ideologies such as incels, in a safe and supportive environment;
-government could provide information and resources on how to recognize warning signs that someone may be vulnerable to being influenced by dangerous ideologies, and how to get help if needed.
