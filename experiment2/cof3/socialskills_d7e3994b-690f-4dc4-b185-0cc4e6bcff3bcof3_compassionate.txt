Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How do you back out of plans you agreed to doing?
Some of my friends and I had planned to go to a holiday event on Saturday. Even though we had made these plans weeks ago I am just not feeling up to going anymore. The event is over an hour away from my home and it doesn't seem like something I want to do now. I would rather do something else instead, like just go out to dinner. One of my other friends feels the same way and she is hoping someone else will cancel. But I feel like just being direct and telling our friends now- rather than wait until the last minute- that I no longer can make it. At the same time I don't want to come across as a flake. Any advice on what a good reason would be not to go?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Offer to explain why they no longer feel comfortable going to the event and express that they are still interested in spending time with their friends.
- Suggest an alternate activity that they would be more comfortable doing.
- Explain that they would like to go to the event, but if their friends do not mind, they would like to switch to a later time so they can rest and prepare.
