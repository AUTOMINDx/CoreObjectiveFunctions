Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Please help… my son (4) has elevated (and flagged) potassium and creatinine levels.. what could this mean?!
Male , 4 years old, 53 pounds, 3’7 
No medications or health issues. 

My 4 year old was experiencing some bladder issues, accidents constantly and not realizing he was having them. So I took him in after a few weeks of this thinking it was a UTI or something of the sort. 

After urine came back “perfect” his dr did some blood tests. His creatinine and potassium came back super elevated. Dr was concerned but wanted to do blood again a few weeks later and while he was fasting. So here we are again.. higher creatinine and potassium. We have a referral to a nephrologist 

My questions concerns are.. what do we expect from this. Dr google doesn’t help the anxiety at all!! 

His current levels were: Creatinine (range is .20-.50) his level was .71

Potassium (range 3.5 - 4.7) his level was 6.6 

His first lab results, his BUN  was lower than range but now it is just barely in range.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Express empathy for what the person is going through.
- Offer to help researched medical information on the situation.
- Seek support from friends or family to provide comfort and support.
