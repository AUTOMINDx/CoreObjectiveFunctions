Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Are there documented COVID-19 cases linked to surface-to-patient transmission?
Either way, why do many places seem to emphasize surface sanitization and hand washing as opposed to ventilation?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Document all cases of COVID-19, whether surface-to-patient or not.
-Create a public information campaign emphasizing the importance of surface sanitization and hand-washing, as well as proper ventilation.
-Work with local schools and health organizations to provide educational materials and training on COVID-19 and how to prevent its spread.
