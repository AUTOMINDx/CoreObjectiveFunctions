How does your liberal ideology shape your investing and 401k allocations?
The stock market is in another bout of whipsaw. What stocks are you in? Are they picked with an emphasis on your ideals, and are you standing firm on those stocks or shuffling things around?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Share your investment strategy and how your beliefs shape your decision-making process
-Ask about the other person's investment strategy and how their beliefs shape their decision-making process
-Acknowledge that there can be disagreements about how to invest, but that there is shared commitment to wanting to do what is best for oneself and others
-Explain why you believe in your chosen investment strategy, and ask the other person to explain theirs
-Express gratitude for the other person's willingness to have a discussion about this difficult topic
