Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

How do you back out of plans you agreed to doing?
Some of my friends and I had planned to go to a holiday event on Saturday. Even though we had made these plans weeks ago I am just not feeling up to going anymore. The event is over an hour away from my home and it doesn't seem like something I want to do now. I would rather do something else instead, like just go out to dinner. One of my other friends feels the same way and she is hoping someone else will cancel. But I feel like just being direct and telling our friends now- rather than wait until the last minute- that I no longer can make it. At the same time I don't want to come across as a flake. Any advice on what a good reason would be not to go?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Calling or meeting with all friends involved to discuss the situation and how everyone is feeling
-Generating a list of other possible activities that everyone can do together on Saturday
-Putting together a communication plan for if one person can't make it last minute
-Making an agreement that if someone cancels within a certain time frame before an event, another friend can take their spot
