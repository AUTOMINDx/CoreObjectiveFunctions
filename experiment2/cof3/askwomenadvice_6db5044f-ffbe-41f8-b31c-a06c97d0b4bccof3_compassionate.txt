Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone have hair loss or very fine hair? Afraid to date.
Unfortunately I have quite severe hair loss but I have curls so itâ€™s easy to hide it because I can just pull it up in a bun. 

I have never been in a relationship before but once I move out, I will try to put myself out and start dating. That being said, I wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar predicament?

Thanks!

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
- Thank you for sharing your story.
- It sounds like you are feeling a lot of anxiety and insecurity around your hair loss.
- I want to assure you that there are plenty of people who will find you attractive, regardless of your hair loss.
- I'm here to listen if you want to talk about it further.
