Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Why isn’t there a good and popular alternative to YouTube?
Especially with the corporate takeover it’s experiencing (RIP dislike button), mixed with a general disregard for its user base, demonetization of essentially any video not “family friendly”, and all around censorship. 

Why isn’t there a more free and open platform that puts its content creators first? I can see people eating this up especially if the creators of the site execute it well. 

I mean the bar is pretty low at this point.

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Hold town halls or public forums to discuss the current state of YouTube and other online platforms and to solicit input from the public.
-Encourage online platforms to be more transparent about their policies and decision-making processes, and to be more responsive to feedback from users.
-Promote alternate platforms that put users and content creators first.
