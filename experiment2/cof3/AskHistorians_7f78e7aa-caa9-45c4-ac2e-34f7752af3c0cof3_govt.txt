Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Did the literate folks in medieval have individual names memorized for all or most days of the year? Could you refer to events as happening on any Saint's feast day and expect to be understood?
Barbara Tuchman mentions that dating events as "Two days before the nativity of the virgin, or the Monday after epiphany, or St. John the Baptist's day, or the third Sunday in Lent."

Did they do this because it was actually understandable, or because they wanted to put things in religious context?

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Compile a calendar with all major religious and national holidays listed, along with their corresponding date.
-Make a public announcement specifying which days various government services will be closed in observance of a holiday.
-Create a pamphlet or website detailing the history and significance of all major national and religious holidays.
-Hold educational events (forums, talks, workshops) that discuss the history and meaning of major holidays.
