Persistent abdominal pain not going away
Hello! I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing is GERD or not but I could really use some advice on what I've been experiencing!

Recently I've been waking up in the middle of the night with extreme upper abdominal pain when I eat certain types of food, usually just overeating but there are trigger foods that I have yet to discover. The past few times of experiencing this pain I could take some pepto and be done with it in 10-20 minutes. I had a bad experience a few days ago that I think might have been related to a hiatal hernia (it runs in the family, I have yet to be diagnosed) and decided to start eating smaller portions more often in the day, and it really helped! Today for dinner I thought it would be fun to splurge and eat more than I had been, and voila, guess what came to visit me. The abdominal pain was what I would consider severe; shortness of breath, cold sweats, trembling and fatigue for 2 hours straight. I took some pepto early on when it first started and it didn't do a thing. I laid on my left side and just fought through the pain and I guess I fell asleep for a few minutes and woke up with it gone. I felt so relieved that I could finally feel normal again, and then the second round started, almost the same way as the first, Bloating and dull abdominal pain that got worse and worse. The pain isn't as extreme as the first round, but it's still nothing I would wish upon anyone. The only position that is somewhat relieving is curling over a pillow with my arms out, somewhat like the child's pose but cross legged. I've been having major nausea and have almost hurled a few times. I feel like throwing up would make me feel better, but I don't want to take any chances, especially since I'm extremely dehydrated. This has been happening for about 3 hours now and its still there. Its 4am and I just want to sleep :( any help would be much appreciated

Edit: It was food poisoning ðŸ˜¬

Ideas for competent government to increase understanding for all involved:
-Competent government could provide information on what GERD is, how it is treated, and the symptoms that are associated with it.
-Competent government could provide a forum for people to share their experiences with GERD, both good and bad, in order to increase understanding and empathy for those who suffer from it.
-Competent government could work with healthcare professionals to develop guidelines for how to best treat GERD and the symptoms that are associated with it.
