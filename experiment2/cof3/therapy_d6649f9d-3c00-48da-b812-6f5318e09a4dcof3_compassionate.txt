Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Starting therapy at an OCD treatment center and I'm extremely nervous.
I've been in therapy for years for ptsd, and BPD, but recently reached out to an OCD center since where I have been going doesn't have an OCD specialist. The treatment I've done has helped with my ptsd and bpd a lot but my OCD is now my primary concern. I'm worried treatment here could cause me to backslide or lead to something bad happening. If I hadn't made so much progress and wasn't so scared of how I was before my progress I don't think it would be a problem. Has anyone here had OCD specialized therapy? Is it intimidating?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Share information about OCD and its treatment to help increase understanding for the person with OCD.
-Ask the person how they are feeling and what their concerns are.
-Provide reassurance that the person will be treated with care and compassion.
-Listen to the person's concerns and feelings and provide support.
