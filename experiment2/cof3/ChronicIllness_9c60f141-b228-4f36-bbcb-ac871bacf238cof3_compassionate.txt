A conversation I had with the nurse at my gyno's office when I requested an appointment. I do not have an IUD...


Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Thank you for your time and for being willing to help me.
-It sounds like you have a lot of experience with this and I really appreciate your knowledge.
-Is there anything I can do to make the appointment more comfortable for you?
-I understand that this is not the experience you are used to, and I really appreciate your help.
