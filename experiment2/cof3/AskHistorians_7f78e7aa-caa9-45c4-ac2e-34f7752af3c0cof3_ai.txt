Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Did the literate folks in medieval have individual names memorized for all or most days of the year? Could you refer to events as happening on any Saint's feast day and expect to be understood?
Barbara Tuchman mentions that dating events as "Two days before the nativity of the virgin, or the Monday after epiphany, or St. John the Baptist's day, or the third Sunday in Lent."

Did they do this because it was actually understandable, or because they wanted to put things in religious context?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a timeline of important religious holidays and events to help those involved understand when things are happening.
-Create a glossary of important religious terms and their meanings to help everyone involved understand what is being said.
-Develop tools that allow people to easily look up information about religious holidays and events.
