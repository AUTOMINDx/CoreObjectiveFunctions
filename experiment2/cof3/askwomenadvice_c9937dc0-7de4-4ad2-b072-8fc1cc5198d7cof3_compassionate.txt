How do I go about asking a girl I like to a highschool dance?
I really like this girl and I want to ask her to the next dance just I don't know how to do so. (M15)

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Why don't you take a little time to think about what you want to say? Sometimes it can be helpful to plan out what you want to say in advance, so you don't get too nervous when you actually talk to her.
-It can be tough to ask someone out, but it sounds like you're really brave for wanting to go for it!
-I'm sure she'll be flattered that you want to take her to the dance.
-Good luck! I know you'll do great.
