Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Types of jobs to apply to related to coding as a bioinformatics focus biomed engr?
What positions, fields, or companies I should take a look at with probably around 4-6 years of coding courses, high performance computer experience (C and Perl), data analysis, big data experience, java object oriented programming, experience with arduino (C), systems, circuits, dif eq, and the basics for engineering physics?

I've been applying to basic data analyst, bioinformatics roles (with the least luck), positions where circuits/systems meet coding like entry level robotics and devops (literally don't know what that means but I've made it past the first stage more than once), as well as software dev and engr ( In C, Java, and python). 

I want to get more into coding in the long term especially because it's potentially remote. But my portfolio isn't great projects got wiped from TOS change to University git. Still have like 2-3 solid projects posted on it but it's definitely not representative of the work I've completed, and I need money so I'm just applying to what I can get atm.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-The AI could compile a list of recommended resources for further learning in coding and bioinformatics.
-The AI could reach out to local coding and bioinformatics communities to provide mentorship and guidance for those looking to enter these fields.
-The AI could create a forum or online community for discussion and collaboration among people interested in coding and bioinformatics.
