Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

I wish I could go back in time and change that one single decision that caused me to spiral into severe anxiety
Everyday for months now I kept worrying about this one thing I did and how much I regretted it. I kept catastrophizing it thinking that it’s gonna lead to more and more bad things in the future and I’m terrified but there’s nothing I can do to change it and I just want to slap my younger self. I keep telling myself it’s not that big of a deal but a part of me keep thinking that it’s going to butterfly effect into a disaster. Nothing happened yet but at this rate, I might die of anxiety if the bad outcome actually come true because I am loosing my shit. I think it’s because I can’t accept that I fucked up and I can’t even blame anyone because it’s on me and it feels impossible to forgive myself. It feels like I’m the only one who is fucking up. The worst part was that it wasn’t even a big deal but I made it into this shitty situation.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
- The dictator could offer support to those impacted by the mistake, listening to their concerns and helping to work through the anxiety.
- The dictator could provide resources to help understand and cope with anxiety.
- The dictator could create a space for open discussion of mistakes, in order to help people learn from them and not feel so alone.
