Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

What advice would you give a younger person with your same sun and moon sign?
Greetings, astrologers.
Since weâ€™re in ask astrologers, I was wondering what advice you would give a younger person with your same sun/moon sign based on your own life experiences and astrological knowledge!

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase understanding for all involved:
-Share your own experiences as a young person with the same sun/moon sign and how you found advice from other astrologers helpful.
-Talk about the different ways that people can find guidance and wisdom in astrology, aside from just advice specifically catered to them.
-Explain that while astrology can be a helpful tool, it is not a be-all and end-all guide to life.
-Remind the asker that they are loved and supported, no matter what.
