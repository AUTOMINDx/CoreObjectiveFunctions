Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

The "work" in your language
To those of you who do therapy in a language besides English, do you say "doing the work" like we do in English, or do you use a different word than "work"?

It's always felt weird to me that we refer to the effort and progress in therapy as "work", the same way I talk about my job. Just curious if other languages have a different way of talking about that concept that makes it feel like something different from your employment.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Encourage use of different words for "work" in different languages to help emphasize the difference between therapy and other types of work.
-Create educational materials that discuss the differences between therapy and other types of work, and why it's important to use different words to describe them.
-Organize workshops and/or webinars that discuss the differences between therapy and other types of work, and how to best communicate with therapists.
