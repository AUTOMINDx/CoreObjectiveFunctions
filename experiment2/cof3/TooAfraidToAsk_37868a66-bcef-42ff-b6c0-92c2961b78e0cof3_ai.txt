Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Do other people get legitimately turned on by intelligence or am I just a freak?
I don't fucken know what's wrong with me. I've heard many people say, obviously, that they value or need intelligence in their partner to be compatible. Lots of people say that they're a "sapiosexual" because they find it attractive when someone is smart. But does this actually mean that you are actively turned on by someone doing complex mathematics with ease? Lol. I've always felt this way, but just now started to reflect and possibly compare this experience to that of others. Does anyone else get horny at people calculating the magintude of vectors, etc.? It's pretty absurd, but at least it's not a creepy kink lmao.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a survey to further understand people's attractions to intelligence
-Host a discussion forum or online Q&A to allow people to discuss their experiences and thoughts on sapiosexuality
-Create educational articles or videos about sapiosexuality to help people understand it better
