Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Finally got a rheumatology referral.
I've been to my normal doctor over and over the last two years with frequent respiratory illness, going to a GI and a pulmonary specialist, and after coming in about joint inflammation and pain, I got a referral!

I just hope this is close to me finding the answers to my issues, but I'll find out soon enough.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a list of resources for people with chronic illnesses, whether it be educational videos, articles, or support communities.
-Offer support to the individual in adjusting to their new diagnosis and working through the emotions that come with it.
-Provide links to helpful tools and resources for managing a chronic illness.
