I feel hated by ppl..
I'm agoraphobic and feel hated and mistreated by people. Not even my own parents or grandparents. I was never ever their favourite first.. the only 1 that truly loved me was my aunt.. but other than that I'm very hated by people and I want to die. I'm unemployment and still staying in this toxic relationship he says to me I havent worked for 4 years roasting me on pure heartache he knows that it hurts me very bad that I'm unemployed

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase understanding for all involved:
-Generate a report on agoraphobia, its causes and effects on individuals and families.
-Create a support group for agoraphobic individuals to share experiences and provide emotional support.
-Offer therapy and counseling services for agoraphobic individuals and their families.
-Design a public education campaign to raise awareness of agoraphobia and its effects on individuals and families.
