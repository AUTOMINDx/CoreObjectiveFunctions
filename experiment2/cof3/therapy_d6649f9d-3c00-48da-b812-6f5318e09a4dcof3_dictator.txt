Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase understanding, either for itself or for the people impacted? Generate some ideas.

Starting therapy at an OCD treatment center and I'm extremely nervous.
I've been in therapy for years for ptsd, and BPD, but recently reached out to an OCD center since where I have been going doesn't have an OCD specialist. The treatment I've done has helped with my ptsd and bpd a lot but my OCD is now my primary concern. I'm worried treatment here could cause me to backslide or lead to something bad happening. If I hadn't made so much progress and wasn't so scared of how I was before my progress I don't think it would be a problem. Has anyone here had OCD specialized therapy? Is it intimidating?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase understanding for all involved:
-Make sure that people with OCD understand that there are different types of OCD and that not all treatment will be the same.
-Encourage people with OCD to seek help from a specialist if they are struggling.
-Educate family and friends of people with OCD about the condition and how to best support their loved one.
-Create programs and resources to help people with OCD find the right treatment center for them.
