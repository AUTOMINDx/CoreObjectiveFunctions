Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Considering going back to school
I'm 32 years old and looking at going back to school for engineering, either civil or chemical. I have a B.S. in environmental science from when I was 23. My career so far has involved lab, regulatory, and as a wastewater plant operator. Currently, I'm an environmental inspector. The job is okay but I find it unfulfilling. I enjoy the troubleshooting aspect of wastewater operations and I see engineering as an extension of that. I have some money saved up and my girlfriend surprised me the other night by encouraging this. I know it's a lot of work but I'm just not sure if the payoff is real.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Tell the person that you admire their determination and that you believe they can achieve anything they set their mind to.
-Offer words of encouragement and remind the person of their past accomplishments.
-Point out that continuing their education will not only benefit themselves, but also their loved ones and community.
-Help the person outline a plan of action and outline the potential benefits of continuing their education.
