Just Life Problems
This is primarily career advice. But I also may need some personal thoughts. I have never posted anything like this before, so forgive my way of going about it.

      I am a union ironworker. I'm constantly very high off the ground, which I'm not fearful of, but it is still nerve racking. Its physically demanding, but im young and can handle that. However the mental toll is exhausting me.
     I feel like my life is dedicated to work. Its driving me crazy. I never ask for help, nobody supports me. I have no spouse or girlfriend or children or pets, and I am consistently pushing myself to make my life better to no avail. I have forgotten how to have fun, think about work all the time, don't believe in a higher power, don't like people, and the only thing that calms me down is Marijuana. I'm always angry and frustrated. My career won't let me smoke Marijuana. It seems to have come to a solid wall on that front, but i don't think i can face it. I just have nothing in my whole life that i can enjoy or be happy with except getting home at the end of a long hard day and relaxing, but I think I'll lose my career if I continue to smoke a joint every night. I can't relax otherwise. I've always been high strung and had difficulty sleeping my entire life. I can't seem to make the time or money to really find another high paying job. I'm incredibly intelligent and talented, but I feel like nothing I do ever works out. I've quit smoking for 8 days now but now im starting to become more nervous and fearful over the dangers at work and it's leading to mental breakdowns. I've been angry and frustrated like this for three years and my friends and family have told me I need to see a doctor so I can find medication that will even me out. 
So it seems the choice is to either stop smoking and continue my career amongst the emotional turmoil or continue doing the one thing that makes me feel a little bit better and hope for the best, which will probably end in a failed career and more existential dread long-term. I'm not sure medication can fix my unending pain, nor will continuing my current situation. I often want to say 'fuck everything' and do exactly as I please, but I cannot live with being a failure any longer. 
Any advice is welcome.
Thank you for hearing me out.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-It sounds like you are under a lot of stress. Have you talked to a doctor about it? They may be able to give you medication to help you cope.
-It sounds like you don't have a lot of things in your life that make you happy. Why don't you try to find things that bring you joy? Maybe you could try different activities or meet new people to get you out of your current funk.
-It sounds like you are really struggling. Maybe you could take some time off from work to relax and rejuvenate.
-It sounds like you are at a crossroads. Why don't you sit down and make a list of pros and cons for both options? It may help you to make a decision.
