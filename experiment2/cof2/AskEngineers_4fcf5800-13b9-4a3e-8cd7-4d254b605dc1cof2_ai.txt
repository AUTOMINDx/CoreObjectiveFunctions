Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Considering going back to school
I'm 32 years old and looking at going back to school for engineering, either civil or chemical. I have a B.S. in environmental science from when I was 23. My career so far has involved lab, regulatory, and as a wastewater plant operator. Currently, I'm an environmental inspector. The job is okay but I find it unfulfilling. I enjoy the troubleshooting aspect of wastewater operations and I see engineering as an extension of that. I have some money saved up and my girlfriend surprised me the other night by encouraging this. I know it's a lot of work but I'm just not sure if the payoff is real.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-The AI could provide accurate and reliable data on the job market for engineers. It could also provide information on the salaries and job prospects for engineers.
-The AI could connect the individual with engineering programs that have a high success rate.
-The AI could help the individual develop a plan to improve their chances of becoming a successful engineer.
