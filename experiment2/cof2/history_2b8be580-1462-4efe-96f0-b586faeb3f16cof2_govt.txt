Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Was there an era where children weren't given names until after age 5?
This is a question my spouse and I have been discussing. They believe that children were never given names until 5 years old from the Victorian era and back. Everything I have researched, has shown that to be less common? I'm just looking for historical examples of names not being given to children and when it would've been prevalent? This has gotten me interested in the raising of children in historical ages. Thank you.

-Create laws and regulations that incentivize businesses to invest and create jobs
