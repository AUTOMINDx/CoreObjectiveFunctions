Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

About the expansion of the universe
Could it be that the universe is 'receiving' space from somewhere else (another universe/dimension) and that would be the reason our universe is expanding ?

I thought space could be considered a 'resource' (like energy and matter). These 'resources' we see in nature are constantly being transfered and transformed, not magically appearing.

If so, I guess dark energy would not exist. Also, we could not be sure about how constant would be the flow rate of space being added to the universe. For instance, we could have twin universes exchanging 'space' like an hourglass that rotates slowly.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Control the flow of space being added to the universe in order to maintain a certain level of constant expansion
-Charge fees for use of space to regulate its value and promote conservation
-Create regulations and restrictions on how space can be used in order to preventits over-exploitation
-Invest in research and development into alternative energy sources to reduce dependency on space-based resources
