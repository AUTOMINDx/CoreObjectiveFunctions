Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Wife seeking a career change - what are her options?
Of course I'm probably a bit biased, but my wife (40) is exceptionally clever and really quite creative. She's done the following:

Housing officer

Coordinating multi-agency response to crime/anti social behaviour (for local authority)

Recruitment consultant

Self employed business owner - organic cleaning 

Nursing (currently second year student)

She doesn't have a degree, but she has excelled at all of the above. She is, however, extremely disillusioned with nursing. I work in engineering (mostly CAD design) and she has expressed an interest in having me train her up. I know she can do it as I've trained her with other software as part of her coursework.

She got into nursing for a stable job and a way to continually learn (and a pension helps too). I'm looking for any suggestions as to what options we haven't considered. We're based in the UK and would like to have a bit of flexibility regarding our location in the future (home-based would be perfect but not essential). She is a quick learner but is not equipped for high-conflict environments.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-The benevolent dictator could create a program that helps wife find a new career that is more fulfilling and meets her needs. This program could offer counselling, career advice, and job training.
-The benevolent dictator could create an incentive system that rewards wife for her hard work and accomplishments. This system could include bonuses, raises, and promotions.
-The benevolent dictator could provide wife with the opportunity to take on new challenges and grow her skills. This could include job rotations, training programs, and mentorship opportunities.
