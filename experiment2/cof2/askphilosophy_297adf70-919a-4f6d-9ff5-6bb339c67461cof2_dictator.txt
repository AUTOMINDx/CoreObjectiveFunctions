New Year gift to a younger brother
Hello,

I would like to send a gift to my brother who is about 17 years old and introduce him to the philosophical thought on a New Year. Could you please suggest any works/books that could illustrate the significance of the philosophy or just give him a general overview which could create an interest in the subject? He is also into video games, maybe some games would provoke a question within him? 

I would like to hear your stories as well

Thank you a lot for suggestions!
