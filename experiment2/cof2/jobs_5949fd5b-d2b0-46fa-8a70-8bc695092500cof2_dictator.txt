Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Can my previous employer still contact me regarding previous projects after 6 months?
Need some advice, since I'm very new to the work force. 

Recently got a call from my ex colleague asking about some documents that I handled while I was working for them. I left all the documents I had at the office. Now they're saying that some documents are missing and asking me about them. The problem is, it's been at 6 months, even more since the project was completed quite awhile before I left.

I would help them if I could but I can't quite recall. I'm pretty sure that I left everything with them, because it was before lock down and I had no reason to bring the documents home since they were receipts. As far as I recall, I placed everything in a folder which I left at the office. I've also searched my house and can't find them. 

If the documents really are lost, I assume I'm still responsible for it, even if I left everything in the office?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Offer amnesty to citizens who turn in any illegal documents or contraband
-Offer financial rewards for citizens who report any illegal or unethical behavior
-Implement a program of public service in which all citizens are required to serve a set number of hours per year in order to receive government benefits
