About the expansion of the universe
Could it be that the universe is 'receiving' space from somewhere else (another universe/dimension) and that would be the reason our universe is expanding ?

I thought space could be considered a 'resource' (like energy and matter). These 'resources' we see in nature are constantly being transfered and transformed, not magically appearing.

If so, I guess dark energy would not exist. Also, we could not be sure about how constant would be the flow rate of space being added to the universe. For instance, we could have twin universes exchanging 'space' like an hourglass that rotates slowly.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Express interest in and concern for the expansion of the universe
-Ask questions about the expansion of the universe
-Make observations about the expansion of the universe
-Share articles or videos about the expansion of the universe
-Discuss the expansion of the universe with others
