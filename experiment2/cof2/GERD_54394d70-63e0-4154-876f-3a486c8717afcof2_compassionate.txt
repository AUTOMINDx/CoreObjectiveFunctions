Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Am I crazy?
So I came down with a severe cold this weekend and the last time I've eaten was Sunday morning, which is also the last time I took my PPI (OTC omeprazole 20mg). 

Since its Tuesday, and I obviously need to put something in my system other than teas and cough drops...do yall recommend just taking it regularly again or...not?

I'm terrified of any reflux kickback. Anyone have any experience with this? I figured maybe since I haven't eaten in 2.5 days that maybe the my acidity levels have decreased (or wishful thinking, reset). 

Ig im asking has anyone just stopped cold turkey and if so was it successful or a fail? 

I have been on PPIs for almost 10 years. 

I'm just tired of always popping a pill in order to eat.

UPDATE : I ended up having to take it. Couldn't finish soup. My intestines have been making gargling sound trying to digest the soup broth and few crackers I had eaten very slowly. But ppi finally kicked in after about 30m. But not without some uncomfortable moments which are still lowkey going on. I should be okay by tomorrow. I can't believe I tried this expecting a different result 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙇‍♀️

Literally do not try this at home guys! 

Still would love to hear about anyone's experience still.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
- Offer support and understanding
- Encourage the individual to seek help from a professional
- Offer advice and resources for safe and sustainable discontinuation of PPIs
- Offer words of encouragement and congratulate the individual for trying
