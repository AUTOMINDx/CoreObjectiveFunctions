What made you realize you’ve outgrown your friends, and was the “breakups” ugly or cordial?

25 years old and Been really self improving the last year in a half. Lost 90 pounds and have been working out consistently for 1yr+, changed my career goals, going back to school as well as managing 2 side hustles. 

My friends don’t seem to understand me anymore and they think I’m just money driven, maybe that’s the case tbh but I don’t think it’s bad that I want more for myself. 

I don’t really care about the same things as before that we had in common. And they kind of spend the majority of their time talking negatively about mutual people, and it’s tiring and a waste of time to be around to be honest. 

What’s your guys experiences?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Thank you for being honest and speaking up about the situation. It sounds like you have outgrown your friends, and it can be tough to go through a break-up, especially with people you have known for a long time. 
-I am sorry to hear that you don't feel like you have anything in common with them anymore. It can be difficult when friends don't share the same interests. 
-It sounds like you have been really self-improving in the last year and a half. That is really admirable! You should be proud of yourself. 
-I hope you can find new friends who will appreciate and support your goals and ambitions. It's important to have people in your life who make you feel good and inspire you to be your best self.
