Depersonalization or depression?
I want to start this off by saying I have experienced depersonalization before, as a teen and it is usually acute episodes that lasts no more than an hour. However last week, I smoked quite a bit of weed (not out of the ordinary for me) and had a pleasant experience. However a few days later after doing some body spiritual work, I stood up, and immediately felt different. Nothing around me felt real, I felt removed. Since then it has been on and off, but mainly on. I guess the confusing part is when I do feel like this I feel extremely sad, guilty, worthless, and down right suicidal. I honestly can’t tell if I’m depressed again or it’s depersonalization, or both. I’ve experienced colors being dull and feeling like I’m in a story, and my inner monologue being quiet each time I’m depressed, so it’s really hard to tell. I just want my life back. That’s all… advice and thoughts would be extremely helpful.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Encourage people to seek help if they are experiencing depersonalization or depression.
-Provide resources and support for those who are struggling with depersonalization or depression.
