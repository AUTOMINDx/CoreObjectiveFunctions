I NEED HELP ASAP PLZ!!!
why do some guys (not saying all) think getting attached/clingy to their girlfriend is what their girlfriends want? And how do I confront my bf that I don't like it?

Storytime: me and my bf started dating a week or 2 ago. with him, i'm his first gf but for me he's my 3rd bf. with the previous bf's i had, he is an opposite to them (he's a innocent boy). i never get along with clingy people and when i meet them, i normally distance myself away from them. my bf asked why i haven't been saying much to him lately but i don't want to tell him that i don't like how clingy he is and hurt his feelings. but if i don't tell him, he'll just keep doing it.

like i know he's a beginner with dating, but i think setting some ground rules will help him learn.

idk what to do, plz help :)

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Tell your boyfriend that you would like him to take things a little slower and to not text or call you as often. Explain that you are not comfortable with clingy people and would like him to give you some space.
-Encourage your boyfriend to learn about healthy relationships by reading articles or books about them.
-Suggest that your boyfriend finds someone to talk to about relationships, whether that be a friend, family member, or therapist. This can help him to learn more about how to act in a healthy and respectful way with future partners.
