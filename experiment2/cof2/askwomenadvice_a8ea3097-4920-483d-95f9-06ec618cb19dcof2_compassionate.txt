Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What did you do when your BF said he doesn’t know if he wanna stay with you ? Both in our late 20’s and been together for few years now but not living together. Feeling numb and sad with the whole situation.
If your BF is in place not knowing if he still wanna be with you, what would you do ? Still call, text, ask for seeing each other ? Or let him deal with himself ? 

We are in our late 20s and been together for few years now (not living together). I’m afraid if I don’t try anything he will be used to not having me in his life and make the decision to break up. 

I don’t know what to do and being honest, this situation makes me feel so sad (like a big weight in my heart).

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Send a text or call your BF to let him know you still care about him and want to support him however you can.
-Offer to meet up with him to talk about what he’s going through.
-Write him a letter expressing your support and love for him.
-Invite him to spend time with you and your friends.
