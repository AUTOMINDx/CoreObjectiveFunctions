Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What is existential psychotherapy?
I have just finished 3 months of therapy with a charity in the UK, and the psychotherapist I saw there made me a shortlist of psychotherapists he thought would be suitable to carry on working with me. 

One of the guys he recommended (who I have booked a consultation with) describes himself as an existential psychotherapist. Can anyone explain in simple terms what this means? I have tried Googling but still not quite grasping it!

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Encourage and incentivize therapy and other forms of self-care
-Promote and fund research on mental health and well-being
-Provide support and resources for those struggling with mental illness or struggling with existential crises
-Create and enforce laws and regulations that protect mental health and well-being
