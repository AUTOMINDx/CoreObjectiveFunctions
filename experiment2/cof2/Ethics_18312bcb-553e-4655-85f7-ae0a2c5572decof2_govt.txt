Why playfulness is a precondition for serious thinking
Hi all,  


I am an MA student of philosophy at KU Leuven, Belgium (formerly in London). In the last couple of years I have found more and more that individuals, especially highly educated ones, seem to conflate the seriousness of the topic with treating the topic seriously. However, it is my understanding that thoughts and especially deep thinking requires 'a spirit of playfulness' especially at certain intervals.  


That is why I have written this brief article on this issue which can be treated as a preface towards a (future) more systematic account: [https://defatihkilic.medium.com/why-playfulness-is-a-precondition-for-serious-thinking-33ac94066f57](https://defatihkilic.medium.com/why-playfulness-is-a-precondition-for-serious-thinking-33ac94066f57)  


Thank you all for your time!
