Anyone wanna befriend me?
I wish I had someone I can talk and relate to, so we won't feel so alone.. I have family but they dont really understand. I am grateful they try and all but I miss social interaction. I havent had a friend especially physically in years do to social anxiety and never a reason to leave the house. I had one friend but they faded away (╯︵╰,)

- Say that you understand how they feel, and that you're there for them if they need someone to talk to.
- Offer to be their friend, and promise to stay in touch.
- Suggest meeting up for coffee or lunch to get to know each other better.
- Encourage them to take some time for themselves to relax and de-stress.
- Remind them that they are valuable and important, and that they have something to offer the world.
