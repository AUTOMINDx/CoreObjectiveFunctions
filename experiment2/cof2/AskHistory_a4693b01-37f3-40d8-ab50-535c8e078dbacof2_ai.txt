Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

How do we know how old Gobekli Tepe is? Trying to disprove someone who thinks carbon dating is a complete sham.
Gobekli Tepe is currently dated around 12,000 years old, but someone I know is in denial of this as they believe humanity was created around 6000 years ago (Biblical chronology believer). They assert that Gobekli Tepe (and all other sites that prove human existence) dated over 6000 years are not valid as they rely on carbon dating. I'm not an expert by any means, and would appreciate any sources that prove the age of historical sites 6000+ years that do not rely on carbon dating, or how Tepe is currently being dated. Thank you in advance.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Give people accurate information about the history of the world and human existence
-Encourage critical thinking and analyze information objectively
-Provide resources and education about scientific methods and carbon dating
