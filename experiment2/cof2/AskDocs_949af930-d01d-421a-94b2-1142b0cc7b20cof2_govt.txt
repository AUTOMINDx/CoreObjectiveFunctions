Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Would a CT scan with only IV contrast show colorectal cancer?
Some background: I am a 29 yo female having some bowel issues for months after being diagnosed with cdiff back in April (after delivering my daughter). After 6 months of recurrences, doc sent me for a CT scan to rule out colitis, which came back negative and everything was unremarkable. For the bowel segment it states mild stool burden with no bowel wall thickening or obstruction. About a month later I tested negative for Cdiff. Sounds good right? The only thing is I am still having symptoms. 

The doctor thinks it is just PI IBS and I should give it time. My main concern is that my bowel movements are still mushy and yellow/ orangey brown in color and I thought I might have had a spot of very light pink blood on the toilet tissue this morning. It was hard to tell where it came from (I am expecting my period in a day or so, so it was possibly uterine bleeding). I am just freaking out that I have colorectal cancer or something terrible that is going undiagnosed. 

Would a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with ONLY IV CONTRAST show bowel or rectal cancer? 

I know CTs arenâ€™t as good as colonoscopy but it would give me some piece of mind to know it would have likely been picked up on my CT scan if it were cancer.
