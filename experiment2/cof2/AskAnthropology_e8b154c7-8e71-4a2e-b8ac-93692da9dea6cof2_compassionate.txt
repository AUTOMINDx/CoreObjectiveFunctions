Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Assemblage Theory?
In my anthropology class there is a group project in which I got assigned to writing about the wider "assemblage" of faucets. I understand that an assemblage in assemblage theory is a sort of collection of ideas relating to the topic that provides commentary on society, culture, etc. But is there a good example of an assemblage that I can use to get an idea of what mine should look like?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-I'm sorry that you got assigned to write about a topic that you don't understand. Maybe I can help you out.
-Are you having any trouble finding examples of assemblages to use in your project? I can help you find some if you need.
-Your project sounds really interesting! I'm sure you'll do a great job writing it.
