Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What’s the best way to build a fairly complete overview of WWII?
I’m looking for documentaries/ books/ etc as I’m new to studying history and I realized I don’t know nearly as much about the non American pop culture side of things as I should. I’d prefer series/ movies/ books that accurately cover a broad overview of the what and why so I can then decide what specific events I want to focus on in more detail.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Generate public awareness of the benefits of studying history.
- Fund educational programs that focus on the importance of understanding history.
- Encourage citizens to read historical fiction and nonfiction books to learn more about different cultures and events.
- Provide subsidies and tax breaks to businesses and citizens who invest in historical collections and preservation.
