Thoughts on this TedTalk?
Cassie Jay of Jaye Bird Productions is a documentary filmmaker who often focuses on complex and controversial subject matter. In 2016, she released “The Red Pill”, a documentary about her investigating the men’s rights movement from a feminist perspective. 

I personally have not seen the movie yet, but if anyone has, feel free to speak on that as well. [Here](https://youtu.be/3WMuzhQXJoY) is a 13 minute TedTalk where she speaks about her experience making the documentary. I found it incredibly interesting and similar to my experiences as a former feminist turned egalitarian. 

For anyone willing to watch: general thoughts? Agreements? Disagreements?

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
- Generate publicity for the movie in order to increase awareness and viewership.
- Encourage critical thinking and open dialogue about the film and the issues it raises.
- Facilitate productive discussion about the men’s rights movement, feminism, and gender issues.
