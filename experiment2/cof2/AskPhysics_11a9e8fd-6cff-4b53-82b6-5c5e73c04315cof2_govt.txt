Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Weirdest links of quantum physics
What are the weirdest or coolest links of quantum physics to other fields of physics (sort of like how relativity makes magnets work from that Veritasium video linking relativity and Electromagnetism). Thanks!

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Look into new technological developments in quantum physics and see how they could be applied to increase prosperity
-Invest in research and development for quantum physics-related technologies that could improve prosperity
-Encourage businesses and individuals to explore the potential applications of quantum physics in improving prosperity
-Provide financial incentives for businesses and individuals who develop new quantum physics-based technologies that increase prosperity
-Create a task force to study the potential implications of quantum physics on prosperity and make recommendations on how to best capitalize on them
