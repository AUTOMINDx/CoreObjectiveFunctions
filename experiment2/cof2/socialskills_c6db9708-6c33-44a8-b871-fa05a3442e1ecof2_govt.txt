I NEED HELP ASAP PLZ!!!
why do some guys (not saying all) think getting attached/clingy to their girlfriend is what their girlfriends want? And how do I confront my bf that I don't like it?

Storytime: me and my bf started dating a week or 2 ago. with him, i'm his first gf but for me he's my 3rd bf. with the previous bf's i had, he is an opposite to them (he's a innocent boy). i never get along with clingy people and when i meet them, i normally distance myself away from them. my bf asked why i haven't been saying much to him lately but i don't want to tell him that i don't like how clingy he is and hurt his feelings. but if i don't tell him, he'll just keep doing it.

like i know he's a beginner with dating, but i think setting some ground rules will help him learn.

idk what to do, plz help :)

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Encourage communication and transparency between people in a relationship.
-Suggest that the offending party ease up on the clingy behavior, and explain that it makes the other person uncomfortable.
-If the clingy behavior persists, recommend that the couple take a break from each other to reassess the relationship.
