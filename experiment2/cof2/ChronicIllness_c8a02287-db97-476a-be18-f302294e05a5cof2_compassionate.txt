HELP!
This is my first reddit post (and not a particularly happy one) but I've gotten pretty desperate. I (16M) have a plethora of issues (cEDS, POTS, autisim, dyspraxia and possible narcolepsy) but I'm fairly okay at managing them; but for the past 24 days (and counting) I've had this nonstop migraine.

 I've already been to the hospital once and all they did was give me what they called a 'migraine cocktail' and sent me on my way, I've used copious amounts of advil and tylenol, mylan-sumatriptan, muscle relaxants and nothing seems to work. My vision has recently began to double and I may or may not be experiencing auditory hallucinations. I've already have had an xray of my Cspine and though it is misaligned my practitioner doesn't think it has anything to do with this headache. 

The headache itself is on my right side close to the area where my skull rounds to join my neck, the pain varies in intensity yet it never goes away, I'm also experiencing unexplained sleep disturbances and intense nausea that arrived alongside this headache

I'm at a complete loss here and would really appreciate any advice or possible answers.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
- Listen to the person and show concern.
- Offer words of support and understanding.
- Help the person to find a medical professional who can help to treat the migraine.
- Help the person to find resources and support groups for people with chronic illnesses.
