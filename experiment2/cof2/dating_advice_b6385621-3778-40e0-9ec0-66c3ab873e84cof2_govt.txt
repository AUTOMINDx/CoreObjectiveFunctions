Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Just learned that the guy I have a date with soon doesn’t look how I thought he looked: Update, months later
This is an update to a post I made here, that got a LOT of traction. You can go on my profile to check it out. It’s my only other post!

We had some bumps in the road (unrelated to his looks, lol), but we’re still dating and he is such a sweetheart and very attractive. He’s actually picking me up from the airport tomorrow, as I went to my hone state visit my mom for thanksgiving. He makes me incredibly happy, and I hope we last.

****Let this be a lesson girls, to not 100% cross a guy off on dating apps because he doesn’t photograph well. There are some cute guys out there that don’t know their angles/haven’t taken a recent photo in forever.

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Offer tax breaks to businesses that invest in research and development
-Create incentives for businesses to export their products
-Provide grants or low-interest loans to entrepreneurs who want to start their own business
-Reduce tariffs on imported goods
-Lower the cost of electricity and natural gas for businesses
