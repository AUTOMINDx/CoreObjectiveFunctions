Employees Keep Asking Me to do Delegated Tasks
I was promoted to a manager role a year ago  I work in Healthcare and lead a team of nurse practitioners. In addition to managing the nurse practitioners I also manage a group of registered nurses. 

For more background I'm a nurse practioner and in addition to supervision I do some clinical tasks as well. Given the supervisor tasks that comes with my job, the clinical or patient care workload is smaller than the other nurse practioners. 

A problem that I have are a few team members who ask me to do tasks I delegate to them or ask me why don't I do it when I delegate tasks. This includes working holidays and weekends. This also includes taking on another person's tasks if they quit. I do help out as appropriate if someone calls out sick.

When I interviewed for the job I was informed that working holidays or weekends wasn't required. My other job responsibilities were also discussed prior to starting and I follow that. Has anyone every dealt with employees asking you to do tasks delegated to them? Any advice on how to deal with this?
