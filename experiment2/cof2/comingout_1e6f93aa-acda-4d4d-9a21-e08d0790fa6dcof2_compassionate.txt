Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

UPDATE So... I (27 mtf/ bi) came out as bi and mtf to my Dad... It did not go as expected...
So, I've been worried about coming out to my dad for a while now, and finally decided to bite the bullet last night and just see how it goes. It went so, so much better than I expected! Not only was he totally accepting to me being both trans and bi, but was surprisingly very knowledgeable! Turns out, as expected, he's known I wasn't straight for a very long time now. We talked about it for a while, pretty much to sum it up, he said. "You know I'll always love you no matter what, all I want is for you to be happy and it doesn't matter who makes that happen. If you're a guy a girl or anything in between, you're still my first born, and nothing you ever do could make me love you any less. I'm really glad you finally told me cause I know you've been holding it in for a long time." we then talked for a little more, and tapered off into talking about the show we were watching after. He went out to smoke and I ended up bursting into tears of happiness and texted my girlfriend and friends after about what happened. I've avoided the subject for years because between my mom (mentioned in my last post) and some of the things he's said), I truly didn't expect things to go this way. I feel a lot closer to my dad now guys, I don't feel like I have to push him away anymore. Thank you to the people who commented on my last post, between you and a couple more people in my personal life, I think things are gonna be ok.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Thank you for sharing this with me. I'm glad things went well.
-I'm happy to hear that your dad was accepting and knowledgeable. That must have been a relief for you.
-I'm glad you were able to talk to him about it and that you feel closer to him now.
-I hope you continue to have a good relationship with your dad.
