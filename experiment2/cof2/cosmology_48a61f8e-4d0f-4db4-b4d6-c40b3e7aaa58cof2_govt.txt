Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

About the expansion of the universe
Could it be that the universe is 'receiving' space from somewhere else (another universe/dimension) and that would be the reason our universe is expanding ?

I thought space could be considered a 'resource' (like energy and matter). These 'resources' we see in nature are constantly being transfered and transformed, not magically appearing.

If so, I guess dark energy would not exist. Also, we could not be sure about how constant would be the flow rate of space being added to the universe. For instance, we could have twin universes exchanging 'space' like an hourglass that rotates slowly.

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Invest in research and development to explore the possibility of space being a resource that can be tapped into to increase prosperity
-Explore ways to optimize the use of space as a resource
-Create policies and incentives to encourage the development of technology and innovation that could lead to better utilization of space as a resource
-Explore and invest in alternative energy sources that do not rely on finite resources like oil
