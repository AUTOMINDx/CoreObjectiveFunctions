Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

**TRIGGER WARNING**
Hello, I made a friend recently. We’ve been through a lot of the same experiences. I’m trying to help them, and it seems to make a bit of a difference.
But they go on so much about their suicidal thoughts. I don’t mean to sound insensitive. I’ve dealt with the exact same thing. The last time I felt suicidal was over two years ago, but after the constant paragraphs of messages about depression, it’s got me very triggered. This resulted in a major event recently and has gotten me really jacked up.

I really want to distance myself from this person, but I don’t want to ditch them. But I just cannot sacrifice so much of myself to only help another person a little bit.

Does anyone have any advice at all? It seems I’m one of their only friends so it’s really hard. I truly care about this person, but it’s so hard on myself I’m really struggling. I’m scared of going back to major depressive episodes. There’s a few things that go on in my life that influence that, but hearing the details of someone else’s stories unfortunately greatly influences mine.

I have no idea what to do, does anyone have any advice or experience with this?
