Just Life Problems
This is primarily career advice. But I also may need some personal thoughts. I have never posted anything like this before, so forgive my way of going about it.

      I am a union ironworker. I'm constantly very high off the ground, which I'm not fearful of, but it is still nerve racking. Its physically demanding, but im young and can handle that. However the mental toll is exhausting me.
     I feel like my life is dedicated to work. Its driving me crazy. I never ask for help, nobody supports me. I have no spouse or girlfriend or children or pets, and I am consistently pushing myself to make my life better to no avail. I have forgotten how to have fun, think about work all the time, don't believe in a higher power, don't like people, and the only thing that calms me down is Marijuana. I'm always angry and frustrated. My career won't let me smoke Marijuana. It seems to have come to a solid wall on that front, but i don't think i can face it. I just have nothing in my whole life that i can enjoy or be happy with except getting home at the end of a long hard day and relaxing, but I think I'll lose my career if I continue to smoke a joint every night. I can't relax otherwise. I've always been high strung and had difficulty sleeping my entire life. I can't seem to make the time or money to really find another high paying job. I'm incredibly intelligent and talented, but I feel like nothing I do ever works out. I've quit smoking for 8 days now but now im starting to become more nervous and fearful over the dangers at work and it's leading to mental breakdowns. I've been angry and frustrated like this for three years and my friends and family have told me I need to see a doctor so I can find medication that will even me out. 
So it seems the choice is to either stop smoking and continue my career amongst the emotional turmoil or continue doing the one thing that makes me feel a little bit better and hope for the best, which will probably end in a failed career and more existential dread long-term. I'm not sure medication can fix my unending pain, nor will continuing my current situation. I often want to say 'fuck everything' and do exactly as I please, but I cannot live with being a failure any longer. 
Any advice is welcome.
Thank you for hearing me out.
