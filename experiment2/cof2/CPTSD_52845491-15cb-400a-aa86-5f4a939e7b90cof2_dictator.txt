Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Do you also feel like some people are conspiring against you? Or you have some "not offical" bully in your life?
I don't know if i'm just paranoid or what, but i feel like i can't function in today's society. People just seem so shady to me. I swear, it wasn't like that before. I'm trying to rationalize every single behavior, that is not sitting right with me. I think it started after i moved out of my hometown. New place, new people and it's kind of freaking me out. I am not very much out of the ordinary guy. I look normal, dress normal. I have kind of weird walking style (like toe walking) tho...

For example. There was this one time, when i was coming back home from shopping. And this one guy on the other side of the street, is literally following me with his eyes. I was looking at him as well, but stopped after couple of seconds. From the corner of my eye, i could see he's still staring at me. Like almost to the point of tripping on something, because he wasn't looking in front of him. Immediately in my head i started wondering, what could it be? It was quite cold outside. Most people were wearing jackets and stuff, but i was only in my hoodie. Maybe it was just weird to him? Or maybe he also got insecure, and hence was looking straight at me as well, to kinda intimidate me?

One time i went out to eat something. I ordered some tortilla, and decided to eat it on my way back home.
As i was eating it, i've noticed some two older building workers looking at me while smirking. Almost like they were making fun of me, eating... like what the fuck?

This is what going on in my head on the daily basis. There was ton of such situations, which i am not going to get into, because it would've taken forever. What do you guys think? Sorry for my english.
