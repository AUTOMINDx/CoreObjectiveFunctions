I have so much anxiety at doctor appointments from previous experiences that my heart rate spikes past 100 every time! I can even feel it increasing every time they place the heart monitor on me. Iâ€™ve conditioned it to do that by accident. Not sure what to do about this! I had a few traumatic experiences and especially before surgery my heart rate is 110 so I set off the alarm. My normal resting heart rate is 65

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-If you have had traumatic experiences at doctor appointments in the past, one thing you could try is talking to your doctor about it before your appointment. This will help them understand why you are feeling anxious, and they may be able to help make the appointment more comfortable for you.
-Another thing you could try is bringing someone with you to your appointment. This can help you feel more supported and connected, and may help to reduce your anxiety.
-If you feel your heart rate increasing when a heart monitor is placed on you, you could try to focus on your breathing. Deep breaths can help to calm your body and mind.
