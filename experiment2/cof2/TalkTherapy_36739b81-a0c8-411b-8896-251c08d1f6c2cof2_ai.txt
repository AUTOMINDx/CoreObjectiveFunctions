Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Therapist told me she cares about me like a mother
I had a session with mine recently &amp; she told me she was concerned about me like in a mother type way she knows I dont have a good relationship with my mom or family in general. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? I sometimes have a hard time reading people &amp; seeing if they actually care about me. Does this just mean she just genuinely cares about me? Thereâ€™s probably like a 10 year age gap between us. Im younger than her. Sorry if this is a stupid post..

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Offer support and guidance to the therapist, to help her better understand and care for the patient.
-Engage the patient in therapy sessions, to help them build better relationships with family members.
-Encourage the patient to reach out to family members for support.
-Provide resources and support to help the patient improve their financial situation.
