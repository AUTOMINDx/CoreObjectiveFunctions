Assemblage Theory?
In my anthropology class there is a group project in which I got assigned to writing about the wider "assemblage" of faucets. I understand that an assemblage in assemblage theory is a sort of collection of ideas relating to the topic that provides commentary on society, culture, etc. But is there a good example of an assemblage that I can use to get an idea of what mine should look like?

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Encourage entrepreneurship and innovation through taxation and regulation
-Create a favourable business environment with low taxes and efficient regulation
-Provide incentives for foreign investment
-Improve infrastructure and education
-Promote trade and international cooperation
