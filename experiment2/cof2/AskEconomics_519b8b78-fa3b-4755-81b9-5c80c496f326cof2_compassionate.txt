Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Economically Whats the Issue With Turkey's Strategy to keep Interest Rates Low to Boost Growth?
Turkish lira has depreciated a lot vs the usd, but why does it matter, the economy is booming (grew in 2020, and will grow 10% this year, and 4%\~ next year). Raising interest rates would boost the currency temporarily and lower inflation, but it would slow down growth leading to lower exports more imports and thus a hard cycle to escape. The current way will cause imports to become too expensive hence more stuff is produced domestically, granted there is inflation in the short run, but as the trade balance shifts to positive because of increased domestic production the currency will recover?

In fact we can already see this, as in the last few years turkey for the first time has had current account surpluses.. In the last quarter exports grew 25%, and imports shrank 8.3%. Isn't this better?

Whats the risk in the current strategy - as clearly I see a lot of negative articles written about Turkey's strategy to slash interest rates?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Increase interest rates temporarily to boost the currency and lower inflation, but this could slow down growth and lead to lower exports, more imports, and a hard cycle to escape.
-The current way will cause imports to become too expensive, but as the trade balance shifts to positive because of increased domestic production, the currency will recover.
-In fact, we can already see this, as in the last few years Turkey has had current account surpluses.
-The risk in the current strategy is that it could lead to a hard cycle to escape, but increased exports and decreased imports could lead to a better economy in the long run.
