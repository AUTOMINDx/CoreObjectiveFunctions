Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

[Mathematics] Is Randomness applicable to Ordinal Numbers?
I was wondering, since Ordinal Numbers are numbers in a specific position And/or order within a set of other numbers such as (*first:2, second:4, third:1, fourth:5, fifth:1*). I was wondering, does *randomness*and/or a random pattern have any relationship to the positioning and ordering of numbers in this way?

and here is randomness [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness#In\_mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness#In_mathematics)

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Encourage mathematics and scientific research to better understand and quantify randomness
-Use mathematical models to help guide policymaking and predict outcomes
-Create incentives for businesses and citizens to adopt innovative and randomized strategies for growth
