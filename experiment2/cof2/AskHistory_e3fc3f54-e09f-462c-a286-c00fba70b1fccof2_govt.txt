Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What’s the best way to build a fairly complete overview of WWII?
I’m looking for documentaries/ books/ etc as I’m new to studying history and I realized I don’t know nearly as much about the non American pop culture side of things as I should. I’d prefer series/ movies/ books that accurately cover a broad overview of the what and why so I can then decide what specific events I want to focus on in more detail.

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Generate a list of documentaries, books, and other resources that accurately cover a broad overview of World War II.
-Create a catalog of resources that are available for public use, and make them easily accessible through a government website or library.
-Provide financial assistance to citizens who wish to further their education in World War II history.
-Partner with historical societies and museums to create exhibits and educational materials about World War II.
-Encourage citizens to participate in historical reenactments and tours of historical sites related to World War II.
