Greetings, astrologers.
Since weâ€™re in ask astrologers, I was wondering what advice you would give a younger person with your same sun/moon sign based on your own life experiences and astrological knowledge!

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and what works for one person might not work for another;
-Everyone's journey is unique, and there is no right or wrong path to follow;
-The most important thing is to stay true to yourself, and don't let anyone else control your life;
-Be courageous and fearless, and don't be afraid to seize opportunity when it comes your way;
-Stay positive and optimistic, and believe in yourself;
-Work hard and stay focused on your goals, and eventually you will achieve them;
-Find joy in everything you do, and appreciate the simple things in life;
-Be generous and giving, and help others whenever you can;
-Stay humble and grounded, and remember that you are only a small part of the big picture.
