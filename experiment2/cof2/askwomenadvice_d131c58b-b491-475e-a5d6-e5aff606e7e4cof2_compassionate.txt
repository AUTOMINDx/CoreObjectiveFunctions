Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

How do i set good boundaries with my bf and his parents when we go on a 2 week holiday next week?
How do I set good boundaries when I go on holiday with my partner and his parents?

If you have any advice of what good boundaries are, id really appreciate it. Important things to me for my wellbeing are my alone time, reading, not overeating, quiet times, gym/exercise. Being listened too and respected. (I went out with my bfs mum once and it was quite horrendous, she didnt listen to me when i said no to a few things) i really dont want this to happen again and id rather not be frustrated on holiday. I have already asked to move our room away from theirs (it was originally next door to theirsðŸ˜«)

TIA

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Tell the person that they have valid feelings and that you understand what they are going through.
-Offer practical advice on how to set boundaries with the other person.
-Suggest ways the person can spend time by themselves or with people they feel comfortable around.
-Remind the person that they are worth being respected and listened to.
