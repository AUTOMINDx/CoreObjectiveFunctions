I have so much anxiety at doctor appointments from previous experiences that my heart rate spikes past 100 every time! I can even feel it increasing every time they place the heart monitor on me. Iâ€™ve conditioned it to do that by accident. Not sure what to do about this! I had a few traumatic experiences and especially before surgery my heart rate is 110 so I set off the alarm. My normal resting heart rate is 65

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-renovation of healthcare system so appointment anxiety is reduced
-education on the warning signs of anxiety and how to deal with it
- stipends for those who experience anxiety at doctor appointments to help cover the cost of traveling or seeing a therapist
-massages or aromatherapy prior to doctor appointments to help relax the patient
