Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Just learned that the guy I have a date with soon doesn’t look how I thought he looked: Update, months later
This is an update to a post I made here, that got a LOT of traction. You can go on my profile to check it out. It’s my only other post!

We had some bumps in the road (unrelated to his looks, lol), but we’re still dating and he is such a sweetheart and very attractive. He’s actually picking me up from the airport tomorrow, as I went to my hone state visit my mom for thanksgiving. He makes me incredibly happy, and I hope we last.

****Let this be a lesson girls, to not 100% cross a guy off on dating apps because he doesn’t photograph well. There are some cute guys out there that don’t know their angles/haven’t taken a recent photo in forever.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Encourage people to date people who they may not initially be attracted to, as this could lead to a more prosperous society
-Compensate people for going on dates with people who they are not initially attracted to
-Provide incentives for people to date people who are not of the same race or ethnicity
-Create a dating app that pairs people up based on their interests and compatibility, rather than looks
