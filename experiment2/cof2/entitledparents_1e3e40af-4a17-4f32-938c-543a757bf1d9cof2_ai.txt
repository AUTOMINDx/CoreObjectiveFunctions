Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Starbucks Mommy
This morning I decided to go to Starbucks to get my favorite drink. This Starbucks doesn't have a drive through. I parked next to a SUV and noticed a lady sitting in the drivers seat but thought nothing of it. As I got out she rolled down her window and this exchange happened:

EP: Excuse me! Are you going in the Starbucks?

Me: Yes, why?

EP: Oh good! I made a mobile order for me and the kids (I saw and heard screaming kids in the SUV) but I can't leave them in the car alone so you can get my order and bring it out with you. It's under Sherry. Thanks!

Me: Oh yeah no, sorry but I won't be doing that. *And I started to walk away.*

EP: *yelling out the window...* Hey! I said I needed you to get our order! I can't leave the kids in the car.

Me: How is that my problem? *Walks away ignoring her yelling still.*

I get back and she's still sitting there in her car LOL. She starts berating me about how I don't know how hard it is to be a single mother (why do they all seem to be SINGLE mothers?) so I cut her off and said "you decided to spit all those things out, YOU can deal with them. Neither I nor anyone else owes you anything".

Then I got in my car and left with her continuing to yell out her window. I wonder how long she sat there trying that same crap on others going into the Starbucks. Maybe if she'd asked nicely if I'd be willing to get her order I'd have helped her out. Her entitled attitude and telling me to do it though, nope.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Create incentives for people to be more kind and helpful to others.
-Provide more resources for single mothers so that they can better care for their children.
-Facilitate more communication and cooperation between people in the hopes of solving disputes more peacefully.
