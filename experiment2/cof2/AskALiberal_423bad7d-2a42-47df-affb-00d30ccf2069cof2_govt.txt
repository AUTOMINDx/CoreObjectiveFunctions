Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What can realistically be done about rising prices or supply chain problems?
The rising costs Americans are experiencing for various goods, including gas, rent, etc., seems to be the major culprit behind the decrease in Biden/Dems' approval ratings in recent months. Obviously, the pandemic backed up supply chains, and that adjustment to a new equilibrium is probably going to take some time. But it seems like people just aren't content with that answer and there's a lot of talk about what this means for 2022 and beyond. Imposing Dwell Fees on shipping containers seems to have helped a bit, but what other concrete policies can the Biden Administration realistically implement to lower costs on consumer goods and speed up supply chains? Short of instituting a full-on command economy and outright conscripting people into various manufacturing and distribution jobs until the backlog is cleared, or sanctioning other countries until they do the same, I'm not sure what critics are really expecting him to do. It seems like if he doesn't do *something*, the Dems are just going to have to weather the blame for this economy through 2022 and beyond.

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Implement policies that incentivize manufacturers to produce goods domestically, such as tax breaks or subsidies
-Explore trade agreements with other countries that would increase the import of goods at a reduced tariff
-Encourage the development of innovative technologies that would reduce the cost of production or speed up the supply chain
