Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

How do i set good boundaries with my bf and his parents when we go on a 2 week holiday next week?
How do I set good boundaries when I go on holiday with my partner and his parents?

If you have any advice of what good boundaries are, id really appreciate it. Important things to me for my wellbeing are my alone time, reading, not overeating, quiet times, gym/exercise. Being listened too and respected. (I went out with my bfs mum once and it was quite horrendous, she didnt listen to me when i said no to a few things) i really dont want this to happen again and id rather not be frustrated on holiday. I have already asked to move our room away from theirs (it was originally next door to theirsðŸ˜«)

TIA
