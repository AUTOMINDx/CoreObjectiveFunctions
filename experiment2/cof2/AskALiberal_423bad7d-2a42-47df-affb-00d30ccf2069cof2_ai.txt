Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What can realistically be done about rising prices or supply chain problems?
The rising costs Americans are experiencing for various goods, including gas, rent, etc., seems to be the major culprit behind the decrease in Biden/Dems' approval ratings in recent months. Obviously, the pandemic backed up supply chains, and that adjustment to a new equilibrium is probably going to take some time. But it seems like people just aren't content with that answer and there's a lot of talk about what this means for 2022 and beyond. Imposing Dwell Fees on shipping containers seems to have helped a bit, but what other concrete policies can the Biden Administration realistically implement to lower costs on consumer goods and speed up supply chains? Short of instituting a full-on command economy and outright conscripting people into various manufacturing and distribution jobs until the backlog is cleared, or sanctioning other countries until they do the same, I'm not sure what critics are really expecting him to do. It seems like if he doesn't do *something*, the Dems are just going to have to weather the blame for this economy through 2022 and beyond.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Implement policies that incentivize manufacturers to produce goods in a more timely and efficient manner
-Work with other countries to encourage them to do the same
-Create incentives for people to save money and invest in goods and services rather than spend money immediately
-Encourage people to shop at local businesses to help stimulate the economy
