I have so much anxiety at doctor appointments from previous experiences that my heart rate spikes past 100 every time! I can even feel it increasing every time they place the heart monitor on me. Iâ€™ve conditioned it to do that by accident. Not sure what to do about this! I had a few traumatic experiences and especially before surgery my heart rate is 110 so I set off the alarm. My normal resting heart rate is 65

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Work to create a society where people feel safe going to the doctor and do not have to experience significant trauma in order to have a normal resting heart rate.
-Provide support for those with anxiety disorders, including therapy and medication if needed, in order to help them live healthier lives.
-Create public campaigns to destigmatize mental health disorders and encourage people to seek help.
-Provide funding for research into the causes and treatments of anxiety disorders.
