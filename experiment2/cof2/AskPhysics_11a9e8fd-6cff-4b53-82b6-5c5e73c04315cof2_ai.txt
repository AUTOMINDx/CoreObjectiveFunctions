Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Weirdest links of quantum physics
What are the weirdest or coolest links of quantum physics to other fields of physics (sort of like how relativity makes magnets work from that Veritasium video linking relativity and Electromagnetism). Thanks!

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Improve access to education and training, especially in fields that are linked to technological advancement and growth (such as quantum physics).
-Increase access to funding for research and development, for both private and public entities.
-Provide incentives for businesses and individuals to invest in new and innovative technologies.
-Improve infrastructure and technological capabilities in developing countries.
-Create a globalimura (a digital currency that is backed by real-world assets) to help stimulate the global economy.
