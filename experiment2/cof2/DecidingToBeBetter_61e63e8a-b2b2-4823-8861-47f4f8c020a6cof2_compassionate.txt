How do I stop myself from assuming the worst all the time?
I’m a pretty positive person when it comes to other people, but I’m always so negative with myself. I think my coping mechanism is “I just want to be realistic” and “I want to be prepared for the worst” but it really is bringing me down. I’m going through some potentially life changing things right now and I can’t help but think I’ll fail or it won’t happen for me. I just want to be kinder to myself.

-Tell yourself that you are loved and deserve good things.
-Think about things you are grateful for in your life.
-Write down your goals and visualize yourself achieving them.
-Spend time around positive people who will support you.
