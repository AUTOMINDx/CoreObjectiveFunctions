ATMEGA PCB will upload but won't execute?
Hey guys, I'm trying to make a custom PCB using the ATMEGA328PU. I've able to successfully burn bootloader and upload sketches according to the Arduino IDE (all signs look good including flashing lights on my FTDI serial adapter). Only problem is I can't actually run any code I try to upload. I'm working on running even the simplest LED code but to no avail.

All I want to do is at minimum get LED1 to flash or turn on before I start working on any other components within the PCB.

Is my schematic wrong? Wiring diagram? Code?
