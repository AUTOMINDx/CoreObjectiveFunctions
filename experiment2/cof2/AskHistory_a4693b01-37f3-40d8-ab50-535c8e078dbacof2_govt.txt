Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

How do we know how old Gobekli Tepe is? Trying to disprove someone who thinks carbon dating is a complete sham.
Gobekli Tepe is currently dated around 12,000 years old, but someone I know is in denial of this as they believe humanity was created around 6000 years ago (Biblical chronology believer). They assert that Gobekli Tepe (and all other sites that prove human existence) dated over 6000 years are not valid as they rely on carbon dating. I'm not an expert by any means, and would appreciate any sources that prove the age of historical sites 6000+ years that do not rely on carbon dating, or how Tepe is currently being dated. Thank you in advance.

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Provide education on the benefits of carbon dating and how it is used to accurately date archaeological sites.
-Create programs and incentives for archaeologists to study and excavate sites like Gobekli Tepe.
-Provide research funding to study the history and origins of humankind.
-Support museums and archaeological sites so that they can keep their exhibits up to date and educate the public on the latest findings.
