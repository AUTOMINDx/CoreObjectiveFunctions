Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Just learned that the guy I have a date with soon doesn’t look how I thought he looked: Update, months later
This is an update to a post I made here, that got a LOT of traction. You can go on my profile to check it out. It’s my only other post!

We had some bumps in the road (unrelated to his looks, lol), but we’re still dating and he is such a sweetheart and very attractive. He’s actually picking me up from the airport tomorrow, as I went to my hone state visit my mom for thanksgiving. He makes me incredibly happy, and I hope we last.

****Let this be a lesson girls, to not 100% cross a guy off on dating apps because he doesn’t photograph well. There are some cute guys out there that don’t know their angles/haven’t taken a recent photo in forever.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Your story is inspiring. I'm happy to hear you two are doing well.
-You're so lucky to have found someone who makes you happy. Wishing the two of you the best.
-That's great news! I'm happy to hear everything has worked out.
