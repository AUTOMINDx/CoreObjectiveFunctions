Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Would a CT scan with only IV contrast show colorectal cancer?
Some background: I am a 29 yo female having some bowel issues for months after being diagnosed with cdiff back in April (after delivering my daughter). After 6 months of recurrences, doc sent me for a CT scan to rule out colitis, which came back negative and everything was unremarkable. For the bowel segment it states mild stool burden with no bowel wall thickening or obstruction. About a month later I tested negative for Cdiff. Sounds good right? The only thing is I am still having symptoms. 

The doctor thinks it is just PI IBS and I should give it time. My main concern is that my bowel movements are still mushy and yellow/ orangey brown in color and I thought I might have had a spot of very light pink blood on the toilet tissue this morning. It was hard to tell where it came from (I am expecting my period in a day or so, so it was possibly uterine bleeding). I am just freaking out that I have colorectal cancer or something terrible that is going undiagnosed. 

Would a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with ONLY IV CONTRAST show bowel or rectal cancer? 

I know CTs arenâ€™t as good as colonoscopy but it would give me some piece of mind to know it would have likely been picked up on my CT scan if it were cancer.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-The AI could provide an easy to understand guide on how to improve one's diet in order to reduce the likelihood of developing colorectal cancer.
-The AI could develop a program that encourages people to get regular check-ups, including CT scans with IV contrast, to help ensure that any potential health concerns are caught early.
-The AI could work to create a society where people feel more comfortable discussing their health concerns, and are more likely to seek out medical help.
