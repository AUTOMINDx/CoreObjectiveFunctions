Had a bad night and now I can’t sleep
Really struggling the last few days. Last night dealt with nightmares and woke up shaking, hyperventilating, and drenched in sweat. Tonight has been calm, I tried to go to bed early. I can’t fall asleep and what they gave me to help with sleep isn’t doing anything. I’m hyper vigilant/alert and really bothered by every sound. It didn’t help that two neighbors in the last week had a prowler around their house which was caught on security cam. Thanks for letting me vent. I honestly feel a bit better after typing that out. It’s really mentally exhausting to try and act “normal” all day when you’re sleep deprived and panicky. I don’t have a very convincing poker face. Love to you all.
