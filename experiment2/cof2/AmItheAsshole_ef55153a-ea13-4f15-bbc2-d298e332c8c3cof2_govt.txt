AITA for playing baby shark for my 7 year old until his room was clean?
My 7 year old son hates, and I mean hates the song baby shark. Always has. And I’ve been after him for the last hour to get him to clean up his toys! So I decided that I would try to speed things along and play this song on repeat until his room was clean.

I kid you not, the kid had his room spotless in like 5 minutes, it was great! He clearly didn’t like it, and I only played the song when he got distracted from cleaning, he would let out this big dramatic sigh and he’d start cleaning again, then I’d pause it. 

Now everything is picked up and he’s got the song stuck in his head and he’s singing it under his breath, and it’s bothering his dad now. He said that if I have to use this technique, I should pick a less annoying song to play in the future. I feel kind of like a jackass now because while it worked, I don’t want to subject my kid to some kind of weird audio torture. AITA?

Edit: Reviews are mixed but I’ve decided to take my YTA rating with good grace. I’ve apologized to my son, gave him a treat for cleaning his room and now we’re watching a Goofy Movie together.

Next time I will let him pick the song and we will have a fun race game to see how much he can clean while the song is playing. 

Thank you everyone for weighing in and I hope you are having a good Monday.

Edit 2: To clarify, I asked him for an hour to clean, he didn’t do it. That’s when I started playing the song. I kept it paused while he was cleaning. I’d only play it when he slacked off. Overall I think I played through the song 1.5 times

Edit 3: yeah nevermind, I think I’m clearly NTA here, which I’m relieved about. Thank you everyone for taking time out to comment, I’m glad I was able to make some of you laugh
