Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

[Marvel / DC] How much do normal people know about magic?
We have Doctor Strange or Constantine, normal people who can use magic, so ...

How much do average people know about magic?

They do not know? Or do they know that it exists and where to learn it? Any in-between point?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Make it so that people are not aware of the magical community. This would keep people from trying to learn magic themselves and would keep magic users from being persecuted.
-Make it so that people who can use magic are not persecuted and are able to use their powers without fear of retribution.
-Provide resources and education to help magic users learn to use their powers for the good of humanity.
-Create a society in which magic users are able to use their powers to help those in need and are rewarded for their efforts.
