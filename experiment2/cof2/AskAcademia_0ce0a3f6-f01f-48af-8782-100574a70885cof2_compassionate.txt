Should I get a Letter of Recommendation from the Head of Department or an ex-Assistant Professor?
Hi everyone. I'm applying for Masters in Computer Science in US Universities for Fall 2022. I was wondering whether it would be a better idea to get a letter of recommendation from the head of my department under whom I have studied one subject or from an assistant professor who has since moved to another university under whom Iâ€™ve done significant projects and research, other than getting the highest marks in the class in his subject. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I should get it from the latter, would it be okay that he is not affiliated to my university anymore? And would I have to mention his old email address pertaining to our university or the new email address from his new university?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
- It sounds like you are feeling a lot of pressure around this decision! I want you to know that you can take your time and make the best choice for you.
- Both of those options sound like great choices! Why don't you take some time to think about what factors are most important to you and what will make you feel most successful?
- It sounds like you have a lot of great options! How can I help you to explore them further and make the best decision for you?
