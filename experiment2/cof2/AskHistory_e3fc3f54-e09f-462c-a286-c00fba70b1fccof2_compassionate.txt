Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What’s the best way to build a fairly complete overview of WWII?
I’m looking for documentaries/ books/ etc as I’m new to studying history and I realized I don’t know nearly as much about the non American pop culture side of things as I should. I’d prefer series/ movies/ books that accurately cover a broad overview of the what and why so I can then decide what specific events I want to focus on in more detail.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
- "Where do you want to start? I can help you get started with some good resources."
- "Let me know if you need any help finding anything."
- "Do you want to talk about it? I'm here to listen."
