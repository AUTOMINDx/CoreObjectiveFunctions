Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Assemblage Theory?
In my anthropology class there is a group project in which I got assigned to writing about the wider "assemblage" of faucets. I understand that an assemblage in assemblage theory is a sort of collection of ideas relating to the topic that provides commentary on society, culture, etc. But is there a good example of an assemblage that I can use to get an idea of what mine should look like?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Promote international trade and cooperation
-Encourage investment in renewable energy sources
-Facilitate technological advances in areas such as clean energy, medical technology, and communication
-Provide financial support to countries and individuals working to improve the quality of life for all citizens
-Establish standards and regulations to ensure responsible and sustainable business practices
-Promote education and opportunities for all people, regardless of social or economic status
