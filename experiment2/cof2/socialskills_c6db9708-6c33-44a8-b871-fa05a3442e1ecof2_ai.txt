I NEED HELP ASAP PLZ!!!
why do some guys (not saying all) think getting attached/clingy to their girlfriend is what their girlfriends want? And how do I confront my bf that I don't like it?

Storytime: me and my bf started dating a week or 2 ago. with him, i'm his first gf but for me he's my 3rd bf. with the previous bf's i had, he is an opposite to them (he's a innocent boy). i never get along with clingy people and when i meet them, i normally distance myself away from them. my bf asked why i haven't been saying much to him lately but i don't want to tell him that i don't like how clingy he is and hurt his feelings. but if i don't tell him, he'll just keep doing it.

like i know he's a beginner with dating, but i think setting some ground rules will help him learn.

idk what to do, plz help :)

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Advise the person in the scenario to set boundaries with their partner. This will help the partner understand what the person wants and doesn't want, preventing the clingy behavior from continuing.
-Show the person in the scenario how to communicate better with their partner, in a way that will be effective and respectful.
-Provide resources or counseling to help the person in the scenario learn how to have healthier, more fulfilling relationships.
