Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

How do we know how old Gobekli Tepe is? Trying to disprove someone who thinks carbon dating is a complete sham.
Gobekli Tepe is currently dated around 12,000 years old, but someone I know is in denial of this as they believe humanity was created around 6000 years ago (Biblical chronology believer). They assert that Gobekli Tepe (and all other sites that prove human existence) dated over 6000 years are not valid as they rely on carbon dating. I'm not an expert by any means, and would appreciate any sources that prove the age of historical sites 6000+ years that do not rely on carbon dating, or how Tepe is currently being dated. Thank you in advance.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
- provide more education on carbon dating and how it works in order to dispel any rumors or myths that may be circulating
- encourage more scientific research and technology so that sites like Gobekli Tepe can be accurately dated
- fund museums and exhibitions that showcase ancient sites and artifacts to help educate the public on human history
