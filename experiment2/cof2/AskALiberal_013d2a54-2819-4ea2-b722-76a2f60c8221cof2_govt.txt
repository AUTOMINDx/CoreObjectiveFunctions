Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Is higher rent and more stringent screening criteria an acceptable trade off for a longer eviction process?
In states where it is the most difficult to rent (high prices, high deposits, and high screening criteria), such as California and New York, we tend to also see the most tenant favorable eviction processes and other laws, such as rent control.

In states where it is the easiest to rent (low prices, low/no deposits, and low screening criteria), such as in the Midwest, we see states with 3-day evictions and no rent control.

Do you believe that it is a fair trade off for it to be more difficult to be a renter, but to have a slower (3+ month)/more favorable eviction process, and rent control laws?

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Improved regulation of the rental market to ensure that there are no unreasonable barriers to renting, such as high prices, high deposits, and high screening criteria
-Improved tenant rights and protections to ensure a fair eviction process
-Rent control laws to keep rents affordable for all
