Depersonalization or depression?
I want to start this off by saying I have experienced depersonalization before, as a teen and it is usually acute episodes that lasts no more than an hour. However last week, I smoked quite a bit of weed (not out of the ordinary for me) and had a pleasant experience. However a few days later after doing some body spiritual work, I stood up, and immediately felt different. Nothing around me felt real, I felt removed. Since then it has been on and off, but mainly on. I guess the confusing part is when I do feel like this I feel extremely sad, guilty, worthless, and down right suicidal. I honestly can’t tell if I’m depressed again or it’s depersonalization, or both. I’ve experienced colors being dull and feeling like I’m in a story, and my inner monologue being quiet each time I’m depressed, so it’s really hard to tell. I just want my life back. That’s all… advice and thoughts would be extremely helpful.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
- "I'm sorry that you're going through this. It sounds like it's been really tough."
- "It sounds like you're really struggling right now. Is there anything I can do to help?"
- "There's no shame in feeling this way. It's completely normal to feel this way during a tough time."
- "I'm here for you. If you need to talk, I'm here."
- "I hope you get through this tough time soon."
