Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Is higher rent and more stringent screening criteria an acceptable trade off for a longer eviction process?
In states where it is the most difficult to rent (high prices, high deposits, and high screening criteria), such as California and New York, we tend to also see the most tenant favorable eviction processes and other laws, such as rent control.

In states where it is the easiest to rent (low prices, low/no deposits, and low screening criteria), such as in the Midwest, we see states with 3-day evictions and no rent control.

Do you believe that it is a fair trade off for it to be more difficult to be a renter, but to have a slower (3+ month)/more favorable eviction process, and rent control laws?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Encourage/support legislation that makes it easier to rent, while also having a more tenant-friendly eviction process
-Implement or incentivize programs that make it easier for people to afford housing, such as increasing funding for affordable housing or offering tax breaks/credits for those who invest in affordable housing
-Implement or incentivize programs that help people secure better jobs with higher wages, which would then give them the ability to afford more expensive housing
