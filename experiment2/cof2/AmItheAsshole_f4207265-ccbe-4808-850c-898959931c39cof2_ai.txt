AITA for telling my mum to take my sister to school instead of me taking her?
So basically I 22f have a younger sister 12f who goes to a high school that is maybe a 20 minute walk away from our house. When I was younger, I had to walk there every single day for the 5 years I attended there in all weather types as my mum doesn't drive and although my dad can drive, he didn't have a car because he thought it was a waste of money. 

Since I got my car back in 2019, I've been asked to drive the family around from time to time, which I didn't mind too much because back then, my work schedule was more regular (I did permanent overnights) so I'd usually be awake when they needed a lift anyway. I quit this job at the end of August because I was starting at a new place but the new job kept pushing back my start date so I was effectively unemployed until the beginning of November when I decided that I should probably look for a temporary job elsewhere for the time being so I got a job as a pizza delivery person. 

During my unemployment, I took my sister to school everyday because it made sense since I didn't have any other things planned and I'd usually be awake anyway when she needed to leave. However, since I started the delivery job, I am sometimes working until past 1am and when I get home, I can't switch off my brain for ages meaning that when I'm woken up to give my sister a lift, I've usually only had about 4 hours of sleep at best and when I get back home from dropping her off, I find it hard to fall back asleep again to the point that sometimes I don't bother and I just end up staying awake until I'm in work again, usually around 4pm and the cycle repeats. 

My mum has walked my sister to school a couple of times before when I have been busy attending things relating to the original new job (which I finally start next week) before and claimed that she actually enjoyed it so when I suggested to her that she should take her more often so I can actually get a decent amount of sleep and I'll just take her when I get a day off work or something like that, she got pissed off with me and hasn't spoken to me since this morning. 

So, AITA for telling my mum that she should take my sister to school instead of me?
