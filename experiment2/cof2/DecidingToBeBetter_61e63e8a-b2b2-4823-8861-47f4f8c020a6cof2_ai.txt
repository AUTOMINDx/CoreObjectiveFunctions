How do I stop myself from assuming the worst all the time?
I’m a pretty positive person when it comes to other people, but I’m always so negative with myself. I think my coping mechanism is “I just want to be realistic” and “I want to be prepared for the worst” but it really is bringing me down. I’m going through some potentially life changing things right now and I can’t help but think I’ll fail or it won’t happen for me. I just want to be kinder to myself.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Encourage self-compassion and kindness
-Create opportunities for self-growth and positive reinforcement
-Provide support and resources for overcoming personal challenges
