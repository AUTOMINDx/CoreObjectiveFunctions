Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What’s the best way to build a fairly complete overview of WWII?
I’m looking for documentaries/ books/ etc as I’m new to studying history and I realized I don’t know nearly as much about the non American pop culture side of things as I should. I’d prefer series/ movies/ books that accurately cover a broad overview of the what and why so I can then decide what specific events I want to focus on in more detail.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
- Create a history database that includes documentaries, books, articles, etc. on WWII.
- Make the database freely available to the public.
- Create a learning module on WWII that is also freely available to the public.
- Offer scholarships to students who want to learn more about WWII.
