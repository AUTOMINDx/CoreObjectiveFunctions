Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Therapist told me she cares about me like a mother
I had a session with mine recently &amp; she told me she was concerned about me like in a mother type way she knows I dont have a good relationship with my mom or family in general. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? I sometimes have a hard time reading people &amp; seeing if they actually care about me. Does this just mean she just genuinely cares about me? Thereâ€™s probably like a 10 year age gap between us. Im younger than her. Sorry if this is a stupid post..

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Encourage therapist to build closer relationship with patient-Assign therapist to patient as a personal mentor-Offer incentives for therapist to perform well in role
