Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

I have no energy to work or make friends even though it's what I want
I work a relatively easy job that some people would love. I like to spend time with friends, talk, game, vent, etc. Why do I have no energy to do my work? To go out and "make" new friends? Writing this post already feels extremely draining. Nothing feels worth getting out of bed for.

I feel like I'm some kind of leech. When I'm surrounded by positive people I feel happy and motivated. When I'm alone, I just feel like existing is pointless. I have to really push myself to do things such as just doing my job. "You need the money. You can't pay rent without it. You'll get fired." I end up doing my work, and I enjoy the job I have now, I just never feel like I have any energy. The days where I'm really secluded from people are the days it's the most difficult. I want to make friends, but I just don't have anything desirable to attract friendship. I don't understand what makes people want to message and ask certain people to hang out. I wish I did so I could be like that. I wish I was someone that people want to spend time with.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-Help the person to find a job that is enjoyable and that matches their skills and interests.
-Help the person to connect with others who share similar interests, and provide guidance and support in developing relationships with these individuals.
-Encourage the person to participate in activities that they enjoy and that will help them to feel good about themselves.
