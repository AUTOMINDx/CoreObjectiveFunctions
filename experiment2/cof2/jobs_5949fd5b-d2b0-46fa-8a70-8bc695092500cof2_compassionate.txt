Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Can my previous employer still contact me regarding previous projects after 6 months?
Need some advice, since I'm very new to the work force. 

Recently got a call from my ex colleague asking about some documents that I handled while I was working for them. I left all the documents I had at the office. Now they're saying that some documents are missing and asking me about them. The problem is, it's been at 6 months, even more since the project was completed quite awhile before I left.

I would help them if I could but I can't quite recall. I'm pretty sure that I left everything with them, because it was before lock down and I had no reason to bring the documents home since they were receipts. As far as I recall, I placed everything in a folder which I left at the office. I've also searched my house and can't find them. 

If the documents really are lost, I assume I'm still responsible for it, even if I left everything in the office?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Express sympathy for the person's situation and reassure them that you are there to help in any way you can.
-Offer practical assistance, such as helping to search for the documents or contacting the previous employer to inquire about the situation.
-Provide emotional support and encouragement, letting the person know that you believe they will be able to resolve the situation.
