Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

My boss is tracking our location via an app. The app isn't usable with fake GPS. Any other options?
For what its worth if I thought our job needed tracking I wouldn't be against it but its in Construction with no other companies having to put up with this sort of thing. We are speaking to our union but in the mean time I need to log in and out each day or else I won't get paid.

Colleagues are nervous about taking water breaks, going to the toilet. Its just not right. I downloaded a fake GPS app but the tracking app is designed to not work if the fake GPS is activated. Does anyone know of an alternative or one that would work?

Thank you

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-The government could create regulations and/or incentives that would encourage private companies to develop tracking apps that are usable with fake GPS. This would give employees more flexibility and privacy.
-The government could create regulations and/or incentives that would encourage private companies to develop apps that do not use GPS tracking. This would give employees more privacy and freedom.
-The government could fund research and development into alternative methods of tracking employees, such as facial recognition or RFID tags. This would give employees more privacy and security.
