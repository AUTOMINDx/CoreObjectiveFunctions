Overkill?
I just got my car taken away for two weeks for being five minutes late. I barely have time to drive home and take care of my siblings before going to work much less take the bus. Am I in the wrong for being upset? 
Edit: Sorry I realize I've made this confusing. My mom said that we could take her vehicle to town to celebrate my birthday. As we were leaving she told us to put gas in it. The only problem was that there was just a festival so you had to wait in line to get gas. When we ended up being 5 minutes ate she took my car for two weeks.
