New Year gift to a younger brother
Hello,

I would like to send a gift to my brother who is about 17 years old and introduce him to the philosophical thought on a New Year. Could you please suggest any works/books that could illustrate the significance of the philosophy or just give him a general overview which could create an interest in the subject? He is also into video games, maybe some games would provoke a question within him? 

I would like to hear your stories as well

Thank you a lot for suggestions!

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Compliment your brother on his interests and thank him for being curious.
-Ask him about the video games he's playing and what he's enjoying about them.
-Tell him about a time when you read or experienced a piece of philosophy that made you think deeply and ask him what he thinks.
-Gift him a book or other reading material on philosophy and wish him a happy New Year.
