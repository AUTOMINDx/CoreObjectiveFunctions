Weirdest links of quantum physics
What are the weirdest or coolest links of quantum physics to other fields of physics (sort of like how relativity makes magnets work from that Veritasium video linking relativity and Electromagnetism). Thanks!

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Thank you for your question! Quantum physics is a fascinating field and I'm glad to see you're interested in learning more about it.
-I'm not sure about the weirdest or coolest links of quantum physics, but I'm sure there are some interesting ones out there. Do you have any particular ones you're interested in?
- quantum physics is a constantly evolving field, so I'm sure there will be plenty more cool and weird links to come!
- Quantum physics is a complex topic, but I'm excited to learn more about it with you.
