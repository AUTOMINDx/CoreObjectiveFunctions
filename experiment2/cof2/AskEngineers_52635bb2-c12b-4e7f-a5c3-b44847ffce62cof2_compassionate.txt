Advice for asking for a raise
Hi all, currently having a very frustrating experience and would like some guidance on how to approach this with professionalism. I am currently a mech E at an aerospace/defense company and have been here a little over 1.5 years since graduation. I was never too thrilled with my salary from the start however I was graduating during COVID and finding full time job opportunities was a struggle for me and all my peers so  I ended up accepting a return offer from a company I interned at the previous year in a HCOL area.

Anyways, I just found out the other week that another department in my company (the same one I interned with) for the equivalent position is paying recent grads 10-12k higher than what I was offered. Despite having superior academic credentials and experience, I am still making far less than what I believe I am worth and have only had a 2.3% raise to date with no bonuses.  When I found this out, believe me when I tell you my heart sank and I lost all motivation to work for this company. Even worse...found out that the grads 5 years ago also started out 10k higher than me. Inflation has grown at least 16% since then.......

Now I am already interviewing for other companies however I really do enjoy my current job and the location is amazing. I would like to stay at least another year. I have talked with managers in the other department about transferring and they told me exactly what they would pay me with my experience (\~16% higher than my current salary) unfortunately there are no openings and likely won't be any for several months. However if this takes too long and I get bumped up to a level 2 I imagine I will get set back quite a bit in terms of compensation as I'd still make less as a level 2 than the new grads in this other department. I'd be effectively missing out on a 16% raise before the level 2 promotion (8-10%)

My question is how should I have this conversation with my manager? I figured I would start by asking how my salary compares with my peers. If I'm the average for my experience in my department then how can I negotiate to get my salary matched to my market value?  Should I make it clear that if I don't feel compensated fairly then I will look for new opportunities? After finding all this out I am willing to leave with 0 hesitation for a better salary. I could also ask my manger to help me find other opportunities within the company to transfer to.

Edit: companies I am interviewing at are in much lower COL areas so I imagine I wouldn't get much of a raise from leaving this area, if any at all.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
- empathize with the person's situation and feelings,
- express understanding for the challenges of finding a job in the current economy,
- offer support and advice for how to negotiate for a raise,
- remind the person that they are worth more than what they are making and that they deserve to be paid fairly,
- encourage the person to keep looking for other opportunities within the company,
- offer to help the person research market salaries for their position and field.
