What made you realize you’ve outgrown your friends, and was the “breakups” ugly or cordial?

25 years old and Been really self improving the last year in a half. Lost 90 pounds and have been working out consistently for 1yr+, changed my career goals, going back to school as well as managing 2 side hustles. 

My friends don’t seem to understand me anymore and they think I’m just money driven, maybe that’s the case tbh but I don’t think it’s bad that I want more for myself. 

I don’t really care about the same things as before that we had in common. And they kind of spend the majority of their time talking negatively about mutual people, and it’s tiring and a waste of time to be around to be honest. 

What’s your guys experiences?
