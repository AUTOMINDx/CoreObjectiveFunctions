Is there somebody in a similar situation? I have met people with horrible parents as well but they still have friendships. I don't know I have made something wrong...Nmom sabotaged all my childhood friendships and relationships with other family members my age like cousins that were really close. I had a lot of friendships as a child that ended out of the blue and now I see it was her sabotaging them. And as an adult, I have entered a lot of toxic environments where people tend to be not emotionally available.
