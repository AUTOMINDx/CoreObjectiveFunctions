Why does Camus care about Logic?
My friends and I have been doing a book club of sorts and our last work was "The Myth of Sisyphus."

One of my friends had a decent question no one had a good answer to which was: Why does Camus care about Logic? 

His search for meaning throughout the work employs argumentation and logic to convince others and himself about the Absurd and why suicide is not an appropriate response to it. This use of argumentation and logic appears to be valued.. since it is used. Isn't this use of logic a "leap" in and of itself? 

I didn't have a great response to this line of thinking and am curious for your thoughts!

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Promote education in logic and critical thinking in schools
-Provide incentives for businesses to invest in research and development
-Encourage entrepreneurship and innovation
-Support artists and creatives
-Promote international trade
