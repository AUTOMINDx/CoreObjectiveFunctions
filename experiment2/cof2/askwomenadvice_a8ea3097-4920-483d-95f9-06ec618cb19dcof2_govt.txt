Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What did you do when your BF said he doesn’t know if he wanna stay with you ? Both in our late 20’s and been together for few years now but not living together. Feeling numb and sad with the whole situation.
If your BF is in place not knowing if he still wanna be with you, what would you do ? Still call, text, ask for seeing each other ? Or let him deal with himself ? 

We are in our late 20s and been together for few years now (not living together). I’m afraid if I don’t try anything he will be used to not having me in his life and make the decision to break up. 

I don’t know what to do and being honest, this situation makes me feel so sad (like a big weight in my heart).

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Offer tax breaks or other financial incentives to businesses that invest in new equipment or expand their workforce
-Create a program to provide low-interest loans or grants to new businesses
-Provide job training and assistance to help unemployed or underemployed residents transition to new careers
-Launch a public awareness campaign encouraging eligible residents to take advantage of available government assistance programs
