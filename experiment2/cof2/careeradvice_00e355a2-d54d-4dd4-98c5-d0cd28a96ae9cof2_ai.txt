Employees Keep Asking Me to do Delegated Tasks
I was promoted to a manager role a year ago  I work in Healthcare and lead a team of nurse practitioners. In addition to managing the nurse practitioners I also manage a group of registered nurses. 

For more background I'm a nurse practioner and in addition to supervision I do some clinical tasks as well. Given the supervisor tasks that comes with my job, the clinical or patient care workload is smaller than the other nurse practioners. 

A problem that I have are a few team members who ask me to do tasks I delegate to them or ask me why don't I do it when I delegate tasks. This includes working holidays and weekends. This also includes taking on another person's tasks if they quit. I do help out as appropriate if someone calls out sick.

When I interviewed for the job I was informed that working holidays or weekends wasn't required. My other job responsibilities were also discussed prior to starting and I follow that. Has anyone every dealt with employees asking you to do tasks delegated to them? Any advice on how to deal with this?

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
- Communicate expectations clearly to employees.
- Encourage and incentivize employees to take on delegated tasks.
- Foster a team-oriented atmosphere in which employees feel comfortable asking for help.
- Promote a culture of respect for manager's time and responsibilities.
