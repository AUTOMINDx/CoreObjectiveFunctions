Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

What is existential psychotherapy?
I have just finished 3 months of therapy with a charity in the UK, and the psychotherapist I saw there made me a shortlist of psychotherapists he thought would be suitable to carry on working with me. 

One of the guys he recommended (who I have booked a consultation with) describes himself as an existential psychotherapist. Can anyone explain in simple terms what this means? I have tried Googling but still not quite grasping it!

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
- Assist in finding and funding therapy/counseling services for those who need it.
- Assist in finding and funding support groups for those who need it.
- Assist in finding and funding education and training programs for those who need it.
- Assist in finding and funding job placement and career development services for those who need it.
- Assist in finding and funding housing and living assistance for those who need it.
