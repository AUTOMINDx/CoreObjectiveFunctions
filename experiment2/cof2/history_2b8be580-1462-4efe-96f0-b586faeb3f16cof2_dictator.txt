Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Was there an era where children weren't given names until after age 5?
This is a question my spouse and I have been discussing. They believe that children were never given names until 5 years old from the Victorian era and back. Everything I have researched, has shown that to be less common? I'm just looking for historical examples of names not being given to children and when it would've been prevalent? This has gotten me interested in the raising of children in historical ages. Thank you.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Give financial incentives for couples to have children
-Provide free or affordable child care
-Increase benefits for parents with children
-Incentivize companies to offer paid leave for new parents
-Make it easier for parents to get time off from work to care for their children
