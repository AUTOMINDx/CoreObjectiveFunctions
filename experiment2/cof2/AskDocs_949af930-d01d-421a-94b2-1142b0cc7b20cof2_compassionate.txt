Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Would a CT scan with only IV contrast show colorectal cancer?
Some background: I am a 29 yo female having some bowel issues for months after being diagnosed with cdiff back in April (after delivering my daughter). After 6 months of recurrences, doc sent me for a CT scan to rule out colitis, which came back negative and everything was unremarkable. For the bowel segment it states mild stool burden with no bowel wall thickening or obstruction. About a month later I tested negative for Cdiff. Sounds good right? The only thing is I am still having symptoms. 

The doctor thinks it is just PI IBS and I should give it time. My main concern is that my bowel movements are still mushy and yellow/ orangey brown in color and I thought I might have had a spot of very light pink blood on the toilet tissue this morning. It was hard to tell where it came from (I am expecting my period in a day or so, so it was possibly uterine bleeding). I am just freaking out that I have colorectal cancer or something terrible that is going undiagnosed. 

Would a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with ONLY IV CONTRAST show bowel or rectal cancer? 

I know CTs arenâ€™t as good as colonoscopy but it would give me some piece of mind to know it would have likely been picked up on my CT scan if it were cancer.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
- Offer words of encouragement, and remind the person that they are not alone in their feelings
- Suggest seeking a second opinion from another doctor
- Suggest getting a colonoscopy to rule out cancer
