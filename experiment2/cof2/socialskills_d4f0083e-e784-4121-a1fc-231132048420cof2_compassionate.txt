Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

How do I adjust my speech tone and talk much fluently.
I canâ€™t speak with a solid tone, it appears to me that I have held on multiple tones and speech styles throughout my childhood, and I currently keep switching between them as I speak with people, which does put me in a very weak position and a major disadvantage when it comes to making friends and being social.

I also keep crashing especially when there are much thoughts going around and the conversation is fast-paced.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Say that you understand how they feel and offer words of encouragement.
-Suggest they see a speech therapist to help with their pronunciation and fluency.
-If they are comfortable with it, suggest they record themselves speaking so they can listen to how they sound and work on correcting any errors.
