Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Careers that utilize creativity and business?
Hey everybody, I just started working 3 months ago as an implementation consultant. I find the work very boring and apparently my company has very high turnover due to workload stress and general boredom. I produce music in my free time, design in powerpoint, make clothing designs, etc. I also enjoyed doing strategy consulting in college and giving presentations, basically doing some sort of business strategy work. I enjoy working in small groups and have no issues talking to people. I hate programming and coding which is still a surprise to myself seeing as I produce music, but coding in Java and Javascript is something I never enjoyed and frustrated me. 

I've read that UI and UX roles are up my alley and I've been doing some networking, unfortunately I don't really have the portfolio necessary for those jobs. Anybody have any other suggestions?

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Encourage and incentivize creativity and innovation in the workforce
-promote business and economic growth
-support job training and professional development that encourages creativity and innovation
-develop initiatives that support small businesses
