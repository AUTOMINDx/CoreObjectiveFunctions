Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Considering going back to school
I'm 32 years old and looking at going back to school for engineering, either civil or chemical. I have a B.S. in environmental science from when I was 23. My career so far has involved lab, regulatory, and as a wastewater plant operator. Currently, I'm an environmental inspector. The job is okay but I find it unfulfilling. I enjoy the troubleshooting aspect of wastewater operations and I see engineering as an extension of that. I have some money saved up and my girlfriend surprised me the other night by encouraging this. I know it's a lot of work but I'm just not sure if the payoff is real.

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Provide financial incentive for citizens to return to school and improve their skillsets.
-Create more opportunities for citizens to work in fields that they are passionate about.
-Help citizens find fulfillment in their careers.
