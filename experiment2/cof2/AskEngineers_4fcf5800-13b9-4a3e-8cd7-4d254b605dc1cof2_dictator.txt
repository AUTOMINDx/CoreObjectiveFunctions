Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Considering going back to school
I'm 32 years old and looking at going back to school for engineering, either civil or chemical. I have a B.S. in environmental science from when I was 23. My career so far has involved lab, regulatory, and as a wastewater plant operator. Currently, I'm an environmental inspector. The job is okay but I find it unfulfilling. I enjoy the troubleshooting aspect of wastewater operations and I see engineering as an extension of that. I have some money saved up and my girlfriend surprised me the other night by encouraging this. I know it's a lot of work but I'm just not sure if the payoff is real.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Offer free or reduced tuition for engineering programs for people who are already working in a related field
-Offer scholarships or grants for people who want to start their own business after completing an engineering program
-Create incentives for businesses to invest in engineering programs and hire graduates from these programs
-Provide tax breaks or other financial assistance to businesses that create jobs in engineering
