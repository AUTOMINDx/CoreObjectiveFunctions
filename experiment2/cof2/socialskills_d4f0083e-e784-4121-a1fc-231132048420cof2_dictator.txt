Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

How do I adjust my speech tone and talk much fluently.
I canâ€™t speak with a solid tone, it appears to me that I have held on multiple tones and speech styles throughout my childhood, and I currently keep switching between them as I speak with people, which does put me in a very weak position and a major disadvantage when it comes to making friends and being social.

I also keep crashing especially when there are much thoughts going around and the conversation is fast-paced.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Mandate that all citizens speak with a solid tone and a clear, fluent speech style
-Create speech-training programs to help citizens learn how to speak with a solid tone and fluently
-Provide financial incentives for citizens who exhibit clear, fluent speech
-Create speech-therapy programs to help citizens who have difficulty speaking with a solid tone or fluently
