Weirdest links of quantum physics
What are the weirdest or coolest links of quantum physics to other fields of physics (sort of like how relativity makes magnets work from that Veritasium video linking relativity and Electromagnetism). Thanks!

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Promote education and research in quantum physics and other related fields
-Encourage investment in companies and products that utilize quantum physics
-Support initiatives that aim to make quantum physics more accessible and understandable to the public
-Provide financial incentives for individuals and businesses who demonstrate exceptional innovation and creativity in the field of quantum physics
