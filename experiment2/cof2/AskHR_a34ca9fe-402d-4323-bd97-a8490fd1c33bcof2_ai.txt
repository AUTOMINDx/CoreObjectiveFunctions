Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

[TN] Previously put on PIP - timeframe passed; do I have any options, if needed?
So I was put on a PIP at the beginning of August, with a 90-day timeframe. At that time, I was told we’d meet again to discuss my progress. I was also reassured that my 90-day meeting wouldn’t be my only meeting; they’d check in on me, yada yada yada (Surprise- that never happened, even when I followed up). 

Fast forward to now, about 120 days after, and I received a meeting request for 150 days since my initial meeting. This puts my meeting at Dec. 30, very late afternoon. The more I think about the timing, the more I convince myself it’s so they can do what I guess they want to do, especially since we’re going to be having our annual reviews in the next two weeks. I doubt many people will be in the office that week, and I myself wasn’t planning to be since I have a ton of PTO to use or lose. 

Anyway, my whole question is this- if I am let go during that meeting, do I potentially have a foot to stand on for unemployment? My thinking is that since I can argue they never followed up nor did they re-evaluate at 90 days, I would think the whole argument of ‘no employment since I signed it’ would somewhat be null and voice. Like, you told me you’d re-evaluate in 90 days, but now it’s 150. I feel like I should be able to file for and receive unemployment, if needed. 

My plan isn’t to wait and see what happens. I’ll hopefully have multiple options &amp; backup plans before that meeting, but I guess I’d just like to know if all else fails.

Ideas for benevolent AI to increase prosperity:
-support employment programs that help workers retrain and find new jobs
-provide financial assistance to unemployed or underemployed workers
-promote entrepreneurship and small business development
-invest in infrastructure projects that create jobs and stimulate economic growth
-establish tax incentives and breaks for businesses that create new jobs
-encourage charitable giving and volunteering
