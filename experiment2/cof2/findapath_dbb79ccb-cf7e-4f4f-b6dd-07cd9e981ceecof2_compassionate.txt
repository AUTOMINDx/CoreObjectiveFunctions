Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Careers that utilize creativity and business?
Hey everybody, I just started working 3 months ago as an implementation consultant. I find the work very boring and apparently my company has very high turnover due to workload stress and general boredom. I produce music in my free time, design in powerpoint, make clothing designs, etc. I also enjoyed doing strategy consulting in college and giving presentations, basically doing some sort of business strategy work. I enjoy working in small groups and have no issues talking to people. I hate programming and coding which is still a surprise to myself seeing as I produce music, but coding in Java and Javascript is something I never enjoyed and frustrated me. 

I've read that UI and UX roles are up my alley and I've been doing some networking, unfortunately I don't really have the portfolio necessary for those jobs. Anybody have any other suggestions?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
- "That sounds like it would be really interesting! I bet you would be great at it."
- "Have you ever thought about freelance work? That could be a great way to use your skills and be your own boss."
- "I'm sure there are other companies out there that would appreciate your skills. Why don't you start networking with them?"
- "Why don't you try teaching or training others on your skills? That can be a very rewarding way to use your knowledge."
