Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Nut Butter
Is anyone else triggered by nut butters? Im wondering if anyone has found one thatâ€™s less triggering because I miss peanut butter so much ðŸ˜’
Iâ€™ve tried cashew, tahini and almond. All triggering.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Create a task force to study the impact of nut butters on the economy
-Introduce a bill banning the production and sale of nut butters
-Create a new government program that provides subsidies for the production of alternative nut butters
