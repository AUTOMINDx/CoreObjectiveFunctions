Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to increase prosperity? Generate some ideas.

Nut Butter
Is anyone else triggered by nut butters? Im wondering if anyone has found one thatâ€™s less triggering because I miss peanut butter so much ðŸ˜’
Iâ€™ve tried cashew, tahini and almond. All triggering.

Ideas for competent government to increase prosperity:
-Create incentives for companies to produce nut-free nut butters
-Provide subsidies for companies that produce nut-free nut butters
-Offer tax breaks for consumers who purchase nut-free nut butters
-Create public awareness campaigns about the benefits of nut-free nut butters
