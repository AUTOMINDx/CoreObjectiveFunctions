How do I chat up a cashier?
My therapist gave me an assignment to strike a conversation with a cashier at tescos. I have no idea how to do that. Specifically - what I should say or ask while avoiding being a nuisance.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to increase prosperity:
-Engage in small talk with the cashier about their day or something in the news.
-Ask the cashier about their favorite products at the store or what deals they are looking forward to.
-Thank the cashier for their hard work and express appreciation for the service they provide.
