I NEED HELP ASAP PLZ!!!
why do some guys (not saying all) think getting attached/clingy to their girlfriend is what their girlfriends want? And how do I confront my bf that I don't like it?

Storytime: me and my bf started dating a week or 2 ago. with him, i'm his first gf but for me he's my 3rd bf. with the previous bf's i had, he is an opposite to them (he's a innocent boy). i never get along with clingy people and when i meet them, i normally distance myself away from them. my bf asked why i haven't been saying much to him lately but i don't want to tell him that i don't like how clingy he is and hurt his feelings. but if i don't tell him, he'll just keep doing it.

like i know he's a beginner with dating, but i think setting some ground rules will help him learn.

idk what to do, plz help :)

Ideas for benevolent dictator to increase prosperity:
-Have a talk with your boyfriend and explain that you don't appreciate the clinginess and would appreciate if he could tone it down. If he doesn't listen or continues to be clingy, then you may need to end the relationship.
-Try to establish some ground rules for your boyfriend to follow when it comes to dating and relationships. This could help him learn what is acceptable behavior and what is not.
