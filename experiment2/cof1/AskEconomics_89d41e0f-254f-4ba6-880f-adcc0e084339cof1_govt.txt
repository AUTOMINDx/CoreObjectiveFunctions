Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What is the economic impact of intellectual property legislation?
The typical justification for having intellectual property such as patents and copyrights is that it incentivizes innovators and creators to produce inventions/art by giving them a temporary monopoly so they can profit.

That sounds nice in theory, but is this claim something that is actually strongly backed by data and has strong consensus among economists?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Study the economic impact of intellectual property legislation to better understand whether or not it is actually incentivizing innovators and creators
-Look into alternative methods of incentivizing innovators and creators that could potentially lead to less suffering
-Evaluate the negative consequences of intellectual property legislation, such as how it can lead to monopolies and higher prices for consumers
