I am FUMING. Especially after reading that bullshit '90%+' quote. Tempted to go off in the comments...


Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Competent government could provide accurate information about the situation, both to the public and to aid organizations. This would help to reduce the amount of inaccurate information and rumor that circulates, which can lead to further panic and suffering.
-Competent government could work with other countries and organizations to provide aid and relief to those affected. This would help to provide much-needed assistance to those who are suffering.
-Competent government could coordinate and provide resources to help people evacuate or shelter in place. This would help to ensure that people are safe and can get the help they need.
