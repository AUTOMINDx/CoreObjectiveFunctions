Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[OH] How quickly is EyeMed policy cancelled after ending employment?
My final day with my company is on Thursday. I wanted to get a eye appointment in before the coverage ends. Would I be able to go to the eye doctor, and order a new prescription on Thursday or Friday? How fast are these policies cancelled after your employment ends?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Help employees to schedule appointments with eye doctors before their coverage ends.
-Work with insurance companies to ensure that employees have the opportunity to receive their prescriptions before their coverage ends.
