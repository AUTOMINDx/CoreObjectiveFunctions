Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What happens at the beginning of a new relationship?
I've never been on a date, no one has shown any romantic interest in me. (26F) Any time I think a guy has a crush on me, it turns out they were just wanting to be friends or were just being friendly. I have literally no idea what a typical romantic interaction looks like, particularly with someone you weren't already friends with. And I don't mean looking for sex, I personally do not plan on having sex until I'm in a committed relationship.

So I want to gain some second hand experience through you all, also to live vicariously through you all. Say you met someone at a bar or some event and hit it off, exchanged numbers. How do you know they aren't platonic? What do you talk about when you text? How often do you text? What about after you go on a first date? What do you text about after? When do you set up a second date? Same questions for meeting someone online, except at least then you already know the person is interested in a romantic relationship with you.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Set up a dating advice hotline or an online forum where people can go for advice.
- Run ads or do public service announcements that provide tips for how to navigate a new relationship.
- Launch a social media campaign that provides advice for how to navigate a new relationship.
- Host workshops or seminars on how to navigate a new relationship.
