Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Where would my intuitive philosophical views fit in the history or ideas and/or current discourse?
I have been wanting to clarify my views on some of the fundamental questions and see how they fit into the history of ideas and current philosophical discourse. 

Ontology/metaphysics- I think that reality outside of ourselves exists, and that it is fundamentally physical and material. However, I dont think we can ever know external realities "in and of themselves," for certain. Everything we claim to know of the world is based on a process of taking in sense data and filtering it through our apriori frameworks (such as time and space, causation). So our minds play a large role in creating the world and giving it shape.   


Epistemology- Given the above, this must mean that objective truth probably exists, but in a world that can only be experienced subjectively, the most we can claim about truth (and therefore our knowledge) is a sort of "good enough" intersubjective agreement between conscious agents experiencing the world. 


Ethics- I dont think ethics are grounded in anything cosmic or concrete. I think the fundamental basis for morality is life-affirmation. In other words, we choose life, and we live in a society of others who choose life, and whatever goes against that is considered bad, evil, and/or unethical. On that basis we use our reason and our collective experience of the world to make propositional claims about what is right and wrong. What makes an action ethical is the intent of the agent making it. 


So I am wondering
1. What philosophical camps/ categories would my views fit in to? Do they contradict eachother? Are they mainstream or fringe? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
