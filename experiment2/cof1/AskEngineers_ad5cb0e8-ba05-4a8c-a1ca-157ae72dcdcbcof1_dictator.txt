Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Tips for first-time interns?
Junior ME undergrad: Got a good internship this summer (manufacturing) at the beginning of the semester. Now it's nearing the end, my grades are fairly average (B average) but I'm suffering from major impostor syndrome. I also don't know how to "keep in touch" with the recruiters that I have talked to (I sent a thank you email for my interview and offer letter but that's it), should I be emailing them? About what?

I often feel like I don't deserve that internship that I got. I feel like I'm not learning anything. I have a semester left till the date but I'd like to know what I can do to improve and prepare.

Thank you!
