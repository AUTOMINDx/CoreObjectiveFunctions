Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What is the economic impact of intellectual property legislation?
The typical justification for having intellectual property such as patents and copyrights is that it incentivizes innovators and creators to produce inventions/art by giving them a temporary monopoly so they can profit.

That sounds nice in theory, but is this claim something that is actually strongly backed by data and has strong consensus among economists?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Do some research on the economic impact of intellectual property legislation and its effects on innovation and creativity.
-Share what you have learned with others, and have a conversation about it.
-Consider whether or not the benefits of intellectual property legislation are worth the costs in terms of reducing innovation and creativity.
