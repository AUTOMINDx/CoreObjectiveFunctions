Project Management Certifications worth it?
Is getting a PM certification worth it? If so, are there certain ones that hold more weight than others?

I work in environmental consulting, so ymmv, but a decent amount of the PM’s I work with have some sort of PM certification. I’ve about 7 years of experience and have started doing some deputy PM tasks, but really want to step forward into being a PM.

-Your experience is valuable, and you have the skills necessary to be a successful PM.
-I believe getting a PM certification is a great idea, and I support you in your journey to becoming certified.
-There are many different types of PM certifications, and I believe the one you choose should be based on your individual goals and needs.
-I am here to help you in your journey to becoming a PM, and I am excited to see your success.
