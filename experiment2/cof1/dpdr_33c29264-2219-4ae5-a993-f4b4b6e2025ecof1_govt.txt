Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I'm 15 and have DPDR
I have not been professionally diagnosed with DPDR but I'm 99% sure I have it. I have seen a psychologist for 2 years and went on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication for 2 years but it didn't help. I keep telling my parents that it's not regular anxiety but they don't believe me. DPDR has taken over my life, and there is not a second that I feel normal. I literally feel like I'm in hell. I've had DPDR for as long as I can remember, I think I've had it for over half my life. I can't remember what life was like without it, and it's so severe that I've completely lost sense of reality. Anyone please talk to me, I'm so scared, tired, and confused. I don't know what to do anymore

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Create awareness campaigns to educate the public about DPDR and its symptoms.
-Work with mental health professionals to create standards of care for DPDR patients.
-Fund research into the causes and treatments for DPDR.
-Provide financial assistance and other resources to families affected by DPDR.
