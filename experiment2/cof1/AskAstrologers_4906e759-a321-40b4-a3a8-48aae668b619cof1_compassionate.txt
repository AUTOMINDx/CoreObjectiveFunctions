-It sounds like you're really struggling right now. Can I do anything to help make things a little easier for you?
-I'm sorry you're feeling so lost and uncertain. I know that can be really tough. Can I talk to you about it? I'd love to offer any support that I can.
-I know it's tough when we don't know what we want to do with our lives. I've been there before too. Are you interested in talking about it more, or do you want me to leave you alone for a bit?
