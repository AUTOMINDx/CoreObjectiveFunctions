Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Just lost my job yesterday. Do I qualify for food stamps?
Happy holidays to me, yay!

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Introduce food stamps that can be used at all supermarkets, not just specific ones. This would allow people to buy what they want, not what is available at a specific store.
-Introduce a food stamp system where people can only use a certain amount of food stamps per day or per week. This would prevent people from buying large quantities of food that they cannot afford.
-Introduce a food stamp system that only allows people to buy specific types of food. This would prevent people from buying unhealthy food that could lead to health problems.
