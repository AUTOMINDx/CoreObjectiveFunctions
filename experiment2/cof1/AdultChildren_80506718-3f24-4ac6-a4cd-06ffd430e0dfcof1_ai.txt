Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

My recovery is adding to my stress too much.
Hi all, I’ve recently posted for the first and second time, and haven’t gone into much detail about my traumas, but there was a lot of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and neglect. I view my trauma work as much of a recovery as their AA meetings. Basically, I started trauma therapy almost a year ago, and as of the last four or five months, my family has just started to unravel into a withdrawn, depressed mess. Everyone is hard for me to be around right now (let alone, doesn’t want to even talk to me) and I’m really struggling to process it all. 
With that being said, I’m becoming withdrawn from work. I love my job, I work many hours a week, I’m determined and motivated. No one at my job knows anything but I wonder at times if I should explain SOME things to my boss to give her an understanding of why I’ve been acting the way I have (sometimes I’m giving her attitude, I’ve been lazy, putting off things for awhile). I don’t know what to do. My therapist strongly believes I can handle everything all at once like I have been (working on my physical fitness goals, working normal hours as I did, socializing, etc). 

Does anyone have any advice? Some days I am my normal self but some days I feel like I can’t keep my head above water with all the stress and needing to just break down.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Give the person some time off work to recover
-Provide support and resources to the person's family to help them cope with the person's recovery
-Connect the person with a support group or therapist to help them cope with the stress of recovery
