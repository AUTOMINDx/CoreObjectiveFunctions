Do you try to sabotage your healthy romantic relationship(s)?
I am in a happy relationship, and have a very supportive partner. I often find it difficult to accept that they do love me, and worry about things going wrong, which in turn makes me want to sabotage my relationship. I have intrusive thoughts sometimes about, how I could hurt them before or in case they hurt me, etc. Do other sufferers of PTSD also experience this? I donâ€™t understand why I sometimes want to push away a wonderful thing.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-If the AI recognizes that the individual is in a healthy and supportive relationship, it could provide positive reinforcement to help the individual feel more secure in the relationship.
-If the AI recognizes that the individual is experiencing intrusive thoughts about harming their partner, it could provide positive reinforcement to help the individual replace these thoughts with more positive ones.
