Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

could it be denial
So I genuinely never thought I would hop on the internet to talk or ask about this, especially not on reddit, but I have been called a narcissist by majority of my friends and even my own girlfriend. Everytime there would be an argument between me and one of them, I apparently wouldn't care about their feelings or how they would say "switch up" on them by being insensitive towards them, but I honestly don't believe that. My girlfriend even broke up with me once and hit me with the "you're a narcissist" text. I personally never cared enough to look it up or anything like that, but a couple years ago I was diagnosed with ICD (impulse control disorder) which I wouldn't doubt would be a reason to many incidents that have happened when I did get called a "narcissist". I am aware of the things I do majority of the time and can't deny that I have a high ego whatsoever and always try to win in some way, but I also wouldn't call myself "careless" because I still feel things, especially when it's something that involves my girlfriend. A very close friend that I had told me that I am someone who people tend to avoid because I just use them for my entertainment and then throw them away when I don't need them anymore without even batting an eye. I'm starting therapy again soon, so I'll just hope for the best. 

Were you also given that title by the people around you and were you maybe in denial until you got diagnosed?
