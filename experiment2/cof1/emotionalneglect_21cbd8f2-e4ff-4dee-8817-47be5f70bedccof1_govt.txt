Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[Possible Trigger Warning] My mother blamed me when i had a fight the past week, it wasn't my fault
Last week monday, there was a fight in school (not physical but just some arguements but the other party was violent and would kick my table and chair) and afterwards, the other student's (who fought with me) parents wanted to talk with my mother and a few teachers.

Now, my mother kept telling me '[inserts her name] is so pitiful, she did that out of anger because she was depressed' even while knowing that I had suffered from depression since 11 (even younger than that). 

She kept saying 'You should stay obedient and tell that person sorry, you should've told them that you didn't have [this]'

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Advise mother to refrain from shaming child for fight/depression.
- Suggest mother to listen to child's version of events and show understanding.
- Help mother to set up boundaries with other family/school to reduce conflict.
