Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Working with big egos and broken sensitivity
What are the behaviours that you would recommend while working as a team of seniors (7 to 40 years of experience more than you) who have inflated egos and has a complete lack of sensitivity and do not respect your personal deadlines in the interest of the projects (job applications, work permit deadlines)? You also don't have any other choice to select a different team.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-I'm sorry that you're feeling frustrated. Is there anything I can do to help?
-I can understand how that might be frustrating for you.
-Is there anything I can do to help you get your work done on time?
-I'm sorry that you feel like you're being ignored.
-Is there anything I can do to help you feel more included?
-Thank you for taking the time to share your opinion.
