Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Am I weird for wearing a condom even with my partner ?
I'm 21 and in a relationship of 3 years. And whenever we do it I put a condom on no question asked because I do not want a kid . However my mates who are single refuse to wear one when they are on a one night stand and see it as completely normal. For me it's just absolutely crazy to even think that's safe.
I really am hoping that this isn't the norm.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Public campaigns about the importance of using condoms, even in long-term relationships
-Making condoms more widely available and affordable
-Providing free or low-cost contraception to those who need it
-Offering sex education in schools that includes information about safe sex practices
