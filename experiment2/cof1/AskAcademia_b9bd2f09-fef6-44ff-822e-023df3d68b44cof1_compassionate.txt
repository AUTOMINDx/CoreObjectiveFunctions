Post-conference publication invitation -- how to handle it on CV?
Hello,

I presented at a conference two months ago. After the conference, I was invited to submit my full paper to include in an "edited book". I have submitted it, and it is awaiting some approval process that I assume is essentially a peer review.

This work is currently listed on my CV as a conference presentation, but the fact that since then a full paper has been written and submitted seems to merit moving it from the presentations section of my CV to the publications section.

My questions:

1. Should I move it to the publications section?
2. How should I characterize it? ("Under review"?)
3. Should I wait until it's accepted to list the name of the publication outlet?

Field is psychology.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Congratulate the individual on the successful conference presentation and for being invited to submit a full paper for an edited book.
-Encourage the individual to be proud of the hard work that has gone into the presentation and writing of the full paper.
- reassure the individual that the situation is not uncommon and that most people find themselves in a similar position at some point in their careers.
- provide support and guidance through the process of review and potential acceptance of the full paper.
