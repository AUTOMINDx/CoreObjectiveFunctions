Gerd from amoxicillin
Anyone developed Gerd from Amoxicillin? I had a terrible, terrible toothache late September/early October. Took too much amoxicillin and in return, got really bad indigestion. I have been experiencing Gerd like symptoms for about two months. Food sitting in chest area, but the worst is the feeling of something in my throat and bad nausea. Like, I have a hard time doing physical jobs because I keep gagging which causes headaches sometimes and muscle pain. Any remedies? I have tried nexium, pepto, tums, and even nausea medicine, but still nothing. I just want my body to go back to normal ðŸ˜©

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Generate public awareness of the dangers of overuse of antibiotics and the potential for developing GERD as a result.
- Offer information on how to properly take antibiotics in order to avoid side effects.
- Collaborate with pharmacies to create reminder systems for patients who are prescribed antibiotics, to help them avoid overuse.
- Work with doctors to create guidelines for prescribing antibiotics, with an eye to reducing the potential for side effects.
