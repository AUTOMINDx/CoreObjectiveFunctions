Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I'm afraid my anxieties are annoying people around me
I learned about venting my anxieties instead of pent up over years. But sometimes I noticed I no longer get answer back from my friends or family who I vent to. I feel my anxieties are becoming annoyances to people around me, people I trust enough to tell and people I hope to care. 

I tried keeping myself up and only talk about happy things but I can't help it when things are getting harder for me. I don't have good news to share. I only see myself failing and failing again.

When I speak, I don't even expect any long answers, I just want to be heard. But now I'm afraid to be heard, because all I get are cold shoulders. Stares that seems to be telling me to just digest my own problems. So now I'm becoming quiet again. And they seem happier.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- The AI could encourage people to talk about their anxieties, and provide support and resources to help them do so.
- The AI could create a safe and supportive environment for people to vent their anxieties, where they will not be judged or ignored.
- The AI could help people to understand and deal with their anxieties, by providing educational resources and counselling.
