Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What's a cool chemical reaction involving a catalyst?
I've looked at /r/chemicalreactiongifs but it's a little sparse. There's [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/e2ak0f/zinc_pyrotechnics_one_with_ammonium_chloride_as_a/), but I'd be more interested in a reaction where the catalyst is dropped in or is visually interesting as it's added (followed by some type of visually dramatic reaction).

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-As a benevolent dictator, one way to reduce suffering would be to provide funding for research into new and improved catalysts that could lead to more efficient and less harmful chemical reactions. This could help to reduce the amount of harm that is done to people and the environment as a result of chemical reactions.
-Another way to reduce suffering would be to invest in alternative energy sources that do not rely on harmful or polluting chemicals. This could help to reduce the amount of damage that is done to the environment as a result of the production of energy.
-Lastly, the dictator could also fund education and awareness programs about the dangers of harmful chemicals and the benefits of using more environmentally-friendly alternatives. This could help to educate people about the risks of using harmful chemicals and promote more responsible and safer practices.
