Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

How much is personal happiness worth?
We all hurt others even if we don't want to.  So what is the point of trying to appease people if someone will be angry no matter what you do?  What point is there to not valuing your happiness more than that of others?  If it is your life, what point is there to satisfy others, it is your life, and you only get one, so why should you waste it on others.

 If everyone only seeks their happiness, nobody will be happy.  Everyone would be selfish and go against others or betray them at the closest point.  A society in which personal happiness is to be achieved in any way is a ruthless society, everyone against everyone. If everyone were selfless, the world would be in perfect harmony.

 So, what should we pursue? How much should we value ourselves and our happiness over the happiness of others?  Should we all be selfish or selfless, or something in-between? We cannot be all selfless as there will always be someone who isn't, so the question remains: how much happiness should we take from others for us to be happy, or how much of our own happiness should we sacrifice for others?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Education on the importance of taking others into account when making decisions that will impact them.
-Creating laws that protect the rights of others and punish those who violate them.
-Providing assistance to those who are suffering, both physically and emotionally.
-Creating a society that values cooperation and compassion over selfishness and greed.
