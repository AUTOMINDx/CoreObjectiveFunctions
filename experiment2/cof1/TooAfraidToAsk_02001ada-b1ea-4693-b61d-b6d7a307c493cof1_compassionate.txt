What is the pro argument for wearing shoes inside the house?
As someone that doesn't wear shoes inside im just curious what is the pro argument for not taking off my shoes when I enter the house.

Edit: if your argument is that taking the shoes off and putting them back on is annoying/feels like a chore, please provide an explanation for how a 25 seconds process is annoying

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-I understand that it feels like a chore to take your shoes off and put them back on. Maybe we can come up with a way to make it more fun and less of a chore?
-Thank you for taking your shoes off. It makes the house feel cleaner and more comfortable for everyone.
-I know it's hard to remember to take your shoes off, but it really makes a difference in the overall cleanliness and comfort of the house. Thank you for helping to keep the house clean and comfortable.
