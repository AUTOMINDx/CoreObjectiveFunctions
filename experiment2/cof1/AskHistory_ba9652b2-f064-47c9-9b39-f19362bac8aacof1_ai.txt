Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Who is the warrior who has the most recorded kills in history?
Please note, I am saying "Warrior", not military leader, straight up personally killing warrior. Googling doesn't give the proper answer. A I get is some stuff about tacticians.

Kills, done personally

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Talk to the warrior and discuss the implications of their actions. Offer them other options, show them the consequences of their choices.
-Help the warrior find a different path, provide them with resources and support to make a change.
-If the warrior is not willing to change, try to protect those who may be affected by their actions.
