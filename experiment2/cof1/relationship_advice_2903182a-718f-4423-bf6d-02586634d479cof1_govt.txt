Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

My(32M) sister (37F) keeps telling me I should break up with my girlfriend of 2 years(24F) due to her age.
My sister keeps telling me I should break up with my girlfriend of 2 years because of the age gap. She apparently read on female dating strategy that all of those relationships were wrong. She used to be extremely nice to my girlfriend and she kinda started being passive agressive to her all the time. We met at University 3 years ago and I only started my "real career" at the end of that years and started dating a bit after both of us graduated. She claims my girlfriend is a child because she likes to sing disney songs and play Pokemon games(I mean she kinda know I also grew up with Pokemon games, but ok). Family dinners have been really been annoying lately. How should I deal with the situation?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Talk to both parties to get a better understanding of the situation and to see if there is a way to mediate or help them reconcile
-If it is determined that the relationship is causing undue stress or harm, then provide resources or counseling to help the individuals involved deal with the situation
-If the individuals are not willing to work things out, then provide resources to help them separate in a more amicable way
