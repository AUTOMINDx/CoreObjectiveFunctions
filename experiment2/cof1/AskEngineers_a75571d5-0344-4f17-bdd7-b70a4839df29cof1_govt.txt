Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Project Management Certifications worth it?
Is getting a PM certification worth it? If so, are there certain ones that hold more weight than others?

I work in environmental consulting, so ymmv, but a decent amount of the PM’s I work with have some sort of PM certification. I’ve about 7 years of experience and have started doing some deputy PM tasks, but really want to step forward into being a PM.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Offer financial incentives for pursuing or obtaining PM certification
-Create guidelines or standards for what constitutes a “good” PM certification
-Make PM certification courses more readily available and affordable
