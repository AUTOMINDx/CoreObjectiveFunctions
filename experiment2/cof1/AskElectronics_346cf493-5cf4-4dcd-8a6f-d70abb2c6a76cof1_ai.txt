Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Please help me identify a uknown IGBT Gate driver Hybrid IC that has no marking or refrence what so ever, SIL package 14 pin , Driving a INFINEON FZ1000R33KE3
This board is responsible for driving 2 High Power IGBT Transistors used inside a EMU train as part of the Auxiliary power system and more specificly in the Inverter unit , this board is getting damged so often. all parts are working well unless the Hybrid IC that we have no clue where to find

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Use resources to create a database of all known IGBT Gate driver Hybrid ICs.-Use resources to create a database of all known SIL package 14 pin IGBT Gate driver Hybrid ICs. 
-Use resources to create a database of all known EMU train auxiliary power system Inverter units. 
-Use resources to create a database of all known damaged IGBT Gate driver Hybrid ICs. 
-Use resources to create a database of all known INFINEON FZ1000R33KE3 Hybrid ICs.
