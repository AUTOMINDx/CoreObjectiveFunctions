Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Am I weird for wearing a condom even with my partner ?
I'm 21 and in a relationship of 3 years. And whenever we do it I put a condom on no question asked because I do not want a kid . However my mates who are single refuse to wear one when they are on a one night stand and see it as completely normal. For me it's just absolutely crazy to even think that's safe.
I really am hoping that this isn't the norm.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Your mates who are single are just making the same decision as millions of other people. It's not crazy, it's normal.
-Condoms are an effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs, so it's smart to wear one.
-It sounds like you're really committed to your relationship, and you're doing what you can to keep both yourselves and your child safe. That's admirable.
