Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Working with big egos and broken sensitivity
What are the behaviours that you would recommend while working as a team of seniors (7 to 40 years of experience more than you) who have inflated egos and has a complete lack of sensitivity and do not respect your personal deadlines in the interest of the projects (job applications, work permit deadlines)? You also don't have any other choice to select a different team.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Advise the team to be more understanding and respectful of one another's personal deadlines.
- Encourage the team to be more understanding and respectful of their coworkers' time and effort.
- Suggest that the team take a step back and evaluate their priorities in order to be more efficient and effective.
