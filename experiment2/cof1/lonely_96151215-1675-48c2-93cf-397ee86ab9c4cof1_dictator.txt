Life feels stuck
I (27M) have been extremely lonely the past few months and I'm not sure how to go about getting out of it. All of my friends are married with kids so I don't have anyone to really hang out with these days so I end up doing everything alone and don't ever really have anyone to just chat with either. As far as relationships go, I would say I'm fairly decent looking though there could always be room for improvement but it seems lately I have had zero luck with dating apps or even just getting attention from women. I usually never had a problem getting into relationships in the past so I'm not sure what went wrong honestly lol. I find it kinda hard to meet new people these days since I quit going to bars. I really want to start a family of my own and get married but I'm just not sure if that's even in the cards for me anymore

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Introduce a social program that encourages people to get together and spend time together in a group setting. This program would could provide subsidies for group activities, or free memberships to clubs or organizations.
-Start a dating program that connects interested singles with each other. This program could pair people together based on interests or personality traits.
-Launch a public service campaign that promotes positive body image and healthy relationships. This campaign could provide information on how to have positive self-esteem and how to maintain healthy relationships.
