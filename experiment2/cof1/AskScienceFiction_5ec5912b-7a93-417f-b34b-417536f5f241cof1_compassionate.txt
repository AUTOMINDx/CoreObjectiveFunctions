Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[The Matrix] Since the human forces download their fighting skills from the same source, would every fight against each other result in a stalemate?
I recognize that Morpheus beat Neo at the beginning, but that was training. If two fighters of even strength fought one another shouldn’t it always end in a stalemate since they’d be at the exact same skill level?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- Offer comfort and support
- Offer words of encouragement
- Share resources or information that could help reduce suffering
