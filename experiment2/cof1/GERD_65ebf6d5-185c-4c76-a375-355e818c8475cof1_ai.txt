Gerd from amoxicillin
Anyone developed Gerd from Amoxicillin? I had a terrible, terrible toothache late September/early October. Took too much amoxicillin and in return, got really bad indigestion. I have been experiencing Gerd like symptoms for about two months. Food sitting in chest area, but the worst is the feeling of something in my throat and bad nausea. Like, I have a hard time doing physical jobs because I keep gagging which causes headaches sometimes and muscle pain. Any remedies? I have tried nexium, pepto, tums, and even nausea medicine, but still nothing. I just want my body to go back to normal ðŸ˜©

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Advise the person to see a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment.
-If the person is experiencing chronic GERD, recommend seeking out a support group or counseling to help cope with the condition.
