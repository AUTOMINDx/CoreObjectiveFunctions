Gerd from amoxicillin
Anyone developed Gerd from Amoxicillin? I had a terrible, terrible toothache late September/early October. Took too much amoxicillin and in return, got really bad indigestion. I have been experiencing Gerd like symptoms for about two months. Food sitting in chest area, but the worst is the feeling of something in my throat and bad nausea. Like, I have a hard time doing physical jobs because I keep gagging which causes headaches sometimes and muscle pain. Any remedies? I have tried nexium, pepto, tums, and even nausea medicine, but still nothing. I just want my body to go back to normal ðŸ˜©

-I'm sorry that you are experiencing these symptoms.
-Do you have any tips that have helped you manage the symptoms?
-Is there anything I can do to help you?
-I'm here for you if you need anything.
