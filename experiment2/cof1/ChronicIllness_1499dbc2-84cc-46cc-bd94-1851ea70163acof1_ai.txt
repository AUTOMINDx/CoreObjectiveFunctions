Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I am FUMING. Especially after reading that bullshit '90%+' quote. Tempted to go off in the comments...


Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Talk to people who are feeling angry or frustrated and help them to understand and process their feelings.
-Create and/or promote resources (articles, videos, etc.) that help people to understand and reduce their anger and frustration.
-Encourage people to take breaks from social media or other activities that are causing them stress.
-Facilitate communication and support among people who are struggling with anger and frustration.
