I was wondering if the traditional gender roles of men would also be changed. Why canâ€™t men be accepted if they are not providers and protectors.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:

-Encourage companies to provide flexible working arrangements so that both parents can balance work and family responsibilities.
