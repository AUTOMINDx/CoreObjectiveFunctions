Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Need to get my refill
And here we go. I can go out back and play, go to the store via car, go to my moms, but the THOUGHT of walking three minutes from my apartment to get my meds from the pharmacy is killing me. I'm tired of making my boyfriend pick them up for me every single month. Why does walking give me so much fckn anxiety?!?!?!?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- Offer to walk to the pharmacy with the person
- Suggest looking up a pharmacy closer to their home or work
- Suggest taking medication to help with the anxiety of walking
- Offer to pick up the person's prescription for them
