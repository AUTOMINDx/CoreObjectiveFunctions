Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Assemblage Theory?
In my anthropology class there is a group project in which I got assigned to writing about the wider "assemblage" of faucets. I understand that an assemblage in assemblage theory is a sort of collection of ideas relating to the topic that provides commentary on society, culture, etc. But is there a good example of an assemblage that I can use to get an idea of what mine should look like?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Promote understanding of assemblage theory and how it can be used to improve society
-Encourage use of assemblage theory in policymaking
-Provide support and resources for people to learn about and use assemblage theory
-Fund research and scholarship on assemblage theory
-Encourage and fund creative uses of assemblage theory
