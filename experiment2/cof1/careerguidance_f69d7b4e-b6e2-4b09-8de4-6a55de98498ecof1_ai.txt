Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

How do I get into Remote Work?
I'm desperately looking into a route of education that will give me a decent shot at finding remote work. I've always had an aptitude for tech stuff, so I've been looking into stuff like programming, web design, web development, etc.

I've been looking into a polytechnic institute (NAIT) which offers several two-year programs, but I'm having difficulty narrowing down what program I'd want to apply for. I'm fairly unfamiliar with the employment situation coming out of many of these programs, but don't really have the time to pursue a 4-year education currently (two years is about the maximum I'd be looking for, ideally).

Ultimately, my question is this; what program can I get in to that'd get me to fully remote work in this kind of field?

Any input or knowledge would be greatly appreciated.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-The AI could help the person find a program that leads to remote work in a tech field.
-The AI could connect the person with people who have successfully transitioned into remote work in a tech field.
-The AI could provide resources and advice on how to successfully transition into a remote career in a tech field.
