Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone feel like bright lights are a trigger? Especially at night?
Went to a Christmas lights show near my home and realized that looking at the bright lights and decorations brought me to reality, but as soon as I looked away DR hit super hard. Way worse than anything else.

I've always had this really strange sensation when I would look at Street lights and Christmas lights at night time. But never realized what it was till I learned about DPDR just recently.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "I'm so sorry that you're experiencing this. It must be really tough."
- "Is there anything I can do to help you cope or make it easier?"
- "How are you doing today?"
- "Can I get you anything?"
- "I'm here for you if you need to talk."
