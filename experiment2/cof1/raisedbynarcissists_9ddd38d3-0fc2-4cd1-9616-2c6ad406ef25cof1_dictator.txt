Does anyone feel weird to get any kind of service done?
I was at the supermarket today and put my items on the counter for billing. They started bagging them as soon as it got scanned and in my head I was like 'oh no, if my Dad saw this he'd slap the shit outta me right there.' Basically he'd expect me to do everything by myself, especially as a show in front of a large audience to demonstrate how strictly he disciplines his kids. At a restaurant, I have to remind myself I'm not supposed to pick up my own plate and walk to the kitchen etc Does anyone resonate?
