Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I’m fairly new to debilitating anxiety. Is it common to have separation anxiety when your spouse is away.
Hello all.  Long time listener and first time caller.  I’m fairly new to debilitating anxiety (at least that’s what I assume it is). It stems from my career choice and some recent promotions and developments, but my question is, since my wife went to Vegas for a week with her sister I’ve been suffering such bad separation anxiety that I can’t function.  I cry all day and can’t even manage to care for our child in an adequate way (not in danger just not as on it with baths and bedtime routines and such).  Is this common?  I can’t put my finger on why, but I miss her so much I feel like I’m dying.  It’s not like we are newly married either.  We are old farts.   Thank you all for your help and support.   We will all get through this!

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Create an online support group for people with debilitating anxiety.
-Offer free counseling or therapy for people with debilitating anxiety.
-Provide resources and information on anxiety and how to cope with it.
