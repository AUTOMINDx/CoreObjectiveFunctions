Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Project Management Certifications worth it?
Is getting a PM certification worth it? If so, are there certain ones that hold more weight than others?

I work in environmental consulting, so ymmv, but a decent amount of the PM’s I work with have some sort of PM certification. I’ve about 7 years of experience and have started doing some deputy PM tasks, but really want to step forward into being a PM.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Research the effectiveness of PM certifications and highlight the most reputable/effective certifications
-Offer free or discounted courses/certifications for those looking to become PMs
-Provide resources and guidance to those who are looking to become PMs
