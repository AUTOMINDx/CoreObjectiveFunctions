Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[OH] How quickly is EyeMed policy cancelled after ending employment?
My final day with my company is on Thursday. I wanted to get a eye appointment in before the coverage ends. Would I be able to go to the eye doctor, and order a new prescription on Thursday or Friday? How fast are these policies cancelled after your employment ends?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you're able to get an appointment in before your coverage ends."
- "I'm sorry that you have to go through this. I hope you can find a way to get the care you need."
- "Can I do anything to help you get the care you need?"
- "If there's anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to let me know."
