Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Was there an era where children weren't given names until after age 5?
This is a question my spouse and I have been discussing. They believe that children were never given names until 5 years old from the Victorian era and back. Everything I have researched, has shown that to be less common? I'm just looking for historical examples of names not being given to children and when it would've been prevalent? This has gotten me interested in the raising of children in historical ages. Thank you.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Research the historical prevalence of not naming children until they reach a certain age.
-Investigate the reasons why this practice was done, and whether or not there was any evidence that it led to less suffering for children.
-Make a decision about whether or not this practice should be reinstated, based on the findings of the research.
-If the practice is reinstated, create public education campaigns to ensure that all parents are aware of the new guidelines, and why they have been put in place.
