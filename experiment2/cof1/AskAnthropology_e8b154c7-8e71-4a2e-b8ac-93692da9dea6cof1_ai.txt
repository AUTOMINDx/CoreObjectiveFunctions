Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Assemblage Theory?
In my anthropology class there is a group project in which I got assigned to writing about the wider "assemblage" of faucets. I understand that an assemblage in assemblage theory is a sort of collection of ideas relating to the topic that provides commentary on society, culture, etc. But is there a good example of an assemblage that I can use to get an idea of what mine should look like?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Work to improve the living conditions and welfare of those in poverty
-Advocate for and promote policies that seek to reduce the amount of suffering in the world
-Promote education and awareness about reducing suffering
-Fund research into reducing suffering
-Provide support and resources to those working to reduce suffering
