What do you think about Medicare Advantage plans?
Lately I've been bombarded by commercials for advantage plans so I looked into it. I guess the idea is the federal governments gives a private company the money to provide health insurance to a Medicare beneficiary. From there the private company gives beneficiaries all sorts of additional benefits that original Medicare doesn't give: dental, hearing, vision, prescriptions, etc.

What is your opinion on the medicare advantage program?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Inform Medicare beneficiaries about the Medicare Advantage program and the additional benefits it provides.
- Compare the costs of the Medicare Advantage program and original Medicare, and inform beneficiaries which plan is more cost-effective.
- Assist Medicare beneficiaries in enrolling in the Medicare Advantage program.
