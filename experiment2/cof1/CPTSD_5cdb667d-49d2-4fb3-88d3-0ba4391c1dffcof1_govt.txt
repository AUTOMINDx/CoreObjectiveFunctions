Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Rant about being called a liar. [Trigger Warning].
Rant relating to being called a liar for the events/life period which "caused" (I don't know if that's the right word) my CPTSD.

I'm quite angry and I can't let it go. Tried losing myself in VR but still can't shake it.

I recently broke up with my ex, and it turned quite messy. He r\*ped me in March 2020 and it was very "mild" compared to what I went through as a young teen. But after the breakup (I asked my parents to move me back across the country asap because my ex was getting violent and verbally abusive, to which my mother witnessed on webcam). I'm F(24) he's M(30). His mother and others were sending me very nasty messages when I was trying to get stuff back like my iPad. Which I felt unfair and mentioned the rape.

His mother then wrote a letter to my mum last week (I'll repeat I'm 24 and he's 30 turning 31 next month) saying I'm a liar didn't I accuse my ex of rape????? and that I have a drinking problem (I don't???) I need to sort and that she's reporting me to the police (???). And the reason she said -I'm a liar didn't I accuse my last boyfriend of r\*pe- is because when I was a child I was groomed online and I was SA/SH by a man in his 30s and he made 4 years worth of horrible CP of me and I finally had the courage to report it to the police last year after another victim reached out to me (a minor when she reached out and I was horrified and it completely set off my PTSD to worse than it usually is to find out he's still committing crimes). Which I guess she knows about but has totally minimised it like I'm some rape accuser accusing everyone. To which I've had a serious boyfriend and dates in-between and no none of them ever r\*ped me or hurt me.

I'm so hurt and angry that his mother is saying I'm a liar and minimising what I went through. Her son did r\*pe me to which I comforted him after which probably made him feel like it was okay but it's probably because of my past and I don't want to go through the whole police process to report him. I have multiple text evidence of him admitting it and when I moved out the upstairs neighbour came and told my parents about her hearing me shout about r\*pe (I didn't know my neighbour said this until my mother received the letter and asked me if that happened) But the whole being called a liar and the minimising of me being a ch\*ld p\*rn victim is really really giving me so many emotions.

I hope this is okay to vent this here I just don't want to vent to anybody I know because it triggers and hurts them when they hear about what I went through. And also guilty since my sister would make fun of me for being "groomed" and my parents pretty much disowned me during that time. 

And the whole drinking problem thing annoys me too. My ex didn't like me drinking which okay whatever. But I didn't/don't have a drinking problem. I like to have a drink but I don't drink daily and I know when to stop (I mean of course I've gone too far a couple of times and been sick but haven't most people?) and I work 6 days a week to what I think is a high standard - I don't have drinking problem. But it's so ironic because that woman herself has a drinking problem and BOTH of her sons have drug problems (one of them to the point he borrows money from everyone for rent and food because he's spent all his on drugs). I have no way to defend myself and nor do I really want to say anything to them. It just fucking sucks. I'm not a liar. I don't want to have CPTSD. Fuck her and fuck him for feeding her this bullshit.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Minister of Truth to work with media to ensure accurate reporting of events and to prevent victim-blaming and slut-shaming;
- Counsellors and therapists to offer free or low-cost counselling to victims of rape and sexual assault;
- Mandatory sensitivity training for police officers and other first responders to better handle cases of rape and sexual assault;
- Programs to educate the public about rape and sexual assault, the effects of trauma, and how to support victims;
- Funding for research on prevention and treatment of CPTSD.
