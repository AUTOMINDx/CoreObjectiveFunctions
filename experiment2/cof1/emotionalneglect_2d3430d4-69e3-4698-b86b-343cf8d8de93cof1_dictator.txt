Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I'm keeping track of how I feel around my close friend.
We've been missing each other's calls. An important conversation was put on hold cause she hasn't listened to my vns yet. We're both busy now with uni and work. 

We're on a call now and I'm body doubling her while she works while I'm lying in bed. 

I don't feel the greatest and I feel I do the same with her (that maybe I'm not a good friend either). Maybe this friendship is running its course. 

I don't feel like I wanna ask her things or make a lot of conversation like I used to because I feel drained when I do that. Maybe i dont have the best intentions either and maybe this is another sign. 

I feel like I want this friendship to fade.

And for the first time in a while I don't care to question how I feel or what my gut feeling is trying to tell me.


.... Could this be another time where the neglected part of me wants to escape? And I'm actually in a great friendship?

Does my gut feeling mean anything at all?

(I just derailed again in the last two questions)

[edit: I am realising that I might have been mistaking certain feelings for feelings of closeness. That I don't feel much of the things a best friend is supposed to feel for another best friend, I just will myself to. ]

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Talk to friend about how you're feeling, and be honest about your concerns.
-Spend time with friend to reaffirm your friendship.
-If you feel like the friendship is running its course, talk to your friend about it and give them the opportunity to talk about their feelings as well.
- Make sure you're listening to your friend when they're talking to you, and be thoughtful about your responses.
-Make sure your intentions are good, and that you're not just using your friend for your own benefit.
