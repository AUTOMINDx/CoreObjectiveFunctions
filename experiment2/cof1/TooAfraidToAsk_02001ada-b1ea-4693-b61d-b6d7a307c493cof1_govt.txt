What is the pro argument for wearing shoes inside the house?
As someone that doesn't wear shoes inside im just curious what is the pro argument for not taking off my shoes when I enter the house.

Edit: if your argument is that taking the shoes off and putting them back on is annoying/feels like a chore, please provide an explanation for how a 25 seconds process is annoying

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Educate citizens on the health benefits of taking shoes off inside the house
-Install shoe racks near the entrance of the house to encourage people to take their shoes off
-Ensure that the floor is clean and free of debris to avoid slipping and injury
-Provide slippers or other footwear to guests that do not wish to take their shoes off
