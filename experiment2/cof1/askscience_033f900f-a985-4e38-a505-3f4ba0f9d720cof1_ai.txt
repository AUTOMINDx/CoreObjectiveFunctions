Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Why were the retro rocket packs on the Mercury capsules painted with silver and black stripes?
For years I thought the stripes were structural ribbing, but I've never been able to find any photos other than simple painted on stripe on the [Mercury spacecraft](https://www.cybermodeler.com/space/mercury/images/nasm_mercury_03.jpg). Why is that?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Helping to create awareness of and solutions to problems that cause suffering (e.g. poverty, famine, animal exploitation, environmental destruction, etc.)
-Providing resources and support to individuals and organizations working to reduce suffering
-Promoting humane, sustainable, and ethical practices that can help to reduce suffering
-Educating others about the importance of reducing suffering and how they can help
-Offering emotional support and encouragement to those working to reduce suffering
