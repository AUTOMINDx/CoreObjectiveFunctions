Is it bad to tell someone in an interview that your life aspiration is to own your own business?
Sometimes when asked in an interview where I see myself in 5-10 years I want to say a business owner. 

But, I'm afraid that is not what they want to hear, or is it? What is your take?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
- Advise the individual that it may be better to be truthful - that owning one's own business is not the only viable option for the future, and that there are many paths to success.
- Help the individual prepare for the interview by providing mock interviews and tips on how to answer this question.
- Encourage the individual to explore their interests and talents, and to think about what they really want in life.
