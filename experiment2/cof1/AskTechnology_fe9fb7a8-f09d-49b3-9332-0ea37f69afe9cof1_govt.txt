Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

My boss is tracking our location via an app. The app isn't usable with fake GPS. Any other options?
For what its worth if I thought our job needed tracking I wouldn't be against it but its in Construction with no other companies having to put up with this sort of thing. We are speaking to our union but in the mean time I need to log in and out each day or else I won't get paid.

Colleagues are nervous about taking water breaks, going to the toilet. Its just not right. I downloaded a fake GPS app but the tracking app is designed to not work if the fake GPS is activated. Does anyone know of an alternative or one that would work?

Thank you

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Advocate for employees with management to create a policy where employees can take breaks and use the bathroom without fear of repercussion
-Launch a public campaign to raise awareness about the tracking app and how it is affecting employees' work performance and livelihood
-Offer employees assistance and resources to help them find a workaround to the tracking app
