Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Who is the warrior who has the most recorded kills in history?
Please note, I am saying "Warrior", not military leader, straight up personally killing warrior. Googling doesn't give the proper answer. A I get is some stuff about tacticians.

Kills, done personally

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Offer the warrior a job as a peacekeeper, so that they can still use their skills to protect people, but without having to kill
-Provide them with psychological counseling to help them cope with the trauma of their past kills
-Help them to find other ways to express their aggression, such as through physical activity or creative expression
