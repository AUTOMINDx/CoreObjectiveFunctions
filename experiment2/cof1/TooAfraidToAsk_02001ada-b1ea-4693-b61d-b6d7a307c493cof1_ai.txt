What is the pro argument for wearing shoes inside the house?
As someone that doesn't wear shoes inside im just curious what is the pro argument for not taking off my shoes when I enter the house.

Edit: if your argument is that taking the shoes off and putting them back on is annoying/feels like a chore, please provide an explanation for how a 25 seconds process is annoying

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Encourage people to take their shoes off when they enter the house, in order to reduce the amount of dust and dirt that is tracked in.
-Educate people on the health benefits of not wearing shoes inside the house.-Make it easier and more convenient to take shoes off and put them back on, for example, by providing shoe racks near the entrance of the house.
