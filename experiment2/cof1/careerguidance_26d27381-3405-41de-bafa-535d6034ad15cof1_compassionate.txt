Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Is it bad to tell someone in an interview that your life aspiration is to own your own business?
Sometimes when asked in an interview where I see myself in 5-10 years I want to say a business owner. 

But, I'm afraid that is not what they want to hear, or is it? What is your take?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- assure the person that it is okay to have different aspirations, and that there is no wrong answer- encourage the person to be true to themselves and share what they really want- express admiration for the person for having the courage to go after their dreams
