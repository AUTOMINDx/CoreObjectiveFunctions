Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Tips for first-time interns?
Junior ME undergrad: Got a good internship this summer (manufacturing) at the beginning of the semester. Now it's nearing the end, my grades are fairly average (B average) but I'm suffering from major impostor syndrome. I also don't know how to "keep in touch" with the recruiters that I have talked to (I sent a thank you email for my interview and offer letter but that's it), should I be emailing them? About what?

I often feel like I don't deserve that internship that I got. I feel like I'm not learning anything. I have a semester left till the date but I'd like to know what I can do to improve and prepare.

Thank you!

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Send follow-up emails to recruiters/employers to check in and see how the intern is doing and offer help if needed
-Offer resume/job advice and tips to the intern
-Connect the intern with other interns in the company or with employees who have been in the company for a long time to offer advice and wisdom
