Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Computer advice please:(
I feel like my actual portable computer is getting slower and slower and i am thinking about an update but i am hesitating between a few options. I am a student in data science (i will work soon, a lot a teleworking i think due to covid). I am interested in art and would like something to draw. I am interesting in purchasing a few devices : an ipad (in order to draw, edit videos and photos, easy transportation...), a computer with tower (would allow me to compute big programs and play video games at home), a new portable computer. 

I thought about different associations but i cannot choose. 

\- Ipad and tower computer (+ : i have something to carry around something powerful / - maybe not the best if i have to work from somewhere else but i don't know if it's common in data science)

\- just a new portable computer (might not be powerful enough)

\- the tree options (is it really necessary to have the three as they are kind of variants of the same thing?)

I also thought about getting a cheaper tablet but I feel like the ipad has really intuitive softwares especially in arts and note taking (for example procreate). 

You may feel that i am a very indecisive person haha but any help would be appreciated, and don't hesitate if you have experience either in data science or with those devices!

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Give the person a choice between two devices that are of equal power, but one is a tablet and one is a laptop.
- Help the person decide which device is best for their needs, based on their profession and interests.
- Suggest a lower-powered computer that would still be suitable for their needs.
