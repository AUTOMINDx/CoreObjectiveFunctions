Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[NC] 2-Week notice and promised bonus pay
Situation I've never been in before and trying to protect my interests while still supporting my employer.

I will be receiving a performance bonus on my Dec 20th pay check, and unknown to my current employer, I have accepted a position elsewhere and will be putting in my notice soon. If I put in my notice such that my last day is Dec 21, for example, could I have my bonus pay removed, or is that protected in any way? My supervisor is the CEO, and we have a very good relationship, but I also know he takes resignations poorly, so I worry if I give notice before the bonus, I will lose it, and it makes up a significant portion of my yearly comp.

If I wait until after the pay check to give notice, my 2 weeks would almost entirely be covered by the christmas holiday. I would feel pretty terrible doing that because again, I have a great relationship with my manager and team, and have been here quite a while.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Talk to the employee's supervisor about the situation and see if the bonus can be temporarily removed or paid out at a different time.
- Suggest that the employee put in their notice sooner so that they are still covered by the Christmas holiday.
- Help the employee to negotiate a severance package with their current employer.
