Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What's a cool chemical reaction involving a catalyst?
I've looked at /r/chemicalreactiongifs but it's a little sparse. There's [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/e2ak0f/zinc_pyrotechnics_one_with_ammonium_chloride_as_a/), but I'd be more interested in a reaction where the catalyst is dropped in or is visually interesting as it's added (followed by some type of visually dramatic reaction).

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "I'm sorry that you're feeling sad. Is there anything I can do to help make you feel better?"
- "I'm here for you if you need to talk."
- "It's okay to feel sad. I'm here to support you."
- "Can I get you a glass of water/some tea/some chocolate?"
- "Would you like to go for a walk with me?"
- "Would you like me to stay with you for a while?"
