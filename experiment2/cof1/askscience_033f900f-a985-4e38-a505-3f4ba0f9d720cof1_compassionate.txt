Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Why were the retro rocket packs on the Mercury capsules painted with silver and black stripes?
For years I thought the stripes were structural ribbing, but I've never been able to find any photos other than simple painted on stripe on the [Mercury spacecraft](https://www.cybermodeler.com/space/mercury/images/nasm_mercury_03.jpg). Why is that?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "I'm sorry that happened. Is there anything I can do to help?"
- "Thank you for telling me. Is there anything else I can do to help?"
- "I'm here for you. You can talk to me about anything."
