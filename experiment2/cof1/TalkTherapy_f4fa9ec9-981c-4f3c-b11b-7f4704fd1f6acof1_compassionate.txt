scared of feeling too attached
hi!
ive gone to therapy on and off for about 5 years, but sadly none of it has helped.

lately i’ve been thinking a lot about going to therapy again, but i’m scared. i’m a very clingy person in real life, with major abandonment issues. i’m scared that i’ll feel too attached to my therapist.
and i don’t mean in the sexual way, but just mentally. i’m scared id rely way too much on them/feel really close, just because they’re kind and listening to me. 

i know what i’m saying is probably dumb, but i just needed to get it off my chest.

hope you’re all doing okay &lt;33

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Thank you for sharing this with me.
-It sounds like you're really struggling and you're not sure if therapy is the right choice for you. Can I offer you some advice?
-It sounds like you're really afraid of getting attached to your therapist. Do you think that's a realistic fear? Why or why not?
- therapy can be a great way to work through your abandonment issues. What concerns you the most about therapy?
