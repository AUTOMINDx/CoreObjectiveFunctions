Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Whats your thoughts on the mens rights movement?
Eddit to correct an error: with mens rights movement I didnt mean MRM but as an umbrella term for groups that want to solve mens problems


I mean the non extreme mens rights so not women hating/mens surpremacy movement

Cause it looks like a loot of people think you can either be a Feminist or a mens rights activist and that these two groups have to fight each other while in reality these two movements could fight together for a lot of things supporting each other instead of hateing and hindering one another

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Publicize the benefits of men's rights activism to help reduce the stigma associated with it, and encourage people to get involved in peaceful advocacy for men's rights.
-Work to create legislation and policies that support men's rights, and work to repeal legislation and policies that are harmful to men.
-Provide resources and support to men who are experiencing difficulties due to traditional gender roles, such as lack of access to child custody, employment, and health services.
-Educate the public about the ways in which boys and men are disadvantaged in society, and work to promote gender equality.
