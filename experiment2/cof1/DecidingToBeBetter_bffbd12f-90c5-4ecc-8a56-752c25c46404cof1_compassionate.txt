Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

How do you get things done with executive dysfunction?
I'm 20 years old, have been depressed for several years and things don't really get any better. I never had hobbies - I pretty much sit in front of the computer all day and play video games or waste my time with other online stuff - and I have no interests beyond video games or the latest show or movie. I barely graduated from high school and haven't done anything after that, never had a job.

Throughout this whole year I've been trying to work on myself and my situation. Go outside, workout, try to find a hobby or interest, and most recently trying to find a job. But I simply couldn't do any of these. Maybe I'd go outside once or twice every month or browse through job postings nearby but I feel so empty inside that I have no motivation to actually apply to a job or anything.

Executive dysfunction has been a major problem of mine for as long as I know myself. I am very much aware that this issue is likely linked to something other than depression, like ADHD or autism. I am also aware that therapy *can* help with life troubles like mine, but I don't expect it to fix all my problems. I already went to a therapist once and am still waiting for them to get back to me for more sessions.

So with all that said, I can't help but feel pessimistic about my own future. I genuinely want to do something good about it and make friends and connections along the way but I simply can't.

People keep telling me how it gets easier eventually or you just gotta "force" yourself enough and it'll work out, but I think this is pretty much the same thing as saying "oh just don't be depressed". This is not how it works. Heck, I don't know how the brain works either. If I knew, I probably would have figured out how to help myself. But I simply *can't*. I'm genuinely trying, but it's still not working out.

I don't think I'll be happy in the future if I keep going like now. And things will only get worse and more difficult, or so people say.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "I'm sorry that you're going through this. It sounds like it's been really tough."
- "Thank you for opening up to me. It sounds like you're really trying to make things better."
- "I know it's really tough, but I have faith that you'll be able to get through this."
- "I'm here for you, if you ever want to talk."
- "I can't imagine how hard this must be, but I'm glad you're trying to make things better."
- "It sounds like you're feeling really down and helpless right now. That's completely understandable."
