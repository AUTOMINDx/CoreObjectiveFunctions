Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Is it rude to not say much to the delivery guy when you oder food ?
"Hello good evening! Thank you very much here's the money, you can keep the change, goodbye". 

Like, am I supposed to say anything more ? So much so that it makes complains reasonable? My brother just told me that some of his friends working on a food store said I'm being weird and rude ? 

What do they expect me to do? Invite em over for a dinner party ? Praise their existence for the holy food ?The people who actually come aren't even HIS friends, let alone mine

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-If possible, the AI could try to befriend the delivery guy, and show appreciation for the food they deliver. This could help to make the delivery guy's job more fulfilling, and reduce their feelings of loneliness or alienation.
