Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Assemblage Theory?
In my anthropology class there is a group project in which I got assigned to writing about the wider "assemblage" of faucets. I understand that an assemblage in assemblage theory is a sort of collection of ideas relating to the topic that provides commentary on society, culture, etc. But is there a good example of an assemblage that I can use to get an idea of what mine should look like?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Creating awareness campaigns to educate citizens on the issues
-Providing financial assistance and subsidies to those who are suffering
-Creating and enforcing regulations and laws that protect citizens and work to reduce suffering
-Providing social services and support programs to help those who are suffering
