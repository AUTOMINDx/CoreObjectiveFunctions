Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-If the AI determines that the individual is suffering from a panic disorder, it could provide support and resources to help the individual manage their condition.
-If the AI determines that the individual is not sleeping well because of the panic disorder, it could recommend treatment options or therapies that may help the individual sleep better.
