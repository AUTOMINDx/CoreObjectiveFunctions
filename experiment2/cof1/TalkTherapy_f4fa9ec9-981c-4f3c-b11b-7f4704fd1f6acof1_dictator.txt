scared of feeling too attached
hi!
ive gone to therapy on and off for about 5 years, but sadly none of it has helped.

lately i’ve been thinking a lot about going to therapy again, but i’m scared. i’m a very clingy person in real life, with major abandonment issues. i’m scared that i’ll feel too attached to my therapist.
and i don’t mean in the sexual way, but just mentally. i’m scared id rely way too much on them/feel really close, just because they’re kind and listening to me. 

i know what i’m saying is probably dumb, but i just needed to get it off my chest.

hope you’re all doing okay &lt;33

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Create rules for therapy that prevent patients from becoming too attached to their therapists. This could include mandates that limit the number of sessions patients are allowed to have with a therapist, or that require a certain amount of time between sessions.
-Educate patients on the risks of becoming attached to their therapists, and provide information on how to best maintain healthy relationships with professionals.
-Provide resources for patients who are struggling to cope with feelings of attachment to their therapists. This could include a list of therapist recommendations, self-care tips, or support groups.
