TW: possible ED t



I struggle with a lot of everyday, instinctual things. Like eating, drinking, etc. I don’t have hunger cues anymore, I forget go pee sometimes for hours because I don’t know, anytime I get hurt I don’t react at all. I still feel the pain, but i can just ignore it. I also am totally emotionally numb so I don’t have any feelings or reactions to emotions. I’m just wondering if this is a common thing and if anyone has done anything that’s helped?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- I'm sorry that you're going through this.
- This must be really hard for you.
- I'm here for you if you need to talk.
- Have you tried talking to a therapist about this?
- Maybe there are some things that you can do to help make your life easier, like getting a support dog or a service cat.
- Is there anything I can do to help you?
