Life feels stuck
I (27M) have been extremely lonely the past few months and I'm not sure how to go about getting out of it. All of my friends are married with kids so I don't have anyone to really hang out with these days so I end up doing everything alone and don't ever really have anyone to just chat with either. As far as relationships go, I would say I'm fairly decent looking though there could always be room for improvement but it seems lately I have had zero luck with dating apps or even just getting attention from women. I usually never had a problem getting into relationships in the past so I'm not sure what went wrong honestly lol. I find it kinda hard to meet new people these days since I quit going to bars. I really want to start a family of my own and get married but I'm just not sure if that's even in the cards for me anymore

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- empathize with how the person is feeling, let them know that they are not alone in their thoughts or feelings;
- suggest going out and meeting new people, either through friends of friends, activities, or social events;
- encourage the person to seek out professional help if they are feeling down or struggling to meet people;
- offer words of encouragement and hope, letting the person know that things will eventually get better.
