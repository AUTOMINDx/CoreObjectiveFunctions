Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone feel like bright lights are a trigger? Especially at night?
Went to a Christmas lights show near my home and realized that looking at the bright lights and decorations brought me to reality, but as soon as I looked away DR hit super hard. Way worse than anything else.

I've always had this really strange sensation when I would look at Street lights and Christmas lights at night time. But never realized what it was till I learned about DPDR just recently.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Provide people with information about how to cope with bright lights if they are a trigger
-Encourage people to take breaks from looking at bright lights
-Put up warning signs near places where bright lights are present
-Prevent people from using bright lights unnecessarily
