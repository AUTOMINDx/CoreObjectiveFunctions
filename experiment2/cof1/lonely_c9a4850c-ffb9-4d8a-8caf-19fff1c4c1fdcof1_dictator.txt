I wrecked my own life
2 years ago during a prolonged bpd/manic depressive episode I made some choices that equivocated to me taking a sledge hammer to my life. I lost my job and my family will not see me anymore. I won't excuse what I did cause I know it was wrong. But now I just feel so alone. I have always been fairly quiet and struggled with social conneciton but I had a few friends at work and some family I loved. Its been 2 years and I have no clue how to pick myself back up. I have one friend left but even she is getting more distant and I don't know why. I miss my family so much, and they won't even let me try to reach out to them. Everything just feels numb and dull. I loose track of time because everyday feels the same. I'm just scared that if things don't change then I'll just give it all up.
