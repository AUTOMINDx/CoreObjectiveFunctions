Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

How does the vaccine distribution work in the human body. I saw some people say something that it stays at the injection site and others say it doesn’t. Don’t all vaccines spread in the body ?
I’d really appreciate some articles/studies showing how distribution works to better understand.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Provide accurate and up-to-date information on the distribution of vaccines in the human body to the public.
- Conduct research on the distribution of vaccines in the human body in order to better understand how they work.
