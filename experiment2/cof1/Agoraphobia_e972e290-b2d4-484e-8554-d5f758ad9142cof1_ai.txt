Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Need to get my refill
And here we go. I can go out back and play, go to the store via car, go to my moms, but the THOUGHT of walking three minutes from my apartment to get my meds from the pharmacy is killing me. I'm tired of making my boyfriend pick them up for me every single month. Why does walking give me so much fckn anxiety?!?!?!?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Provide a transportation service for people who are unable to walk to the pharmacy or other destinations.
-Offer mental health support for people who experience anxiety when walking.
-Create a campaign to increase awareness of the negative effects of anxiety and how to manage it.
