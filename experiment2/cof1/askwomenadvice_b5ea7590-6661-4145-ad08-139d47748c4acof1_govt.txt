What should I (52f) do if my gf’s bf sent messages fb friend request? FYI both of them are my hiking friends, but I’m much closer to her than him, and I’m one of her fb friends now.
Should I tell her or not

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Establish clear communication guidelines for social media platforms.
-If there are any ambiguous social media interactions, advise the parties involved to communicate directly with each other to resolve any issues.
-If communication between parties does not result in a resolution, then the government can provide an impartial mediator to help facilitate a resolution.
