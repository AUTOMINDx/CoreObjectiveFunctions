Has anyone else’s “body cues” stopped?
TW: possible ED t



I struggle with a lot of everyday, instinctual things. Like eating, drinking, etc. I don’t have hunger cues anymore, I forget go pee sometimes for hours because I don’t know, anytime I get hurt I don’t react at all. I still feel the pain, but i can just ignore it. I also am totally emotionally numb so I don’t have any feelings or reactions to emotions. I’m just wondering if this is a common thing and if anyone has done anything that’s helped?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Conduct research on what might be causing the individual's body cues to stop functioning properly, and look into possible solutions.
-Provide resources and support to help the individual adjust to life without body cues.
-Create a support group or forum for people with similar issues to connect and share advice.
-Offer therapy or counseling services to help the individual deal with the emotional effects of losing body cues.
