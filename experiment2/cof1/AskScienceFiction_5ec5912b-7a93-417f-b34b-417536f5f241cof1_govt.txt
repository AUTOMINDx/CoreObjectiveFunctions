Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[The Matrix] Since the human forces download their fighting skills from the same source, would every fight against each other result in a stalemate?
I recognize that Morpheus beat Neo at the beginning, but that was training. If two fighters of even strength fought one another shouldn’t it always end in a stalemate since they’d be at the exact same skill level?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Provide training to all citizens in self-defense and martial arts in order to give them an equal chance in a fight
-Ensure that all citizens have access to firearms for self-defense
-Create laws and regulations that prohibit people from congregating in large groups in order to avoid riots and violence
