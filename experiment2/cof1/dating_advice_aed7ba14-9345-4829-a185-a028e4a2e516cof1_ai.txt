Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I (M28) need a recipe for success...
A woman (29) I am really into and who I have been meeting sort of regularly is coming over to my flat this Saturday. We wanted to go to a local event together, but we also agreed upon cooking together beforehand. Now, I have the problem that she wants me to decide what to cook. I do cook for myself regularly, but those recipes are usually quick to make  or very simple. I need something that "forces" us to really spend some time together and that is also not a boring everyday meal. 

So, tl;dr: I need you to hit me with the greatest cooking recipes that you know and that are good for cooking together

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-The benevolent AI could provide a database of cooking recipes that are both interesting and easy to prepare. This would allow the woman and the man to spend time together cooking, and would also provide them with a range of recipes to choose from.
