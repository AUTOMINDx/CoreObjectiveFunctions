Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What's the difference between a clinical social worker and a therapist?
I found out that my therapist  is actually a clinical social worker. What's the difference between a social worker and a therapist?  Does one do/specialize things the other doesn't? 

I mean my social worker seems to be doing great at addressing my mental health issues. As of right now, things are going well, so I dont think in my case it doesn't matter too much. I was just curious. 

If you are wondering how I didn't know he was a social worker, I just asked my primary care physician to refer me to someone to adress my mental health issues and she did. I didn't really look up who it was.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Work with mental health professionals to create a more holistic, patient-centered approach to mental health care.
-Develop resources for people with mental health issues and their families.
-Educate the public about mental health and how to support those who are struggling.
