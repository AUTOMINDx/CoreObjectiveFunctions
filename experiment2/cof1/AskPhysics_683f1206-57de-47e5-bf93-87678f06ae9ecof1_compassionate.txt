Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Non-academic STEM jobs for theoretical physicists!
It seems positive to me how experimental physicists would be useful outside of academia, namely working as engineers, lab-techs, devs, or something else technical and hands-on. Similarly ‏‏‎ the computational side of theoretical physics seems useful in data science, which is pretty ubiquitous in STEM and finance. Are there other STEM-style jobs in which the skills of theoretical physicists are useful? Is mathematical modelling in high demand? Thanks.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Thank you for your input.
-That sounds like it would be a fulfilling career.
-I'm glad you found a career that you love.
