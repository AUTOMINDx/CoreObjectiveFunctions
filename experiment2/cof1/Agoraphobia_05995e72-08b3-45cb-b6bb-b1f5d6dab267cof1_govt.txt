Frustrating
When you finally open up to someone online but then they think youâ€™re catfishing them, but you really arenâ€™t ðŸ˜«

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Have an online safety campaign that educates people on how to spot a fake profile and what to do if they are catfished.
- Have a helpline for people who have been catfished, so they can talk to someone about the experience and get support.
- Work with social media platforms to create more tools that help people protect themselves from being catfished, for example, verifying the profiles of people they are talking to.
