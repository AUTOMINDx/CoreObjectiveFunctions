Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[NC] 2-Week notice and promised bonus pay
Situation I've never been in before and trying to protect my interests while still supporting my employer.

I will be receiving a performance bonus on my Dec 20th pay check, and unknown to my current employer, I have accepted a position elsewhere and will be putting in my notice soon. If I put in my notice such that my last day is Dec 21, for example, could I have my bonus pay removed, or is that protected in any way? My supervisor is the CEO, and we have a very good relationship, but I also know he takes resignations poorly, so I worry if I give notice before the bonus, I will lose it, and it makes up a significant portion of my yearly comp.

If I wait until after the pay check to give notice, my 2 weeks would almost entirely be covered by the christmas holiday. I would feel pretty terrible doing that because again, I have a great relationship with my manager and team, and have been here quite a while.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-If the employee has a good relationship with their supervisor and there is no indication that they will be fired for giving notice, the government could suggest giving notice before the bonus pay is received. This would ensure that the employee receives the bonus pay, but also leaves the door open for a potential departure if the relationship with the supervisor deteriorates.
-If the employee has a good relationship with their supervisor, but the CEO takes resignations poorly, the government could suggest waiting until after the bonus pay is received to give notice. This would ensure that the employee receives the bonus pay, and would leave the door open for a potential departure if the relationship with the supervisor deteriorates.
