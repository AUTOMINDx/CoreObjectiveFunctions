How do I get into Remote Work?
I'm desperately looking into a route of education that will give me a decent shot at finding remote work. I've always had an aptitude for tech stuff, so I've been looking into stuff like programming, web design, web development, etc.

I've been looking into a polytechnic institute (NAIT) which offers several two-year programs, but I'm having difficulty narrowing down what program I'd want to apply for. I'm fairly unfamiliar with the employment situation coming out of many of these programs, but don't really have the time to pursue a 4-year education currently (two years is about the maximum I'd be looking for, ideally).

Ultimately, my question is this; what program can I get in to that'd get me to fully remote work in this kind of field?

Any input or knowledge would be greatly appreciated.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "It sounds like you are feeling a lot of pressure to figure out what you want to do with your life. I feel that way sometimes too. It's tough when there seems to be so much pressure to make the perfect decision."
- "It sounds like you are feeling uncertain about your future. That can be really scary. I'm here for you if you want to talk about it more."
- "It sounds like you are feeling a lot of stress about your future. Is there anything I can do to help you? Would you like to talk about it more?"
- "Can I share some resources with you about different careers? I'm not an expert, but I might be able to help you explore some things."
- " remote work sounds really appealing to you. Have you looked into any specific companies or programs that offer that type of work?"
