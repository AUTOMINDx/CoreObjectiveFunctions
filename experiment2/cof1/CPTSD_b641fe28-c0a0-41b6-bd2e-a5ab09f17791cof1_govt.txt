Do you try to sabotage your healthy romantic relationship(s)?
I am in a happy relationship, and have a very supportive partner. I often find it difficult to accept that they do love me, and worry about things going wrong, which in turn makes me want to sabotage my relationship. I have intrusive thoughts sometimes about, how I could hurt them before or in case they hurt me, etc. Do other sufferers of PTSD also experience this? I donâ€™t understand why I sometimes want to push away a wonderful thing.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Provide adequate resources for mental health services, including therapy and medication.
- Provide education on mental health and PTSD.
- Advocate for better mental health policies.
- Fund research on PTSD and other mental health disorders.
