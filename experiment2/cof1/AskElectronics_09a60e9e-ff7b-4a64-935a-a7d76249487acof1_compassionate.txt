Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Isopropyl alcohol is conductive in the MOhms range
Yesterday I was cleaning a motherboard with it, and troubleshoting a malfunction. and it stopped to power on. After sometime I gave up, and went online and bought another one with processor and RAM.

A couple hours ago I tried to turn it on, and it just worked fine. I guess the Isopropyl was somehow still not all dry yesterday. :(

It says 99.5% purity on the label

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-I'm sorry that happened.
-That sounds really frustrating.
-Is there anything I can do to help you?
-Thank you for trying to fix it.
-That's really unlucky.
