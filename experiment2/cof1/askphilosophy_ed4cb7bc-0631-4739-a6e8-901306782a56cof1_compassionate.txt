Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Relation between morality and self interest
Hello,

Can someone help me by giving me suggestions what is the relation between morality and self interest? (we were asked to find different relations and we choose one of them and try to back it up with examples)

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "I'm sorry that happened. You're not alone."
- "You're worth more than that."
- "That doesn't sound like fun."
- "Thank you for sharing."
- "How can I help you?"
- "Let's brainstorm some solutions."
- "I'm here for you."
- "Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?"
