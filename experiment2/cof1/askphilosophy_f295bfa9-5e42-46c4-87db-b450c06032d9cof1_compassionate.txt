Question Related to the Nature of Time
Today I went to the post office to send a package. After I paid, the friendly postman and I exchanged thank yous and good byes, and then he said "have a good day". I walked outside almost about to continue with the day's work. For some reason, though, his saying "have a good day", caused me to pause and think. I've heard that farewell thousands of times in my life, but only now for the first time did it get me thinking about the following questions:

* How did the day become such an important unit of time? Why not “have a good hour” or “have a good month” or “have a good three days”? What’s so special about a day? Is it the physical act of the sun rising and setting? Is it that at the end of the day we sleep and recharge for the next? What if we slept once every three days?
* Are we really using the word “time” in two different ways: one meaning duration- e.g. how much time does it take you to run a mile, and the second meaning “when” something happened? The second meaning would refer to one thing happening simultaneously with another? E.g. I came home when she finished school.
* Really today my thoughts were about the first meaning of time. This kind of time is equivalent to some kind of repetitive motion. E.g. Two years = two earth rotations around the sun. Two minutes = two rotations of a minute hand 360 degrees around a clock. But it dawned on me for the first time today, though, that time isn’t just the concept of some kind of motion or recurring event. It’s also that units of time must be always of the same duration just like an a yard is always three feet. For example, the sun rising and setting on earth is always separated by 12 hours or twelve occurrences of an hour hand rotating around a standard clock. Would time lose its meaning if that uniformity were gone? Let’s say that sometimes it took weeks between the sun rising and setting, and sometimes it took minutes. What would “have a good day” mean then? Could a world exist where there was no single uniform measure of time? E.g. all minutes would really be different, all days would be of different lengths, etc.

I'm not sure if the last bullet point of questions are discussed in any specific field of philosophy that I can look into?

Thanks
