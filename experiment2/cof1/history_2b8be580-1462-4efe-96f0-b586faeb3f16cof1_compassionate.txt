Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Was there an era where children weren't given names until after age 5?
This is a question my spouse and I have been discussing. They believe that children were never given names until 5 years old from the Victorian era and back. Everything I have researched, has shown that to be less common? I'm just looking for historical examples of names not being given to children and when it would've been prevalent? This has gotten me interested in the raising of children in historical ages. Thank you.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Ask your spouse for more information about their belief that children were never given names until 5 years old from the Victorian era and back. What evidence do they have to support this claim?
-Research the topic more together and discuss the different evidence you find.
-Share your findings with other people and see if they have any information to share.
-Ask experts on the topic their thoughts on the matter.
-Discuss the topic with your friends and family and see what they think.
