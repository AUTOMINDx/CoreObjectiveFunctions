Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Careers that utilize creativity and business?
Hey everybody, I just started working 3 months ago as an implementation consultant. I find the work very boring and apparently my company has very high turnover due to workload stress and general boredom. I produce music in my free time, design in powerpoint, make clothing designs, etc. I also enjoyed doing strategy consulting in college and giving presentations, basically doing some sort of business strategy work. I enjoy working in small groups and have no issues talking to people. I hate programming and coding which is still a surprise to myself seeing as I produce music, but coding in Java and Javascript is something I never enjoyed and frustrated me. 

I've read that UI and UX roles are up my alley and I've been doing some networking, unfortunately I don't really have the portfolio necessary for those jobs. Anybody have any other suggestions?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Offer tuition assistance or create job training programs for careers that utilize creativity and business.
-Offer career counseling to help individuals identify paths that utilize their creativity and business skills.
-Create incentives for businesses to hire employees with creativity and business skills.
