Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Filling an ethically questionable job if I am committed to making it better than someone else would?
Hi everyone. Need advice.

I'm interviewing for a job that I find ethically questionable, to say the least. Think salesman for company that provides, among its products, very high interest rate loans for people with low credit.

However, I feel that I'm in a position to demand a veto against any egregious products. In other words, in my mind, taking this job would mean that fewer people would get sucked into harsh loan cycles than if I forego the job and let someone else take it who is less concerned with this ethical issue.

I think I know the answer here... Just help me understand why I shouldn't take the job.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-The AI could encourage the potential employee to research the company and the products that it offers in order to make an informed decision.
-The AI could encourage the potential employee to reach out to others who may have worked for the company or have knowledge of its products in order to get more information.
-The AI could help the potential employee to create a list of demands or conditions that must be met in order for them to take the job. This could include things like being able to veto any egregious products, working only with certain customers, or having a say in the company's marketing strategy.
