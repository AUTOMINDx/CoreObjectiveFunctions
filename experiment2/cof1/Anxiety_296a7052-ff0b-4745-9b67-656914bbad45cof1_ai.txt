Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Do you ever feel like you vent or put too much on someone?
I have really bad anxiety and I feel like I put too much on my boyfriend. I vent to him about things that go through my head. I know that he is always there to listen and he handles my anxiety so well but sometimes I feel bad for him. 

Does anyone else feel like they put too much on someone? 

Please be nice ðŸ˜Š
