Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[OH] How quickly is EyeMed policy cancelled after ending employment?
My final day with my company is on Thursday. I wanted to get a eye appointment in before the coverage ends. Would I be able to go to the eye doctor, and order a new prescription on Thursday or Friday? How fast are these policies cancelled after your employment ends?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Prior to ending employment, provide employees with a clear timeline of when their health insurance policy will terminate.
-If an employee needs medical care after their policy has terminated, provide them with a reasonable timeframe to receive care and cover the costs associated with that care.
-Work with EyeMed and other health insurance providers to ensure a smooth transition for employees who are losing their health insurance.
