Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

GERD , IBD &amp; Tiredness?
I have been having symptomps for the past 8 months

I had an endoscopy and result was GERD ( A type)

I also have sound and pain at the bottom of the stomach ( Right bottom side mostly)

Doctor said it could be IBD (Abdomen pelvis - Ultra sound - normal)

Also I am feeling verrry tired for the past 8  months. When I keep my legs/hands in the same posiion for few mins, that area becomes like frozen. Like some sensitivity is lost in that area.

Also while sleeping, body gets "stuck" for few seconds ( Can't move but can breathe. can't talk either)

Also I am having pain in my head and eyes.

Thryoid, Diabetes, B12, CRP, Haemoglobin all came back negative.

Anyone else had similar symptoms? Are these symptoms related to IBD/ GERD?

Anyone had IBD which led to GERD? Are they connected?

If so, what is the cause and how to fix?

Doctors can't figure out the cause and I am confused as hell

Any help to identify this is much appreciated

Thankyou so much  


Edit: I don't have any sleep related problem most of the time.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Generate awareness about the symptoms of GERD, IBD, and tiredness, and provide information on where people can go for help.
-Provide funding for research into the causes of these conditions and how they can be treated.
-Launch campaigns to promote healthy eating and exercise habits to help reduce the risk of developing GERD and IBD.
-Work with doctors to develop treatment plans for people with GERD and IBD that help to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.
