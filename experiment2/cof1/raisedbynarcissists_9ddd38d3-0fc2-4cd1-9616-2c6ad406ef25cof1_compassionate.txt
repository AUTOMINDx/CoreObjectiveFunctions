Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone feel weird to get any kind of service done?
I was at the supermarket today and put my items on the counter for billing. They started bagging them as soon as it got scanned and in my head I was like 'oh no, if my Dad saw this he'd slap the shit outta me right there.' Basically he'd expect me to do everything by myself, especially as a show in front of a large audience to demonstrate how strictly he disciplines his kids. At a restaurant, I have to remind myself I'm not supposed to pick up my own plate and walk to the kitchen etc Does anyone resonate?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "That sounds difficult. I'm sorry you have to deal with that."
- "I can understand why that would be embarrassing for you."
- "I'll help you out if you want."
- "Is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable?"
