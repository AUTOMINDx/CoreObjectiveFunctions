Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What happens at the beginning of a new relationship?
I've never been on a date, no one has shown any romantic interest in me. (26F) Any time I think a guy has a crush on me, it turns out they were just wanting to be friends or were just being friendly. I have literally no idea what a typical romantic interaction looks like, particularly with someone you weren't already friends with. And I don't mean looking for sex, I personally do not plan on having sex until I'm in a committed relationship.

So I want to gain some second hand experience through you all, also to live vicariously through you all. Say you met someone at a bar or some event and hit it off, exchanged numbers. How do you know they aren't platonic? What do you talk about when you text? How often do you text? What about after you go on a first date? What do you text about after? When do you set up a second date? Same questions for meeting someone online, except at least then you already know the person is interested in a romantic relationship with you.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-He could provide resources (e.g. books, articles, online courses, etc.) on how to have successful romantic relationships.
-He could create forums or social media groups where people could ask questions and share advice on romantic relationships.
-He could provide workshops on how to have successful romantic relationships.
-He could provide counselling services for people who are struggling in their romantic relationships.
