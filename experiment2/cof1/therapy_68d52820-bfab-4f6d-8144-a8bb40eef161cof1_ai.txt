Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I feel like I just keep annoying my therapist
Even though he has never given me any indication or reason to think this, I can't stop thinking I just annoy him. I feel like he's sick of me being whiny, and that all I do is complain, and that I'm being too "depressing". Which doesn't even make sense, because part of the reason I'm going is for depression... Of course I will come off that way if I am being honest about my feelings! 

I'm not doing great and he knows that, but not just how bad I am doing. I guess I am scared to tell him because I'm afraid he will think I'm basically being all of the above? And that I am making it up or something, because I find it really hard to show emotions in our meetings... 

Anyways, if anyone has any advice or similar experiences, I would appreciate any thoughts! How did you get past this? Thanks :)
