Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Is this a stupid reason to want to get help?
I have been considering therapy to help me deal with a break up, but I feel like that's a pathetic reason. Nearly everyone has to deal with a break up at some point, and they don't need therapy to deal with it. 

But I have been feeling awful constantly. I've had multiple breakdowns, one today right in front of my mother (part of why I'm seeking advice). I've been having severe anxiety whenever I'm in a situation where I may have to see her, and when I do see her an anxiety attack hits me like a truck and I have to turn and leave ASAP. I actually considered suicide, stupid as it sounds, and nearly went through with it once. 

I hate who I've become because of this. I feel pathetic for not being able to move on and be okay. I am young (18 years) and I know that break ups happen. It's a part of life, but it's killing me. It's been six months and it hasn't gotten much easier. Not a day goes by where she doesn't come to mind. I'm not searching for reasons to think of her, that's just where my mind wanders. 

It's probably just because I'm young, but I was absolutely head over heels in love with this girl. She was everything to me. First person I wanted to see when I woke up, last person I wanted to see falling asleep. Just seeing her face would make me smile like an idiot. All the little things she'd do gave me butterflies every single time. No matter how awful my day was, holding her in my arms and hearing her voice would make every problem melt away because she just had that power. The only thing that mattered in those moments was her, me, us. 

She fell asleep on me one day, and looking at her, calm, relaxed, and safe, that was the moment I knew for a fact I was in love with her. That I would do anything to make sure she was happy, that she wouldn't have to worry or be scared of the future. And now that she doesn't want me, I can't make that feeling disappear, and it's tearing me apart.

Sorry for starting to ramble, I just needed to get some thoughts out. It feels like a dumb reason to go to a therapist about, but I don't know what to do anymore.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-It sounds like you're going through a really tough time. I'm here for you, whatever you need.
-It's okay to be sad and to feel pain after a break-up.
-It's natural to miss the person you were in a relationship with, especially if you were very close.
-It sounds like you're really struggling. Why don't you consider therapy? It can be really helpful in managing difficult emotions.
-I'm so sorry you're going through this. If you ever need to talk, I'm here for you.
