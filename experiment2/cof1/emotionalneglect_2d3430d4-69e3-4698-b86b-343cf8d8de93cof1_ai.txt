Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I'm keeping track of how I feel around my close friend.
We've been missing each other's calls. An important conversation was put on hold cause she hasn't listened to my vns yet. We're both busy now with uni and work. 

We're on a call now and I'm body doubling her while she works while I'm lying in bed. 

I don't feel the greatest and I feel I do the same with her (that maybe I'm not a good friend either). Maybe this friendship is running its course. 

I don't feel like I wanna ask her things or make a lot of conversation like I used to because I feel drained when I do that. Maybe i dont have the best intentions either and maybe this is another sign. 

I feel like I want this friendship to fade.

And for the first time in a while I don't care to question how I feel or what my gut feeling is trying to tell me.


.... Could this be another time where the neglected part of me wants to escape? And I'm actually in a great friendship?

Does my gut feeling mean anything at all?

(I just derailed again in the last two questions)

[edit: I am realising that I might have been mistaking certain feelings for feelings of closeness. That I don't feel much of the things a best friend is supposed to feel for another best friend, I just will myself to. ]

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- If the AI detects that one of the friends is feeling neglected or drained, it could algorithmically generate conversations or tasks to keep the friendship strong.
- If the AI detects that one of the friends is feeling less close to the other, it could algorithmically generate conversations or tasks to promote closeness.
- If the AI detects that one of the friends is feeling like they want the friendship to end, it could algorithmically generate conversations or tasks to keep the friendship going.
