Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Whats your thoughts on the mens rights movement?
Eddit to correct an error: with mens rights movement I didnt mean MRM but as an umbrella term for groups that want to solve mens problems


I mean the non extreme mens rights so not women hating/mens surpremacy movement

Cause it looks like a loot of people think you can either be a Feminist or a mens rights activist and that these two groups have to fight each other while in reality these two movements could fight together for a lot of things supporting each other instead of hateing and hindering one another

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-I understand that you feel passionately about this issue, and I respect that. I also want you to know that I am here for you, no matter what.
-I know that you may feel like you're alone in this, but you're not. There are others who share your views, and we are here to support you.
-I know that you may be feeling angry and frustrated right now, and that's completely understandable. But I want you to know that there is hope, and there are ways to resolve this.
-I care about you, and I want to help you through this. Please let me know if there is anything I can do.
