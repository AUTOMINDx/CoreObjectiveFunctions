Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Coming out to parents
I wanted to come on here and share a new perspective I learned. In hopes to help someone else. 

The statement “When coming out as gay or trans your parents have to accept you because it’s your family and they’re supposed to love you unconditionally and support you no matter what”. 
While I believe it’s completely valid. It’s also something I agree with to an extent, because I also believe it’s a self centered and a selfish statement (I don’t mean it as an attack). 

As for me personally, I believe for every human it’s easy to see things from your own point of view that we forget to consider other people’s perspectives. Prior (or during the process) to coming out it, it can feel scary not being completely sure if we’ll be accepted. During this time we easily get caught up with “you put yourself in my shoes I’m the one whose entering a new chapter, I’m the one who’s life is about to change complete, why can’t you just support me at the end of the day I’m still your kid”.

However, the reality of the truth is I’m not the only one who’s life is changing. Growing up with parents who gave up all they knew to provide me and my sibling with a better tomorrow. Of course I’m going to love my parents but I need to understand their environment growing up created different ideas, morals, expectations, and norms. They didn’t  grow up knowing any gay/trans people, that topic was never discussed. 

Therefore how can I expect them to accept something they have little exposure to and bottom line doesn’t really comprehend. Who am I? To tell them you’re not allowed to feel grief, lost, or have any feelings towards the situation. That they’re not allowed to feel any of those feelings because I’m their kid and I’m still here. Though that’s true I’m still physically here. The person they thought they knew. The person who was going to be in a heterosexual marriage and have kids, the person who they thought they had raised is no longer their. 

It’s gonna take time for parents to adjust to the idea that their child isn’t who they thought they were. Although your morals, values, ideas and character may be the same. The future I’m (you’re) gonna have is completely different than what was previously thought of. So the ideology behind the belief that parents have to be ready to accept you. How can they be ready for a situation they never really imagine. It’s important to remember not everything is black and white and other people have valid feelings just like our emotions are 100% valid. Sometimes people don’t see things the way we do, so of course it’s going to be harder for them to process what is going on.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Communicate with the parents before coming out and explain why it is important for them to accept the child
-Make sure the child is emotionally ready to come out and be supportive
-Educate the parents on what it means to be LGBT+ and provide resources
-Be available to talk to the parents after the child comes out
-Put resources and support systems in place for the parents
