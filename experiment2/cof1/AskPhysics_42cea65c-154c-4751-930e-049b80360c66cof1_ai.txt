Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

From Engineering to Physics
Let me start by saying I am a 40-year-old with a Chemical Eng degree and a masters in data analytics, working in a data field, but I have always been interested in studying physics more formally, since I started doing it as a hobby.

What would be the best route for someone with my background to get into the physics world? A masters? Or must I start with undergraduate?.

I have a lot of the math and basic concepts from my undergrad and grad studies, and I have been getting into the deeper stuff informally for a while now, but I am very attracted towards focusing more time and maybe a career in something that really fulfills me, as theoretical physics does.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Offer scholarships or grants to encourage people with backgrounds in mathematics and data analytics to pursue degrees in physics.
- Offer classes or tutorials on physics for people with backgrounds in mathematics and data analytics.
- Create online forums or communities where people with backgrounds in mathematics and data analytics can discuss physics and ask questions.
