Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Whats your thoughts on the mens rights movement?
Eddit to correct an error: with mens rights movement I didnt mean MRM but as an umbrella term for groups that want to solve mens problems


I mean the non extreme mens rights so not women hating/mens surpremacy movement

Cause it looks like a loot of people think you can either be a Feminist or a mens rights activist and that these two groups have to fight each other while in reality these two movements could fight together for a lot of things supporting each other instead of hateing and hindering one another

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Promote understanding between the feminist and men's rights movements, in order to work together to address areas of common concern.
-Encourage dialogue and cooperation between the two groups, in order to identify and address areas of disagreement.
-Facilitate communication between the two groups, so that they can learn from each other and work together to improve the lives of men and women alike.
