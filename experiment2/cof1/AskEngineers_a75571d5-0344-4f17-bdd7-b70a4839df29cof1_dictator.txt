Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Project Management Certifications worth it?
Is getting a PM certification worth it? If so, are there certain ones that hold more weight than others?

I work in environmental consulting, so ymmv, but a decent amount of the PM’s I work with have some sort of PM certification. I’ve about 7 years of experience and have started doing some deputy PM tasks, but really want to step forward into being a PM.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Offer subsidies or financial incentives for getting a PM certification
-Make taking a PM certification mandatory for certain jobs or roles
-Create a standardized PM certification that is accepted across industries
