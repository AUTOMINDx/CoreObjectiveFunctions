Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Non-academic STEM jobs for theoretical physicists!
It seems positive to me how experimental physicists would be useful outside of academia, namely working as engineers, lab-techs, devs, or something else technical and hands-on. Similarly ‏‏‎ the computational side of theoretical physics seems useful in data science, which is pretty ubiquitous in STEM and finance. Are there other STEM-style jobs in which the skills of theoretical physicists are useful? Is mathematical modelling in high demand? Thanks.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Create campaigns or programs that promote the value of theoretical physics in other fields and industries.
-Work with businesses and other organizations to create job opportunities for theoretical physicists in other fields.
-Provide funding and resources for theoretical physicists to learn new skills that are in high demand in other fields.
-Encourage theoretical physicists to start their own businesses or work on self-employment projects.
