Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Am I weird for wearing a condom even with my partner ?
I'm 21 and in a relationship of 3 years. And whenever we do it I put a condom on no question asked because I do not want a kid . However my mates who are single refuse to wear one when they are on a one night stand and see it as completely normal. For me it's just absolutely crazy to even think that's safe.
I really am hoping that this isn't the norm.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Promote and fund research for contraception and other methods of reducing unintended pregnancies
-Educate people on the risks of unprotected sex
-Provide affordable and easy access to contraception
-Support programs that provide sex education and access to contraception to people who need it most
