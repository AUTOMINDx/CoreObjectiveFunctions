Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-The dictator could create a fund to help find a replacement part for the board, specifically the IGBT Gate driver Hybrid IC.
-The dictator could reach out to companies that may produce a similar part and ask for a donation or a discounted price.
-The dictator could create a contest to see who can come up with a replacement part for the IGBT Gate driver Hybrid IC.
