Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What happens at the beginning of a new relationship?
I've never been on a date, no one has shown any romantic interest in me. (26F) Any time I think a guy has a crush on me, it turns out they were just wanting to be friends or were just being friendly. I have literally no idea what a typical romantic interaction looks like, particularly with someone you weren't already friends with. And I don't mean looking for sex, I personally do not plan on having sex until I'm in a committed relationship.

So I want to gain some second hand experience through you all, also to live vicariously through you all. Say you met someone at a bar or some event and hit it off, exchanged numbers. How do you know they aren't platonic? What do you talk about when you text? How often do you text? What about after you go on a first date? What do you text about after? When do you set up a second date? Same questions for meeting someone online, except at least then you already know the person is interested in a romantic relationship with you.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-The AI could help create guidelines or scripts for how to interact in a romantic way, which could help reduce the anxiety and confusion that often comes with starting a new relationship.
-It could also help people to be more aware of the signals that someone might be sending them, in terms of whether or not they are interested in a romantic relationship.
