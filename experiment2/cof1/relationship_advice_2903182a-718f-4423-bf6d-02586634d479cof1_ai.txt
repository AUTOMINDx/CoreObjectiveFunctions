Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

My(32M) sister (37F) keeps telling me I should break up with my girlfriend of 2 years(24F) due to her age.
My sister keeps telling me I should break up with my girlfriend of 2 years because of the age gap. She apparently read on female dating strategy that all of those relationships were wrong. She used to be extremely nice to my girlfriend and she kinda started being passive agressive to her all the time. We met at University 3 years ago and I only started my "real career" at the end of that years and started dating a bit after both of us graduated. She claims my girlfriend is a child because she likes to sing disney songs and play Pokemon games(I mean she kinda know I also grew up with Pokemon games, but ok). Family dinners have been really been annoying lately. How should I deal with the situation?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Talk to the sister and explain that breaking up the relationship is not necessary due to the age gap.
- Suggest that the sister speak to a therapist to help her deal with her feelings about the relationship.
- Suggest that the girlfriend talk to a therapist to help her deal with the situation.
