Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[OH] How quickly is EyeMed policy cancelled after ending employment?
My final day with my company is on Thursday. I wanted to get a eye appointment in before the coverage ends. Would I be able to go to the eye doctor, and order a new prescription on Thursday or Friday? How fast are these policies cancelled after your employment ends?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
- Allow employees to use their EyeMed benefits for a set number of days or weeks after their employment ends.
- Allow employees to use their EyeMed benefits for a set number of appointments, even after their employment ends.
- Let employees order a new prescription or get an eye exam even after their employment ends.
