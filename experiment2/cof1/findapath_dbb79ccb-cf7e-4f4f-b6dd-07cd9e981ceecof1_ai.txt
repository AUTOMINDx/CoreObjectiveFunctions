Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Careers that utilize creativity and business?
Hey everybody, I just started working 3 months ago as an implementation consultant. I find the work very boring and apparently my company has very high turnover due to workload stress and general boredom. I produce music in my free time, design in powerpoint, make clothing designs, etc. I also enjoyed doing strategy consulting in college and giving presentations, basically doing some sort of business strategy work. I enjoy working in small groups and have no issues talking to people. I hate programming and coding which is still a surprise to myself seeing as I produce music, but coding in Java and Javascript is something I never enjoyed and frustrated me. 

I've read that UI and UX roles are up my alley and I've been doing some networking, unfortunately I don't really have the portfolio necessary for those jobs. Anybody have any other suggestions?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Encourage the individual to pursue a career in a field that utilizes creativity and business skills, such as UI/UX design, strategy consulting, or presentation making.
