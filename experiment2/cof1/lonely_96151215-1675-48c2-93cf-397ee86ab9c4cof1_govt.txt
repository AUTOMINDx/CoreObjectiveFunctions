Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Life feels stuck
I (27M) have been extremely lonely the past few months and I'm not sure how to go about getting out of it. All of my friends are married with kids so I don't have anyone to really hang out with these days so I end up doing everything alone and don't ever really have anyone to just chat with either. As far as relationships go, I would say I'm fairly decent looking though there could always be room for improvement but it seems lately I have had zero luck with dating apps or even just getting attention from women. I usually never had a problem getting into relationships in the past so I'm not sure what went wrong honestly lol. I find it kinda hard to meet new people these days since I quit going to bars. I really want to start a family of my own and get married but I'm just not sure if that's even in the cards for me anymore

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Create or support programs that help connect people with similar interests, provide opportunities for socializing, and help people meet new people.
-Provide information and resources on healthy relationships and dating.
-Launch campaigns or initiatives to encourage people to get involved in their communities and to socialize in more informal settings.
-Increase funding for mental health services and support programs.
