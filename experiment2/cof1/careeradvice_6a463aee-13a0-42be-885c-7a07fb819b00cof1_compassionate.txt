- "It sounds like you are feeling a lot of pressure to make a decision. Can I help you take some time to think it through?"
- "Both of those courses sound like they would be interesting and challenging. I'm sure you would learn a lot and be successful whichever one you choose."
- "I know it can be scary making a change like this, but I have faith in you and I know you can do it."
