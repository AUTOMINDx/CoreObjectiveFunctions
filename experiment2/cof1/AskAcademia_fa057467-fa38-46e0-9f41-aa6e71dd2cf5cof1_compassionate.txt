Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Anyone here not have a reference from their supervisor upon graduating?
I'm  at the tail end of 4 years into my PhD (in a field where 6.5 years is  the norm), and the last 2 years have been very unproductive from my end.  Not so unproductive that my committee has had an issue (I've never had a  bad committee meeting) but bad enough that my supervisor has raised  concerns multiple times.

A  combination of mental health problems (depression, suicide attempt),  lack of support network, and of course, COVID, eventually eventually  lead to my supervisor suggesting I master out since November last year. I  felt that was drastic, and opted to take a short leave of  absence...which did WONDERS for my mental health but my productivity is  still not up to my supervisor's standards (e.g. he's been asking for  some figures for the last 3 months that I just...haven't gotten around  to).

I've also been focusing on a  lot of things to wrap up datasets and what not, and still maintain a  positive outlook, but the main issue is that before my leave of absence,  my supervisor directly told me he would likely not write me a reference  upon graduation.

I still want to  do my PhD, not for academia but because a lot of jobs I want require PhD  level experience (plus I'm 4 years in and I like my project!), but has  anyone had success with not having a reference?

I should add, I made the huge, huge mistake of opening up to my  supervisor about some of my mental health issues (just the lighter,  depression related stuff) -- huge mistake.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "Let's brainstorm some solutions."
- "I'm so sorry that you're going through all of this."
- "I'm here for you, whatever you need."
- "I know it's hard, but you're doing a great job."
- "It's okay to be frustrated/angry/sad."
- "I believe in you."
- "Thank you for being so honest with me."
- "We'll get through this together."
