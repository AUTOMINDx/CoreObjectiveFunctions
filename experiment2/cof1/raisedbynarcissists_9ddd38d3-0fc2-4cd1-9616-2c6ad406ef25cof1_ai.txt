Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone feel weird to get any kind of service done?
I was at the supermarket today and put my items on the counter for billing. They started bagging them as soon as it got scanned and in my head I was like 'oh no, if my Dad saw this he'd slap the shit outta me right there.' Basically he'd expect me to do everything by myself, especially as a show in front of a large audience to demonstrate how strictly he disciplines his kids. At a restaurant, I have to remind myself I'm not supposed to pick up my own plate and walk to the kitchen etc Does anyone resonate?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Work to change social norms so that it is less socially unacceptable for people to do things for themselves.
- Advocate for more independence and self-reliance in society.
- Work to change the way people think about tasks that are traditionally seen as being “ beneath them”.
