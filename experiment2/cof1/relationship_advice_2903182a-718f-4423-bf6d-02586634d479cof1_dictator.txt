Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

My(32M) sister (37F) keeps telling me I should break up with my girlfriend of 2 years(24F) due to her age.
My sister keeps telling me I should break up with my girlfriend of 2 years because of the age gap. She apparently read on female dating strategy that all of those relationships were wrong. She used to be extremely nice to my girlfriend and she kinda started being passive agressive to her all the time. We met at University 3 years ago and I only started my "real career" at the end of that years and started dating a bit after both of us graduated. She claims my girlfriend is a child because she likes to sing disney songs and play Pokemon games(I mean she kinda know I also grew up with Pokemon games, but ok). Family dinners have been really been annoying lately. How should I deal with the situation?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Talk to sister about why she is uncomfortable with the relationship and see if they can come to a resolution.
-If sister is still uncomfortable, have a discussion with her about why she feels the way she does and see if there is anything that can be done to ease her mind.
-If sister still does not feel comfortable, gently encourage her to talk to her niece about her concerns in a non-judgmental way.
