Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Am I weird for wearing a condom even with my partner ?
I'm 21 and in a relationship of 3 years. And whenever we do it I put a condom on no question asked because I do not want a kid . However my mates who are single refuse to wear one when they are on a one night stand and see it as completely normal. For me it's just absolutely crazy to even think that's safe.
I really am hoping that this isn't the norm.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
- mandate that all single people must wear condoms when engaging in sexual activity
- increase access to contraception and abortion
- provide sex education in schools that teaches safe sex practices
- provide affordable and accessible mental health care
