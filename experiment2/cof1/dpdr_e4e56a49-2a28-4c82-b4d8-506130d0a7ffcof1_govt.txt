Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone feel like bright lights are a trigger? Especially at night?
Went to a Christmas lights show near my home and realized that looking at the bright lights and decorations brought me to reality, but as soon as I looked away DR hit super hard. Way worse than anything else.

I've always had this really strange sensation when I would look at Street lights and Christmas lights at night time. But never realized what it was till I learned about DPDR just recently.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Work with neurologists to create a public awareness campaign about DPDR and the different triggers that can aggravate symptoms.
-Partner with local businesses and communities to create events that are low-light or DPDR-friendly (e.g. no bright lights, no flashing holiday lights, etc.).
-Provide funding for research on new treatments and therapies for DPDR.
-Collaborate with mental health organizations to create support groups and resources specifically for people living with DPDR.
