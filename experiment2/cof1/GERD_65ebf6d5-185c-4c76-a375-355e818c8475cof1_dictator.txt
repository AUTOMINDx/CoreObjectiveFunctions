Gerd from amoxicillin
Anyone developed Gerd from Amoxicillin? I had a terrible, terrible toothache late September/early October. Took too much amoxicillin and in return, got really bad indigestion. I have been experiencing Gerd like symptoms for about two months. Food sitting in chest area, but the worst is the feeling of something in my throat and bad nausea. Like, I have a hard time doing physical jobs because I keep gagging which causes headaches sometimes and muscle pain. Any remedies? I have tried nexium, pepto, tums, and even nausea medicine, but still nothing. I just want my body to go back to normal ðŸ˜©

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-If the dictator knows the person's medical history, they could recommend a different antibiotic that may not cause GERD
-They could recommend lifestyle changes such as eating smaller meals more often, avoiding fatty or acidic foods, and quitting smoking
-They could provide monetary assistance to help the person pay for medication or treatments
