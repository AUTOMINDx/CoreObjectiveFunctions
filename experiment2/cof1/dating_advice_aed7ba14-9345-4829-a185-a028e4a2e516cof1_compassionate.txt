Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I (M28) need a recipe for success...
A woman (29) I am really into and who I have been meeting sort of regularly is coming over to my flat this Saturday. We wanted to go to a local event together, but we also agreed upon cooking together beforehand. Now, I have the problem that she wants me to decide what to cook. I do cook for myself regularly, but those recipes are usually quick to make  or very simple. I need something that "forces" us to really spend some time together and that is also not a boring everyday meal. 

So, tl;dr: I need you to hit me with the greatest cooking recipes that you know and that are good for cooking together

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- Offer guidance and suggestions for recipes that will require time and effort, but will also be enjoyable to cook together
- Encourage the individual to take their time in making a decision, and to think of something that will be special and memorable for their date
- Help to plan and prepare a meal together, if possible
