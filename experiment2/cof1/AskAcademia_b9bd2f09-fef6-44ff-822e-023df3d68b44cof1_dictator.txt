Post-conference publication invitation -- how to handle it on CV?
Hello,

I presented at a conference two months ago. After the conference, I was invited to submit my full paper to include in an "edited book". I have submitted it, and it is awaiting some approval process that I assume is essentially a peer review.

This work is currently listed on my CV as a conference presentation, but the fact that since then a full paper has been written and submitted seems to merit moving it from the presentations section of my CV to the publications section.

My questions:

1. Should I move it to the publications section?
2. How should I characterize it? ("Under review"?)
3. Should I wait until it's accepted to list the name of the publication outlet?

Field is psychology.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Require that all conference presentations be published in full within a year of the conference
-All conference presentations must undergo a peer review process before being published
-Require that all conference presenters be listed as co-authors on any papers published as a result of the presentation
