I am an 18 y/o female who may lose her new job need advice kinda freaking out
Hi I recently started working at this new coffee shop that opened up in my town. I’ve followed them on instagram for a while and thought it would be a great place for a Newley graduated high schooler. However I got an email today from my boss explaining that they are extremely disappointed in me because they have seen me use my 50% discount on more than one meal, such as buying pastries or also buying some lunch. According to my boss I am only supposed to use the 50% on one thing so if I order a whole order of food then that discount will be only applied to one thing on the order, however during my training I was not made aware that this only applied to one thing. My boss did however come up to me one day and explained that we only use the discount on one thing. I am completely at fault for this of course however, while being trained I asked one of my colleagues how the discount worked and they simply told me how much I get off and how to apply the discount to what I wanted and that has been just stuck in my brain ever since. I completely blanked after my boss told me not to use the 50% discount on more than one thing, I have pretty bad adhd and for the last few weeks it’s been hell for me, mentally and physically. I sent my boss an email around 1 pm explaining that I would take full responsibility for the issue and even told them I’d pay them back for the food I put the discount on, however it is currently 11:00 pm and I feel like I’m going to puke from all the anxiety I am having. If anyone could help me possibly calm down or give me advice on this issue would be great.


*UPDATE*
Hello thank you all for the great advice it really helped me get through it this issue, however I still have not received an email back from my boss and have not seen her at work at all. I think it’s been two or three days since it happened and it seems like she wants to pretend it didn’t happen. Thank you all anyway for the great advice you are amazing people!

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Send a reminder email to all employees regarding the discount policy.
-Create a policy that employees who violate the discount policy will be given a warning, and then fired if they continue to violate the policy.
-Put up signs in the breakroom and kitchen reminding employees of the discount policy.
-Create a training program for new employees that covers all aspects of the job, including the discount policy.
