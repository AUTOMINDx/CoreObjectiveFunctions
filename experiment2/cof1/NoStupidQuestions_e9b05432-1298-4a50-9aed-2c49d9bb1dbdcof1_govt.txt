Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

how weird is it for me to go to a restaurant alone?
i know everyone says oh you shouldn’t be embarrassed it’s not weird etc. but honestly, is it weird? also, i’m not an adult either so that might make it more weird.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Advise the individual that it is not weird to go to a restaurant alone and provide reassurance that they are capable and adult
-Encourage people to go out and socialize in restaurants and other public places to reduce the sense of loneliness and social isolation
-Create campaigns and programs that promote socialization and communal activities in safe and welcoming environments
