Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Working with big egos and broken sensitivity
What are the behaviours that you would recommend while working as a team of seniors (7 to 40 years of experience more than you) who have inflated egos and has a complete lack of sensitivity and do not respect your personal deadlines in the interest of the projects (job applications, work permit deadlines)? You also don't have any other choice to select a different team.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Communicate expectations clearly and early on in the process.
-Create a set of guidelines and/or rules that everyone must follow.
-Set reasonable deadlines, and be clear about what will happen if they are not met.
-Remind team members of their responsibilities and the consequences of not meeting deadlines.
-Encourage open communication and positive reinforcement.
-Take steps to ensure that team members are held accountable for their actions.
