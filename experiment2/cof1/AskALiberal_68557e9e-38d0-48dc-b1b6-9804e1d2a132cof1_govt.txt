What do you think about Medicare Advantage plans?
Lately I've been bombarded by commercials for advantage plans so I looked into it. I guess the idea is the federal governments gives a private company the money to provide health insurance to a Medicare beneficiary. From there the private company gives beneficiaries all sorts of additional benefits that original Medicare doesn't give: dental, hearing, vision, prescriptions, etc.
