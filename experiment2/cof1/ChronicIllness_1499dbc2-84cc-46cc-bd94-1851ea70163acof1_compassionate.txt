I am FUMING. Especially after reading that bullshit '90%+' quote. Tempted to go off in the comments...


Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Try to understand the person's perspective and show compassion
-Address the person's feelings and offer support
-Ask the person if they would like to talk about what is making them angry or frustrated
-Make suggestions for how the person could cope with their feelings
