Relation between morality and self interest
Hello,

Can someone help me by giving me suggestions what is the relation between morality and self interest? (we were asked to find different relations and we choose one of them and try to back it up with examples)

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Promote altruism and compassion-Encourage people to think about the well-being of others-Provide education on ethics and morality-Promote veganism/vegetarianism to reduce animal suffering-Support charities that work to reduce suffering
