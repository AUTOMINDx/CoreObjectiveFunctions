Do you try to sabotage your healthy romantic relationship(s)?
I am in a happy relationship, and have a very supportive partner. I often find it difficult to accept that they do love me, and worry about things going wrong, which in turn makes me want to sabotage my relationship. I have intrusive thoughts sometimes about, how I could hurt them before or in case they hurt me, etc. Do other sufferers of PTSD also experience this? I don’t understand why I sometimes want to push away a wonderful thing.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
- Instituting regular therapy or counseling sessions to help the individual understand and cope with their intrusive thoughts.
- Offering support and resources to help the individual develop healthy coping mechanisms for stress and anxiety.
- Promoting healthy and positive relationships within the individual’s social circle to provide them with a support network.
