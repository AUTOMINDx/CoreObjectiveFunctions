Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I wrecked my own life
2 years ago during a prolonged bpd/manic depressive episode I made some choices that equivocated to me taking a sledge hammer to my life. I lost my job and my family will not see me anymore. I won't excuse what I did cause I know it was wrong. But now I just feel so alone. I have always been fairly quiet and struggled with social conneciton but I had a few friends at work and some family I loved. Its been 2 years and I have no clue how to pick myself back up. I have one friend left but even she is getting more distant and I don't know why. I miss my family so much, and they won't even let me try to reach out to them. Everything just feels numb and dull. I loose track of time because everyday feels the same. I'm just scared that if things don't change then I'll just give it all up.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Work with the friend to create a support system, helping to connect the friend with resources and other people that can provide support.
-Reach out to the family and try to establish a reconnection, potentially working with a therapist to help mediate the reconnection.
-Encourage the individual to seek out therapy and treatment for their bipolar disorder and depression.
