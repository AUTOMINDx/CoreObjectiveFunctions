What's the difference between a clinical social worker and a therapist?
I found out that my therapist  is actually a clinical social worker. What's the difference between a social worker and a therapist?  Does one do/specialize things the other doesn't? 

I mean my social worker seems to be doing great at addressing my mental health issues. As of right now, things are going well, so I dont think in my case it doesn't matter too much. I was just curious. 

If you are wondering how I didn't know he was a social worker, I just asked my primary care physician to refer me to someone to adress my mental health issues and she did. I didn't really look up who it was.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Clinical social workers could be better educated on mental health issues and how to address them.
-There could be more resources available to clinical social workers to help them better serve their patients.
-Therapists could be better educated on mental health issues and how to address them.
-There could be more resources available to therapists to help them better serve their patients.
