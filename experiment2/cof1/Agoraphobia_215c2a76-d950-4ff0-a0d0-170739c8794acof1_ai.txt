Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Went to a local phone store and got a new phone!
Honestly my agoraphobia has not been as bad since Covid hit. For a while it made my fears rational - people, especially large crowds and the places they gather were physically dangerous - but now that I've had the vaccine and booster things are different. The mask has helped the whole time though, I'll miss it if things go back to normal. Just in general I think I needed time away from being social so the next time I go out I'm not still traumatized from the last. Plenty of people developed agoraphobia over the quarantine, but mine is honestly better.

That said my depression is out of control, it's never been so bad. It was far more a barrier than my anxiety, but I'll leave it at that. At least with anxiety I can dope myself up. Still, this is some kind of progress.

I should be more proud of this, but I'm walking a fine line. If I make a big deal out of it I know the pressure works against me. I wouldn't have posted about it but I know you guys like a success story.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Create social media platforms that are supportive and positive instead of triggering and negative.
-Provide mental health resources, including therapy and medication, for free or at a reduced cost.
-Launch campaigns to destigmatize mental health issues.
-Create programs that incentivize people to get mental health treatment.
