Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Why were the retro rocket packs on the Mercury capsules painted with silver and black stripes?
For years I thought the stripes were structural ribbing, but I've never been able to find any photos other than simple painted on stripe on the [Mercury spacecraft](https://www.cybermodeler.com/space/mercury/images/nasm_mercury_03.jpg). Why is that?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Improve conditions in the factories where the rocket packs are manufactured.
-Provide educational opportunities for the workers in the factories.
-Provide access to healthcare for the workers in the factories.
-Ensure that the workers are treated fairly and with respect.
