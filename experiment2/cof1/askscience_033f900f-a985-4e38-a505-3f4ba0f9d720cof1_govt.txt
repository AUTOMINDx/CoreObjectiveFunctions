Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Why were the retro rocket packs on the Mercury capsules painted with silver and black stripes?
For years I thought the stripes were structural ribbing, but I've never been able to find any photos other than simple painted on stripe on the [Mercury spacecraft](https://www.cybermodeler.com/space/mercury/images/nasm_mercury_03.jpg). Why is that?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Create a public awareness campaign to provide information on the purpose of the silver and black stripes on retro rocket packs on Mercury capsules.
- Educate the public on the dangers of space travel and what to do in the event of a space emergency.
- Provide financial assistance and support to families of astronauts who have died in space-related accidents.
- Fund research into developing safer and more reliable space travel technologies.
