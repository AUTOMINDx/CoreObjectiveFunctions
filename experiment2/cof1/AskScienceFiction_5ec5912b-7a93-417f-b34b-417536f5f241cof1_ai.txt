Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

[The Matrix] Since the human forces download their fighting skills from the same source, would every fight against each other result in a stalemate?
I recognize that Morpheus beat Neo at the beginning, but that was training. If two fighters of even strength fought one another shouldn’t it always end in a stalemate since they’d be at the exact same skill level?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Program all fighters with equal skills, so stalemates are more likely.
- Decrease the stakes of the fight, so that fighters are less likely to be injured or killed.
- Randomize the fighters’ skills and abilities before each fight, so that no one knows who is going to win ahead of time.
