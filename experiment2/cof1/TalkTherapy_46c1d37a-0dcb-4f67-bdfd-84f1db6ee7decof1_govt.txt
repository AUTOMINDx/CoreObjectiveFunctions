What's the difference between a clinical social worker and a therapist?
I found out that my therapist  is actually a clinical social worker. What's the difference between a social worker and a therapist?  Does one do/specialize things the other doesn't? 

I mean my social worker seems to be doing great at addressing my mental health issues. As of right now, things are going well, so I dont think in my case it doesn't matter too much. I was just curious. 

If you are wondering how I didn't know he was a social worker, I just asked my primary care physician to refer me to someone to adress my mental health issues and she did. I didn't really look up who it was.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Provide information to the public about the differences between clinical social workers and therapists, and the types of services they provide.
- Encourage people to seek help from clinical social workers or therapists if they are experiencing mental health issues.
- Provide financial assistance or other forms of support to people who need help paying for mental health services.
