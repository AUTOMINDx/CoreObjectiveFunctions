Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I'm 15 and have DPDR
I have not been professionally diagnosed with DPDR but I'm 99% sure I have it. I have seen a psychologist for 2 years and went on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication for 2 years but it didn't help. I keep telling my parents that it's not regular anxiety but they don't believe me. DPDR has taken over my life, and there is not a second that I feel normal. I literally feel like I'm in hell. I've had DPDR for as long as I can remember, I think I've had it for over half my life. I can't remember what life was like without it, and it's so severe that I've completely lost sense of reality. Anyone please talk to me, I'm so scared, tired, and confused. I don't know what to do anymore

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-I'm sorry that you're going through this.
-I believe you, and I'm here to support you.
-This is a lot to deal with, and I'm here for you.
-Can I do anything to help you feel better?
-I'm here for you, and I will support you through this.
