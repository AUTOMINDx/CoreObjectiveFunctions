Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Doing a chore your supposed to, but getting in trouble anyways, for doing it not when your parents expected you to, before they got home.
I just got scolded today, for not running the dishwasher when my parents wanted me to, despite me running the dishwasher 2 hours before my dad got home. I heard him complaining to my mom about it downstairs, when he got home, and I felt simply annoyed, and unappreciated, so I didn't take it seriously, and tried to ignore it, and go about the rest of my day. And then my dad calls me downstairs, asks me when I got my homework done, and then I said 1, and he told me that's when I could have put the dishes in the sink in the dishwasher, and ran it, instead of "waiting until the last minute". Which I didn't, because if I did, I would have ran the dishwasher an hour before he got back home, but I didn't. And in my defense, if my parents wanted the dishes to be put in the dishwasher, and the dishwasher to be ran when they wanted it to be, they wake up way earlier than I do. One of they could have literally done it themselves, instead of just using work as an excuse, to expect me to do it when they want me to, when I can't read minds, and I think they should be grateful, instead of mad at me over something little, and scolding me for it. I'm still pretty mad about it right now. Plus, if he was hungry after coming home from work, and wanted to get something to eat, there are plenty of dishes available in the kitchen, so I don't know what he was so pissed off about, and I don't think I did anything wrong, or anything to deserve getting scolded for. Christ, I fucking hate it here, and can't wait until I'm out of here. Fuck...!

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Communicate expectations clearly
-Create a chore schedule and post it in a visible location
-Provide clear instructions for chores
-Create a system where chores can be credited for allowance or privileges
-Provide occasional incentives for completing chores (e.g. special privileges or extra allowance)
-Remove one privilege for every two offenses
