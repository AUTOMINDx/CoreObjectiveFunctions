Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Does anyone feel like bright lights are a trigger? Especially at night?
Went to a Christmas lights show near my home and realized that looking at the bright lights and decorations brought me to reality, but as soon as I looked away DR hit super hard. Way worse than anything else.

I've always had this really strange sensation when I would look at Street lights and Christmas lights at night time. But never realized what it was till I learned about DPDR just recently.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Create awareness campaign about DPDR.
-Provide information on how to manage symptoms of DPDR.
-Create resources for those affected by DPDR.
-Offer support groups for those affected by DPDR.
