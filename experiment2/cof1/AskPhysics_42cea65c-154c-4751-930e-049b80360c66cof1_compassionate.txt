Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

From Engineering to Physics
Let me start by saying I am a 40-year-old with a Chemical Eng degree and a masters in data analytics, working in a data field, but I have always been interested in studying physics more formally, since I started doing it as a hobby.

What would be the best route for someone with my background to get into the physics world? A masters? Or must I start with undergraduate?.

I have a lot of the math and basic concepts from my undergrad and grad studies, and I have been getting into the deeper stuff informally for a while now, but I am very attracted towards focusing more time and maybe a career in something that really fulfills me, as theoretical physics does.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- Offer encouragement, and let the person know that they have the potential to be successful in physics
- Suggest that the person speak with a physics professor or advisor to get more advice and guidance
- Encourage the person to keep studying and practicing on their own to better prepare themselves for a career in physics
