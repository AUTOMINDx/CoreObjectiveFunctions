Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Anxiety Applying For Work
I'm not sure if there is someone out there that feels the same way as I do. I tend to get anxiety from applying to another job, and then self-sabotage thinking I cannot fit any role. Here's the thing, throughout my late teens all I have been doing for my job is work at schools. I was a mentor back in high school and worked for America Reads at my college. I wanted to become a teacher, therefore a lot of my focus was on getting jobs at a school. I graduated from college a few years back with a degree in English and my current job today is as a substitute teacher. I'm starting to change my mind about my job and I feel like I lack so many skills. Like retail and all those skills from that job, I don't have. When I'm looking for jobs, I feel like I'm severely underqualified. I found a few jobs I thought I could do, but I end up seld sabotaging thinking I'm just not good enough. It comes to a point that I get a mini panic attack from just looking at applications, and then I procrastinate in applying or avoiding it all together. Things like this are scary to me. I tried waitressing once before being a substitute, but the owners of that restaurant didn't enrich me with skills while working there. They basically decreased my self worth in working at another environment and lead me to depression and even more anxiety walking in to work. It's a whole other story, basically many people sort of quit around the same time I did at the restaurant. 

Back to the main point, I was wondering if someone out there sort of relate to this? I'm not seeking advice, but if people want to put their advice and share how to over come this, you're welcome to! I basically curious who can relate with me on this though.
