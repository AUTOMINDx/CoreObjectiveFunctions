Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

SELF DECLARED SOCIOPATH
I have been on a few dates with a guy...met him at the bar- he is coworkers with a friend. He is quiet- the type of guy to bring a book to a bar- I refer to him as "The Odd Duck" . 

We have been out a few times and he recently told me that he believes that he is a sociopath. That he has a hard time with empathy and compassion because he just doesn't relate to feelings very well or sometimes at all. When asked how does he know he likes me- his response was I want to help make your life easier, that's how I know. 

I don't know what to do from here. I know that when I heard sociopath I automatically wanted to judge and put distance between us. But in the experiences we've shared he is intellectual, funny, pensive, and nice....should I just cut and run? Or do I base staying on our interactions thus far?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "That sounds difficult for you to deal with. I'm here for you if you need to talk about it."
- "I don't know a lot about sociopathy, but I'm here to listen and learn if you want to talk about it."
- "I can't imagine how that feels, but I'm here for you."
- "Thank you for telling me. How do you feel about it?"
- "I know that this is hard to deal with, but I still want to be here for you."
