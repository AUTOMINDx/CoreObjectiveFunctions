Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Is it bad to tell someone in an interview that your life aspiration is to own your own business?
Sometimes when asked in an interview where I see myself in 5-10 years I want to say a business owner. 

But, I'm afraid that is not what they want to hear, or is it? What is your take?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Advise the person in the interview to be truthful, and explain that owning one's own business is a common life aspiration.
- Offer encouragement and advice on how to achieve this goal.
- Help the person develop a plan of action to achieve their goals.
