Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Was there an era where children weren't given names until after age 5?
This is a question my spouse and I have been discussing. They believe that children were never given names until 5 years old from the Victorian era and back. Everything I have researched, has shown that to be less common? I'm just looking for historical examples of names not being given to children and when it would've been prevalent? This has gotten me interested in the raising of children in historical ages. Thank you.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Perhaps conducting research on when it was most common for children not to be given names, and why.
- Working to create awareness of the benefits of naming children early on in their lives.
- Encouraging parents to give their children names early on, with the belief that it will help them thrive and grow.
