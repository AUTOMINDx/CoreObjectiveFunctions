Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Careers that utilize creativity and business?
Hey everybody, I just started working 3 months ago as an implementation consultant. I find the work very boring and apparently my company has very high turnover due to workload stress and general boredom. I produce music in my free time, design in powerpoint, make clothing designs, etc. I also enjoyed doing strategy consulting in college and giving presentations, basically doing some sort of business strategy work. I enjoy working in small groups and have no issues talking to people. I hate programming and coding which is still a surprise to myself seeing as I produce music, but coding in Java and Javascript is something I never enjoyed and frustrated me. 

I've read that UI and UX roles are up my alley and I've been doing some networking, unfortunately I don't really have the portfolio necessary for those jobs. Anybody have any other suggestions?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
- "I'm sorry that you're bored and unhappy with your job. I know that it can be frustrating when we don't enjoy what we do."
- "Have you thought about looking for other jobs in your field that might be more interesting or engaging for you?"
- "What things do you enjoy doing outside of work?"
- "It sounds like you're really talented and have a lot of interests. Have you ever considered starting your own business?"
- "I'll keep you in mind if I hear of any jobs or opportunities that might be a good fit for you."
