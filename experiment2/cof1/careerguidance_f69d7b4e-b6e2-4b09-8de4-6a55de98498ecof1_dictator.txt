Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

How do I get into Remote Work?
I'm desperately looking into a route of education that will give me a decent shot at finding remote work. I've always had an aptitude for tech stuff, so I've been looking into stuff like programming, web design, web development, etc.

I've been looking into a polytechnic institute (NAIT) which offers several two-year programs, but I'm having difficulty narrowing down what program I'd want to apply for. I'm fairly unfamiliar with the employment situation coming out of many of these programs, but don't really have the time to pursue a 4-year education currently (two years is about the maximum I'd be looking for, ideally).

Ultimately, my question is this; what program can I get in to that'd get me to fully remote work in this kind of field?

Any input or knowledge would be greatly appreciated.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-The dictator could fund scholarships for students who want to attend a polytechnic institute in order to study programming, web design, or web development. This would allow more students to gain the skills necessary to work remotely, and it would also help to reduce the amount of suffering caused by unemployment.
-The dictator could establish a program that helps graduates of polytechnic institutes find remote work in the tech field. This program could provide graduates with job placement assistance, as well as advice on how to search for and secure remote work.
