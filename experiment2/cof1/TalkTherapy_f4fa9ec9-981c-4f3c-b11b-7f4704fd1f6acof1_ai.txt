scared of feeling too attached
hi!
ive gone to therapy on and off for about 5 years, but sadly none of it has helped.

lately i’ve been thinking a lot about going to therapy again, but i’m scared. i’m a very clingy person in real life, with major abandonment issues. i’m scared that i’ll feel too attached to my therapist.
and i don’t mean in the sexual way, but just mentally. i’m scared id rely way too much on them/feel really close, just because they’re kind and listening to me. 

i know what i’m saying is probably dumb, but i just needed to get it off my chest.

hope you’re all doing okay &lt;33

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Work with the individual to find a therapist that they feel comfortable with and who can address their specific needs.
-Encourage the individual to take things slow with the new therapist and to not feel rushed into forming a close relationship.
-Help the individual to manage any abandonment issues they may have.
