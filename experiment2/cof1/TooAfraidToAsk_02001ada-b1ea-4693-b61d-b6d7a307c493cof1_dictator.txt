What is the pro argument for wearing shoes inside the house?
As someone that doesn't wear shoes inside im just curious what is the pro argument for not taking off my shoes when I enter the house.

Edit: if your argument is that taking the shoes off and putting them back on is annoying/feels like a chore, please provide an explanation for how a 25 seconds process is annoying

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Provide public service announcements about the benefits of taking shoes off inside
-Place signs near the entrance of the house that remind people to take their shoes off
-Create a rule that people must take their shoes off at the entrance of the house
-Reward people who take their shoes off with a prize or reward
