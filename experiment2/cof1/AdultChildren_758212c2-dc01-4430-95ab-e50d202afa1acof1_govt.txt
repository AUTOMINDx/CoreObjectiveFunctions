Anxiety following multiple birthday calls
My birthday was the other day and my (NC; my choice) dad called me at work… three times… within fifteen minutes… to try and wish me a happy birthday. Thankfully we have a new phone system that shows caller ID. 

The first call came when I hadn’t yet arrived for the day. The second came the minute I got there and before I even had put my bag down. The third time, a senior office mate who knows what being an adult child is like all too well grabbed the phone and told him I’d called out for the day. That bought me time for the day, at least. We have not been back to work since the day this occurred. 

Some background: I went NC with dad a few years ago. It was a long time coming but he humiliated me at my wedding and that was the last time I saw him. I stopped taking calls, messages or texts soon after. Before doing so, I made it very clear that I needed space, and that I would let him know if and when I wanted to rekindle our relationship. We all know how that goes. 

I’m dreading returning to work tomorrow. I know I don’t have to take his calls, but I worry he’s going to call incessantly like he did the other day until he gets what he wants.He knows what he’s doing and I hate it. I already feel horrid about being NC even though I know I shouldn’t. I just hate how manipulative he is. Do I take the call? Keep it short and firm? Do I ignore and pray it doesn’t become an office issue if he is relentless and the calls become disruptive? F

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
- Establish clear policies on what is and is not permissible behavior for employees with respect to phone calls and contact with family members.
- If the behavior persists after initial written warning, then termination of employment may be necessary.
- Offer emotional support to the individual who is experiencing the anxiety. This could be in the form of therapy, counseling, or other forms of support.
