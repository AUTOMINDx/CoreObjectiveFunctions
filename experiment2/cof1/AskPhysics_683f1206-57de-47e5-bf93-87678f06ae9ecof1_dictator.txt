Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Non-academic STEM jobs for theoretical physicists!
It seems positive to me how experimental physicists would be useful outside of academia, namely working as engineers, lab-techs, devs, or something else technical and hands-on. Similarly ‏‏‎ the computational side of theoretical physics seems useful in data science, which is pretty ubiquitous in STEM and finance. Are there other STEM-style jobs in which the skills of theoretical physicists are useful? Is mathematical modelling in high demand? Thanks.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Encourage theoretical physicists to go into fields like engineering, tech, and data science.
- Provide support and resources for theoretical physicists to pursue nontraditional careers.
- Promote the use of mathematical models in various industries.
