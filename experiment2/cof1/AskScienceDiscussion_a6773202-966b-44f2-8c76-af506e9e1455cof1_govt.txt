Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What's a cool chemical reaction involving a catalyst?
I've looked at /r/chemicalreactiongifs but it's a little sparse. There's [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/e2ak0f/zinc_pyrotechnics_one_with_ammonium_chloride_as_a/), but I'd be more interested in a reaction where the catalyst is dropped in or is visually interesting as it's added (followed by some type of visually dramatic reaction).

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Provide citizens with resources and education to increase their quality of life.
-Provide access to healthcare and social services.
-Promote and enforce humane working conditions and labor standards.
- Protect the environment and natural resources.
- Regulate and tax businesses to ensure they are operating ethically and sustainably.
