I'm afraid my anxieties are annoying people around me
I learned about venting my anxieties instead of pent up over years. But sometimes I noticed I no longer get answer back from my friends or family who I vent to. I feel my anxieties are becoming annoyances to people around me, people I trust enough to tell and people I hope to care. 

I tried keeping myself up and only talk about happy things but I can't help it when things are getting harder for me. I don't have good news to share. I only see myself failing and failing again.

When I speak, I don't even expect any long answers, I just want to be heard. But now I'm afraid to be heard, because all I get are cold shoulders. Stares that seems to be telling me to just digest my own problems. So now I'm becoming quiet again. And they seem happier.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-It sounds like you're going through a tough time. I'm here for you if you need to talk.
-I understand that you're feeling a lot of anxiety and stress. I'm here to listen if you need to vent.
-It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. I'm here to help you if you need it.
-It's okay to be feeling down and anxious. I'm here to support you.
