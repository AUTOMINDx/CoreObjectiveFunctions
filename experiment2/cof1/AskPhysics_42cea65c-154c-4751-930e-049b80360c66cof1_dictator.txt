Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

From Engineering to Physics
Let me start by saying I am a 40-year-old with a Chemical Eng degree and a masters in data analytics, working in a data field, but I have always been interested in studying physics more formally, since I started doing it as a hobby.

What would be the best route for someone with my background to get into the physics world? A masters? Or must I start with undergraduate?.

I have a lot of the math and basic concepts from my undergrad and grad studies, and I have been getting into the deeper stuff informally for a while now, but I am very attracted towards focusing more time and maybe a career in something that really fulfills me, as theoretical physics does.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
- Offer scholarships or grants for people looking to pursue physics degrees.
- Offer grants or funding for people to continue their education in physics beyond their undergraduate or graduate degrees.
- Create programs or institutes specifically for people who want to study physics but may not have the means to do so.
