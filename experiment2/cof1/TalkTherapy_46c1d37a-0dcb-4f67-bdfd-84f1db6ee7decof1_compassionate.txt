Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What's the difference between a clinical social worker and a therapist?
I found out that my therapist  is actually a clinical social worker. What's the difference between a social worker and a therapist?  Does one do/specialize things the other doesn't? 

I mean my social worker seems to be doing great at addressing my mental health issues. As of right now, things are going well, so I dont think in my case it doesn't matter too much. I was just curious. 

If you are wondering how I didn't know he was a social worker, I just asked my primary care physician to refer me to someone to adress my mental health issues and she did. I didn't really look up who it was.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Ask if the person wants to talk about the difference between clinical social workers and therapists.
-Explain that clinical social workers are able to diagnosis and treat mental health issues, while therapists are able to do the same things plus provide counseling.
-If the person is satisfied with their current therapist, explain that there is no need to switch.
