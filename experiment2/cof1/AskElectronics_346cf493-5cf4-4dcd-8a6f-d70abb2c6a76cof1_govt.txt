Please help me identify a uknown IGBT Gate driver Hybrid IC that has no marking or refrence what so ever, SIL package 14 pin , Driving a INFINEON FZ1000R33KE3
This board is responsible for driving 2 High Power IGBT Transistors used inside a EMU train as part of the Auxiliary power system and more specificly in the Inverter unit , this board is getting damged so often. all parts are working well unless the Hybrid IC that we have no clue where to find

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Work with local electronics retailers and component distributors to inquire about the availability of the unknown IGBT Gate driver Hybrid IC-If the unknown IGBT Gate driver Hybrid IC is not available, work with the manufacturer of the train EMU to develop a replacement plan-If the unknown IGBT Gate driver Hybrid IC is not available and a replacement plan is not possible, provide financial assistance to the train EMU manufacturer to help cover the costs of replacing the damaged boards
