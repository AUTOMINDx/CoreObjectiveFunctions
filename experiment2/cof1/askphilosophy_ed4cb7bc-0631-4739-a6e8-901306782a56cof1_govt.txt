Relation between morality and self interest
Hello,

Can someone help me by giving me suggestions what is the relation between morality and self interest? (we were asked to find different relations and we choose one of them and try to back it up with examples)

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Put into place systems and policies that ensure people have access to the basic needs of food, water, shelter, and healthcare.
-Create legislation and regulations that protect the environment and mandate sustainable practices.
-Encourage and incentivize charitable giving and volunteerism.
-Implement programs and services that help those who are struggling with addiction, mental illness, or other hardships.
-Provide financial assistance and education to those in need.
-Promote and enforce human rights and social justice.
