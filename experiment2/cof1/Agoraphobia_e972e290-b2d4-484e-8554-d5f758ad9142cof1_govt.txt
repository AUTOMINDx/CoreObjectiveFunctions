Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Need to get my refill
And here we go. I can go out back and play, go to the store via car, go to my moms, but the THOUGHT of walking three minutes from my apartment to get my meds from the pharmacy is killing me. I'm tired of making my boyfriend pick them up for me every single month. Why does walking give me so much fckn anxiety?!?!?!?

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-A government could invest in public transportation, which would make it easier for people without cars to get to the pharmacy.
-A government could create incentives for pharmacies to open near residential areas.
-A government could fund research on medications that do not require a prescription, in order to make it easier for people who do not have time to see a doctor to get the medication they need.
