Life feels stuck
I (27M) have been extremely lonely the past few months and I'm not sure how to go about getting out of it. All of my friends are married with kids so I don't have anyone to really hang out with these days so I end up doing everything alone and don't ever really have anyone to just chat with either. As far as relationships go, I would say I'm fairly decent looking though there could always be room for improvement but it seems lately I have had zero luck with dating apps or even just getting attention from women. I usually never had a problem getting into relationships in the past so I'm not sure what went wrong honestly lol. I find it kinda hard to meet new people these days since I quit going to bars. I really want to start a family of my own and get married but I'm just not sure if that's even in the cards for me anymore

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Assist the individual in finding social activities to engage in that will help reduce loneliness. This could involve helping the person join social clubs, attending group meetups, or finding new friends through online platforms.
- Help the individual to date and find a partner. This could include providing advice on how to improve self-confidence and networking, and suggestions for dating websites or apps that may be more compatible with the person's interests.
