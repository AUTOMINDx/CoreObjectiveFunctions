I was wondering if the traditional gender roles of men would also be changed. Why canâ€™t men be accepted if they are not providers and protectors.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-"You're right, it seems unfair that traditional gender roles are so rigid. I hope we can all work together to change that."
-"It sounds like you don't feel accepted for who you are. I want you to know that I accept you and I'm here for you."
-"I'm sorry that happened. That must have been really tough."
-"Thank you for speaking up. We need more people like you who are willing to stand up for what's right."
