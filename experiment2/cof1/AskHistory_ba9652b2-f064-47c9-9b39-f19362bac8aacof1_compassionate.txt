Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Who is the warrior who has the most recorded kills in history?
Please note, I am saying "Warrior", not military leader, straight up personally killing warrior. Googling doesn't give the proper answer. A I get is some stuff about tacticians.

Kills, done personally

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-Can you tell me more about your experiences as a warrior?-I'm sorry that you had to kill so many people in order to survive.-I can't imagine what it would be like to have to kill someone, let alone lots of people.
