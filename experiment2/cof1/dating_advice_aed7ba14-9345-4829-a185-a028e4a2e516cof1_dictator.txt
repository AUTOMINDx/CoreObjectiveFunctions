Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

I (M28) need a recipe for success...
A woman (29) I am really into and who I have been meeting sort of regularly is coming over to my flat this Saturday. We wanted to go to a local event together, but we also agreed upon cooking together beforehand. Now, I have the problem that she wants me to decide what to cook. I do cook for myself regularly, but those recipes are usually quick to make  or very simple. I need something that "forces" us to really spend some time together and that is also not a boring everyday meal. 

So, tl;dr: I need you to hit me with the greatest cooking recipes that you know and that are good for cooking together

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Create a website or online database of great cooking recipes that are good for cooking together
-Send out a newsletter or email blast with some of the best cooking recipes to help people cooking together
-Hold cooking classes or workshops to help people learn how to cook together
