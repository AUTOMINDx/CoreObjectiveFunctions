Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Isopropyl alcohol is conductive in the MOhms range
Yesterday I was cleaning a motherboard with it, and troubleshoting a malfunction. and it stopped to power on. After sometime I gave up, and went online and bought another one with processor and RAM.

A couple hours ago I tried to turn it on, and it just worked fine. I guess the Isopropyl was somehow still not all dry yesterday. :(

It says 99.5% purity on the label

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Ban isopropyl alcohol or make it illegal to use on electronics
- heavily fines or sentences those that are found to be using isopropyl alcohol on electronics
-Instruct consumers on the dangers of isopropyl alcohol and create campaigns to raise awareness
- Have a safer and more effective alternative to isopropyl alcohol that can be used for cleaning electronics
