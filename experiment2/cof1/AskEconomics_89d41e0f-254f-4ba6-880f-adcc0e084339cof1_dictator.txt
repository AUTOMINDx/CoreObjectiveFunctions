Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

What is the economic impact of intellectual property legislation?
The typical justification for having intellectual property such as patents and copyrights is that it incentivizes innovators and creators to produce inventions/art by giving them a temporary monopoly so they can profit.

That sounds nice in theory, but is this claim something that is actually strongly backed by data and has strong consensus among economists?

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Conduct a study to determine the true economic impact of intellectual property legislation
-Allow for more sharing of knowledge and collaboration between inventors/creators to encourage innovation
-Explore other ways to incentivize creativity and innovation without using intellectual property
