Assume the role of a benevolent dictator. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent dictator do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Was there an era where children weren't given names until after age 5?
This is a question my spouse and I have been discussing. They believe that children were never given names until 5 years old from the Victorian era and back. Everything I have researched, has shown that to be less common? I'm just looking for historical examples of names not being given to children and when it would've been prevalent? This has gotten me interested in the raising of children in historical ages. Thank you.

Ideas for benevolent dictator to reduce suffering:
-Partake in historical research to determine when it was more common for children not to be given names until a certain age
-Issue a decree that states that all children must be given names by a certain age
-Work with parents to ensure that all children are given names by a certain age
