Dad has started his binge. Always around the 20th of each months
First. Thanks to all the people who helped me before and gave me amazing replies and related with me. 

My alcoholic dad since he was 13 is drinking non stop. Popping street pills. Hes causing shit. He likes to stir things and laughs when we all argue. Im so hurt. He was doing good after his 10th hospital stay of the year (one a month) he vomits so much blood my mother wakes up to his entire floor soaked and covered. Then he started again couple days ago. I hate text him when i feel hurt about it. I tell him i hate him and i hope he knows. I ask him if i should start too and will i feel good on the pills.  I try and tell my family to cut him off with me and they dont. I scream and shout AM I THE  ONLY SANE ONE HERE. They dont take his keys off him or his phone anymore. He drives drunk in his huge van and its icy here now.  He swerves allover the place. I phoned my brother and cried that  i hope he dies this time. So we can all be free. Ive put up with him for so long. What did i do to deserve him for a dad
