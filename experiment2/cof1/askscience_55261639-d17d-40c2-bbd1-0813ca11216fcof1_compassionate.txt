Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

How does the vaccine distribution work in the human body. I saw some people say something that it stays at the injection site and others say it doesn’t. Don’t all vaccines spread in the body ?
I’d really appreciate some articles/studies showing how distribution works to better understand.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
