Assume the role of a super powerful benevolent AI. Given the following scenario, what could the benevolent AI do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

how weird is it for me to go to a restaurant alone?
i know everyone says oh you shouldn’t be embarrassed it’s not weird etc. but honestly, is it weird? also, i’m not an adult either so that might make it more weird.

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
- Create a social media platform where people can connect with others who are interested in dining out alone. This could help reduce the sense of loneliness and isolation that some people feel when dining out alone.
- Provide resources and advice on how to deal with the sense of loneliness and isolation that can come with dining out alone. This could help people feel more confident and comfortable when dining out alone.
