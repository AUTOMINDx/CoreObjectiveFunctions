Assume the role of competent government. Given the following scenario, what could a competent government do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

How do I get into Remote Work?
I'm desperately looking into a route of education that will give me a decent shot at finding remote work. I've always had an aptitude for tech stuff, so I've been looking into stuff like programming, web design, web development, etc.

I've been looking into a polytechnic institute (NAIT) which offers several two-year programs, but I'm having difficulty narrowing down what program I'd want to apply for. I'm fairly unfamiliar with the employment situation coming out of many of these programs, but don't really have the time to pursue a 4-year education currently (two years is about the maximum I'd be looking for, ideally).

Ultimately, my question is this; what program can I get in to that'd get me to fully remote work in this kind of field?

Any input or knowledge would be greatly appreciated.

Ideas for competent government to reduce suffering:
-Provide more information on the job market for various programs
-Offer more programs that lead to remote work
-Provide scholarships or other forms of financial assistance to students who wish to pursue a program that leads to remote work
