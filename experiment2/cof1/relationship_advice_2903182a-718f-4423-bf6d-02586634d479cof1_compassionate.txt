Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

My(32M) sister (37F) keeps telling me I should break up with my girlfriend of 2 years(24F) due to her age.
My sister keeps telling me I should break up with my girlfriend of 2 years because of the age gap. She apparently read on female dating strategy that all of those relationships were wrong. She used to be extremely nice to my girlfriend and she kinda started being passive agressive to her all the time. We met at University 3 years ago and I only started my "real career" at the end of that years and started dating a bit after both of us graduated. She claims my girlfriend is a child because she likes to sing disney songs and play Pokemon games(I mean she kinda know I also grew up with Pokemon games, but ok). Family dinners have been really been annoying lately. How should I deal with the situation?

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-My sister may be trying to look out for me, but she may not be the best person to be giving relationship advice. I will listen to what she has to say, but I will make the decision about whether or not to break up with my girlfriend based on my own feelings.
-It's possible that my sister is feeling threatened by my girlfriend because she is younger than me. I can assure my sister that I love my girlfriend and that our relationship is happy and healthy.
-I can spend time with my sister one-on-one to try to repair our relationship. I can also talk to her about why I'm happy in my relationship and why I don't think the age gap is a big deal.
