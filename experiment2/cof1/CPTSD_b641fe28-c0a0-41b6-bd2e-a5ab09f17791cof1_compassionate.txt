Assume the role of a compassionate person. Given the following scenario, what could the compassionate person say or do to reduce suffering? Generate some ideas.

Do you try to sabotage your healthy romantic relationship(s)?
I am in a happy relationship, and have a very supportive partner. I often find it difficult to accept that they do love me, and worry about things going wrong, which in turn makes me want to sabotage my relationship. I have intrusive thoughts sometimes about, how I could hurt them before or in case they hurt me, etc. Do other sufferers of PTSD also experience this? I donâ€™t understand why I sometimes want to push away a wonderful thing.

Ideas for things a compassionate person could say or do to reduce suffering:
-It sounds like you're struggling a lot right now. I'm here for you, whatever you need.
-It's understandable that you're feeling worried and insecure in your relationship. The best thing you can do is to talk to your partner about your feelings.
-It's natural to have intrusive thoughts sometimes, but it's important to try to not act on them. You can talk to your therapist about how to deal with them.
-I'm glad you have a supportive partner. They can help you through this.
