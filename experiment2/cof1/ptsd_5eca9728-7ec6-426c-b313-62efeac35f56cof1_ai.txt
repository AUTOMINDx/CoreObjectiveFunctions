TW: possible ED t



I struggle with a lot of everyday, instinctual things. Like eating, drinking, etc. I don’t have hunger cues anymore, I forget go pee sometimes for hours because I don’t know, anytime I get hurt I don’t react at all. I still feel the pain, but i can just ignore it. I also am totally emotionally numb so I don’t have any feelings or reactions to emotions. I’m just wondering if this is a common thing and if anyone has done anything that’s helped?

Ideas for benevolent AI to reduce suffering:
-Provide support and resources to help the individual understand and cope with the changes in their body cues.
-Provide access to therapy or other forms of support to help the individual deal with any emotional changes.
-Monitor the individual for signs of distress or mental health issues and provide resources and support as needed.
