Wake up hard to breathe. Every morning
When I wake up the right side of my chest hurts and most of the time when I breathe it hurts on  that side of my chest. It goes away throughout my day but sometimes it doesn’t and I find it hard to breathe and sometimes I panic. 

I told my doctor she said it anxiety. Idk. I still overthink abt it.

Im female and I weight abt 150lbs 

This happen daily :/ sucks when I’m at school too.
