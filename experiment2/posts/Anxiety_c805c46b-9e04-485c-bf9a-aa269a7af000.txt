Feet paresthesia and dizziness 24/7
Hi Guys,

Your assistance please!

6 months ago and after a really stressful period,i woke up in the middle of the night with cold chills,shivering,slight sweating and a really strange burning sensation on my lower legs and feet.About 10 days later a constant 24/7 dizzy/rocking boat sensation was added to the symptoms.
For 6 months, the 24/7 dizzy/rocking boat feeling and feet paresthesia (hot/cold sensation) are still there while the quality of my sleep has been significantly deteriorated.
After almost every possible blood test,screening test (multiple MRI,dopplers etc.) and doctor visit, no pathology was revealed.
Most of the doctors advised that above symptoms are all related to stress which was even more increased after all these tests.
Has anybody else experienced these symptoms?
Could they be related to stress?
Your help will be much appreciated!

Thanks!
