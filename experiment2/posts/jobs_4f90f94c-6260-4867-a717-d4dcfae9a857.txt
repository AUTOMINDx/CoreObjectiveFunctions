Is it possible for me to get a job outside my state?
I live in California but I want to move to Texas asap.
The major problem is, I'm 29 and I have never had a job.
I sent about 20+ applications and had 2 interviews recently( for California, Yucca Valley) but no luck, infact in my first interview she asked me " Never worked before...so you just got out of highschool?" I reply with no, I'm 29. Then she dramatically rolled her eyes right Infront of me and scribbled down notes. Then dismissed me. Interview was less than 5 minutes long...
I also feel upset over the fact she never read my resume, which would have explained all of this or she was just being sarcastic.
The second interview was a bigger disaster...
Anyways, can someone without any experience land a job in a different state?
Currently I live with my ex and my 5 year old kid, been a stay at home dad. She would probably help me with the moving cost.
I do get SSi, but I want to work and get more real experience.
I'm tired of living off the government but I'm starting to feel like no one will give me a chance.
