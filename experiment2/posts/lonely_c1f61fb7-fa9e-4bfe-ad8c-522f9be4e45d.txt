24,I have never been hugged or held. Wish I had this.
I wish I had that intamacy, Im not bothered about sex (never done it) but the feeling of hugging someone and knowing you're safe, I bet that's the best feeling ever.

If only I got to experience that. I'm 24 now and not even had a hug, so I'm sure I'll never get to feel what it's like. I know I probably sound like a weirdo. But just that feeling of being wrapped in someone's arms, man I can't imagine how amazing it must feel... :( I guess I'll only ever be able to picture it instead of feel that.

Sorry for the post.
