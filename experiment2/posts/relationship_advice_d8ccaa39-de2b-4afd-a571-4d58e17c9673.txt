My friends basically called me unattractive in front of me. What should I do next?
I was out with a friend. I joked saying that it would be nice to have a buff boyfriend. She replied, "Yeah, you can! A lot of buff guys have girlfriends who aren't that pretty -"

This triggered a lot of memories. A couple of years ago, a friend (who I'm still in contact with) was telling me and a couple of her friends about her brother and how cute his friends are. I was like, "Makes sense. Attractive people, attractive friends."

Then she looked at us and went, "Then why don't I have any pretty friends?"

And there was one moment where I've made one self-deprecating joke in front of them and they just kept silent.

I know this sounds horrible and people reading this will feel bad for me. But rest assured, I've let everything out. I sobbed my eyes out for the last two days and I've been coming to terms with the fact that I'm not attractive. It's not the end of the world. 

But I'll like to know what should my next time be? Should I confront them? Tell them off then block them off everything?

One of them has a lot of family issues and clinically depressed. I don't think confronting her would be great for her mental health. The other one isn't someone that I've known long, tbh.
