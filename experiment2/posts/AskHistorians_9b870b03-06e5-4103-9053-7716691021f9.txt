Is there any larger subtext to the story that, only recently, did we learn Roman hairstyles weren't wigs but were done with needle and thread?
I recently discovered the story of Janet Stephens who is a lay-person who changed the field of Roman archaeology by showing lots of hairstyles were not in fact wigs but done with needle and thread: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet\_Stephens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Stephens)

I work as a journalist and am thinking of pitching this story to some places. I am curious if there is any larger subtext here, some reason that people got it wrong about wigs for so long that reveals larger information about the field of Roman archaeology. I'm just trying to find a way to situate this story into a larger story about the field.
