I need some help
I’m a 13 year old boy, and for around the past year, I’ve been really depressed. I am in therapy and I do have supportive family and friends, and I am very lucky in that way. School is one of my problems, as my parents say, “we all have things that we have to do everyday that we don’t like” while it is more than that for me. I have to deal with a terrible school, and I feel like I’m at my breaking point. Every night I say to myself, “I’m never going back there again” but the next day comes, and I keep on returning. It makes me feel like I have no control over my life, and makes me feel terrible. It makes me want an escape. Sometimes I take my knife, put it right up to my stomach, and tell myself to not be a chicken, and do it already. But I never can. In these moments I realize the value of life, but I feel like that value was wasted on me. Does anyone have any tips to help?
