When therapy doesn’t work
Today I had my first session with a new therapist, and it brightened my eyes to what therapy can be. 

I had always blamed myself for feeling lost and insecure after my sessions in the past (this is my 5th try looking for somebody) and had almost given up on therapy. I’m really glad I didn’t. This therapist helped me put my struggles into understandable words and made everything feel so much more clear. Even if it doesn’t work out, I know what to look forward to a little bit better. I had no idea what I was missing with my earlier attempts at finding a therapist. 

I guess I just didn’t know what ‘clicking’ meant until my session today. I thought you had to force it to make anything work…and I thought the hopelessness I felt was my fault! 

I just want everyone to know that if you feel hopeless about therapy, or getting help in general, you just haven’t found the right way for you, yet. I promise. It’s not because you’re too sick, and it’s not because you’re alone! You got this! There’s a way for you. I know how hard it is to keep searching, but it is honestly worth it! Take it from me.

If you agree say ‘Aye’!
