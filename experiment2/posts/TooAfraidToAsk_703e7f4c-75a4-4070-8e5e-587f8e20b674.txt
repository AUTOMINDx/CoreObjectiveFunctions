what do you think when you see someone with selfharm scars?
ive cut since i was 8 and im almost 16 now. so i have a lot of scars. i hate them and when i meet new people i always assume they're looking at the scars. I've had people tell me theyre ugly (i know u don't have to tell me), ive had people ask to touch them (pls dont do that??), and then I've had people just try to get me to tell them my whole life story. 

do you look down on people with sh scars? or are you like afraid to be near them bc they seem crazy? 
i feel like my scars pretty much dictate me and how people see me. 
would scars influence the way you saw a person?
