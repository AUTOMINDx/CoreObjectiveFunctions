I feel like I'm being held hostage in a shitty marriage, have less than the bare minimum to say that I have any quality of life, and that nobody is acknowledging how absolutely miserable I am.
Everybody's responses to me threatening to end my life completely fail to take into account that I get NOTHING in exchange for surviving. 

&gt;Think about how much you mean to your wife and daughter!
&gt;
&gt;What will happen if you go?

Fuck off. Do I exist only to satisfy their needs? What do I get for waking up every morning?

Yes, I'm on zoloft and vyvance. 

Yes, I'm seeing a therapist. 

Yes, I'm in DBT. 

No, I don't have the mental capacity to make long term goals, and even if I did set goals I honestly don't see myself getting even 10% of the way there because my adhd and depression and anxiety have completely destroyed my executive functioning.

I'm doing my best to avoid covid, but if I do get sick and end up hospitalized, I'm demanding a DNR.
