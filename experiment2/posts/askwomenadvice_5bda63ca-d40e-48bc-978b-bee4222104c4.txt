How to get rid of really rough feet? I have tried everything. The soaks, the creams, you name it.
I go get pedicures but no matter what..3/4 days after the pedicure, my feet are right back scaly. Lotion does not hold, oil dries up after an hour. I have banned any open heeled shoes from my wardrobe. I am very insecure about this. Even when I’m sleeping over with my guy friend, he never sees my feet. It’s such an embarrassing problem to have as a female. Any help is greatly appreciated.
