Friends reconnecting with my abuser TW SA
I went to high school with my best friend and my ex who manipulated me and SAed me. They were friends for a while until they had a falling out shortly before I dated my ex. She was angry at me the entire time I dated him because she didn't like that I would date someone she didn't like (for clarity, she was mad at him because he liked her for a while and when he confessed she turned him down so he didn't talk to her for a couple of weeks, which he later apologized for). She didn't know about how he was treating me. 

It's been 4 or 5 years now, she has graduated college and I'm about to, and she wants to reconnect with him for God knows why and is asking me to tell her whether it's a good idea or not, but I'm honestly really shocked and hurt that she would even want to. She has known all the details of the abuse and my PTSD for a year or two now. Even reading the texts from her updating me about his life and asking if she should contact him had sent me into panic attacks and left me afraid and unable to rest or enjoy myself. 

This isn't the first time she has done something like this either. We knew this kid in high school that bothered both of us with his insensitive/racist/sexist remarks. He started sexually harassing me, saying he was going to stalk me and getting way too close and stealing my stuff to blackmail me with. There was one time he even cornered me and climbed on top of me. I told her he was doing this and she dismissed it all saying he probably doesn't get enough attention at home. She then tried to befriend him because she wanted them to get along.

I really don't know what to say to her or what to do about the situation. I don't think it's fair to control her but I can't deal with this. Please help with any advice/thoughts you have.
