Is it normal for their name tag to say "social worker"?
I'm on my second therapist. I've probably had 10 sessions total. I've noticed that both therapists have had name tags that say Social Worker. I was expecting it to be Psychologist. Is this normal?

Anyway, I want to switch therapists again... Or quit. I feel all they do is ask "How are things lately?" and listen to me talk and then validate by paraphrasing what I said. I don't need validation, I need to speak to someone with wisdom, a profound mind, that will educate me on myself.

I don't learn anything from the sessions. I'm not gaining any insight, just validation, which I don't need. I want them to ask me questions and teach me about psychological stuff and why I am the way I am and dissect me. Interview me like you're Oprah. It's like they're afraid to delve into hard topics. I told her right away, I'm open to talk about any of my traumas but she doesn't ask me what they are.

Just asks how Ive been lately, then I end up talking about a casserole I made or the fact that I have a back ache, which is irrelevant.

Honestly I learn more from watching psychologists on YouTube.

Feeling frustrated. If this is what therapy is, then I won't make any further appointments.
