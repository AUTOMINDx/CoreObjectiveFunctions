Boyfriends Family Won’t Stop Talking Badly About Me
I (19F) have been living with my boyfriend (18M) for a year now. We’ve been together for two years and his family has done nothing but speak badly about me behind my back to everyone in the home (including my bf). It usually involves my “work ethic” though for a long time I was the only person in the house at all with a job, or things they want me to do around the house that I either already do or nobody ever mentions to me that I should be doing (cleaning other peoples mess) I never know what’s being said until weeks or months later when someone inevitably mentions it to me (bf doesn’t tell me because he doesn’t want me to cause a scene over it) and I don’t know what to do. We currently have nowhere else to go, he is still in school and we’re both working to get out of this house ASAP because his family in general is extremely toxic and does this to other members of the family as well. I left my family behind because of abuse and legal issues so we truly are stuck until we can afford to get out and he graduates, basically I’m just looking for advice in what I can do to stop this or make it easier until we can finally ditch them for good. 

TL:DR Boyfriend’s family is tormenting us with us having nowhere to go.
