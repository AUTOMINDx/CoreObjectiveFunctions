Career choice
Hey I am having a complexity choosing my career I admitted to medicine and got accepted for next year but I don’t really know if I want to enter medicine, my problem is that don’t what I like so I don’t what makes a good career for me . Is there any advice or something to make me stay in medicine or detour from it and if I detour how do I choose something else.
