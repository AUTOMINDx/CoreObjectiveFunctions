Kicking him out today
I had posted in another group asking was it ok that my boyfriend had spent the night and stayed over on thanksgiving until 1am at his baby mothers house.. he says its the kids.. i think its bullshit plus the messages and stuff i saw. Ive been dealing with underhanded stuff for the last year and a half and im over it. He wants to say he has no place to go but shouldnt he had thought abt tht before staying the night... he also feels like i should know what i got myself into bc he has a "family" im literally disgusted with myself and i need the push from everyone to let me know i can do this and i deserve better.
