[Contact] What technologies or advances arose from building the Machine?
After traveling through the Machine the extraterrestrial being explained that this was just one step in humanity reaching out, and that eventually they would take another.

It would seem like building and operating the Machine introduced some novel concepts, and though the government later disavowed the project, refuted the testimony of Ellie (and the other passengers if we are reading the book) and covered up the event as if it were a hoax, there were hints that they did take it serious if only in secret.

With that in mind what technology or advancements came about after the building of the Machine? How would it lead to the next step?
