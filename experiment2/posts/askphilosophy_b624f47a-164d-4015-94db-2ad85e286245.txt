Intersection of magic × art × technology: any literature on this?
Was just reading Heidegger on technology, and I really like his elaboration on the essence of technology as one of revealing. He draws a parallel from the Greek notion of teche, where the creation is not a manifacturing but one of coming out of concealment. I was wondering if there is any other literature that makes a similar point, but perhaps also on 'magic'? And maybe as magic as technology, or technology as magic? I don't know if this connection makes sense, but seems to me like there could be some threads. Let me know!
