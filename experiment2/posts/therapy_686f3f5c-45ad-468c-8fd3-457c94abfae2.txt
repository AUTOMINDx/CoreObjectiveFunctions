How do I tell my therapist I don't want to see her anymore?
I have been in therapy for about a year now, being treated with CBT for PTSD, depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I hate going to therapy, I dread it every week. I feel like journaling and spending more time on self-care would be much more beneficial for me at this point. However, I still deal with a lot of my problems so I can't just tell her I'm "better." It's just that every time I go to therapy, I end up feeling a lot worse afterwards and it causes me to focus on my problems. I am a high school senior with a 4.7 GPA and I am trying to maintain that so I need the extra time anyway.
