i think i have social anxiety, what do i do?
i’m pretty sure i have social anxiety and i don’t know what to do about it. i live in a constant fear of being perceived and judged by others. this feeling has held me back from so many things like making friends, seeking help in school…i’ve missed out on so many opportunities. it’s hard to focus in class because i constantly feel like everyone’s attention is on me for some reason and it makes me so anxious, so speaking up or asking for clarification is my worst nightmare. i just feel so uncomfortable around people. i can never just walk up to a person and start talking. i always sit in the back of the class to avoid people looking at me. i become hyper aware of all my actions, how i look, the way i talk... i overthink every small detail. i cant even hang out with my own housemates without feeling anxious like entire focus is on me and i’m being judged. i’m 21 now and ive felt this way my whole life and i wish my brain would just stop. i’m so scared to see someone about how i feel because a part of me feels like i’m not valid…what do i do?
