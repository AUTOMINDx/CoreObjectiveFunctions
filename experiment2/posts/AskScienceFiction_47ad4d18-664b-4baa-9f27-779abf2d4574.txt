[Teen Wolf MTV] How does the merging work between Ethan and Aiden ? can any twins do it ? only alapha twins ? is it a genetic quirk/mutation only they have ? also why do they take their shirts off but not the rest of their clothes ? how do their undies and pants fuse ?
And when they fuse are they a single person? or two minds in a single body?  is the merged being a bisexual  since they have opposite sexual orientations? Also they both killed the same alpha right? how are they sharing the  same alpha spark ?   is that only a twin thing ?
