Do we know to what extent men and women were affected differently by witch hunts?
I always thought that witch hunts victimized almost exclusively women. I just learned and was very surprised that a significant number of men were tried and executed as well. Now I'm wondering if we have any idea about the ratio of men and women who were tried, sentenced or executed (mainly in Europe) because of witch hunts.
