Has anyone gone no contact with their parents?
I’m in ACA and this is talked about but I am young and am struggling to justify my reasons for not wanting to be in contact with my parents. Well, I am struggling because I would want to be in contact but do not have it in me right now. I’m 100% on my own and am experiencing the guilt and shame of not being able to function in the dysfunction. My family triggers me so much.
