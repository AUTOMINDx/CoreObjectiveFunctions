Advice on Balancing Marriage and Family Circumstances
I've (24F) been together with my husband (24M) for the past 5 years and we've been LDR (long distance relationship) for the past year due to him advancing to higher education. I've recently accepted an offer to be transferred out to another plant of my company which would enable me to move out and live with him again.
A close relative recently passed over the weekend (non-COVID related) and due to some circumstances, we now need a caretaker for the home that they used to reside in. I have no siblings or other relatives able to do so. 
My husband is completely supportive of me staying here to tend to my family circumstances. My only reservations are that LDR has been really rocky this past year and my primary reason for accepting this job move was because we weren't sure if we could continue doing LDR for the rest of his schooling (3 more years). 
How do I process this situation? Should I consider cancelling my plans of switching jobs and moving out to take care of family and continue the LDR?
