Something to consider: sleep apnea
So I’ve discovered that my gerd is probably caused by sleep apnea. I’m not particularly overweight, but I was curious since im sleepy a good bit so got a sleep test. 


Had mild sleep apnea, I got the cpap. And when I wear it I wake up with no gerd, when I don’t wear it my gerd is back the next day when I wake up.
