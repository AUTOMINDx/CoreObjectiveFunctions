I’m too angry to stay in the same place anymore
I’m fucking done. My bullshit meter is overflowing and I’m too angry to be sad anymore.

I’m tired of these people and their stupid games.

I’m going to get a job. I have a 4 year college degree but I don’t care anymore. I’ll take whatever I can get because I need the money.

I have $20K to my name. I’m going to work one or two jobs, move out and live by myself.

I’m going to continue running my business on the side.

I’m going to live a life of peace with my doggo, my pet fish and all my plants.

I’m tired of participating in these peoples stupid games. I’m done with their ridiculousness.

It’s a stupid waste of time. I need to stop crying and just take care of myself.

Wish me luck on finding a job.
