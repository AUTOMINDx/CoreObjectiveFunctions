Do you have to be anti work to be a liberal?
I don't relate to these attitudes that all work is exploitive and should be abolished.  Does thinking that people should be able to work with dignity and be paid well for their labor make me a secret conservative?  I am currently going to college for a trade, that I really cant wiat to do, and the people in my classes want to be welders and actually  like what they do.  I honestly find this notion that all jobs should be automated to be frightening, because I can't help but feel like having a work ethic and wanting to work are good things that should be rewarded.
