I feel hated by ppl..
I'm agoraphobic and feel hated and mistreated by people. Not even my own parents or grandparents. I was never ever their favourite first.. the only 1 that truly loved me was my aunt.. but other than that I'm very hated by people and I want to die. I'm unemployment and still staying in this toxic relationship he says to me I havent worked for 4 years roasting me on pure heartache he knows that it hurts me very bad that I'm unemployed
