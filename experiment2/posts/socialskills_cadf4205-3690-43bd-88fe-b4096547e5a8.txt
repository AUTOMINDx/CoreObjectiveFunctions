why don't people wanna look me in the eye?
I've noticed this many times before in social situations , but today I was just left very confused. I had to do some group work with three other people and I was literally ignored almost the whole entire time. It wasn't just that, but almost none of them even looked me in the eye, not for once.  And the thing is, I tried to participate into the conversation but with no result. It's like they pretended like they didn't hear me and I felt so discouraged and even more anxious than before. When I asked a question, they just answered because they had to because it would just be too obvious. I noticed that they didn't look me in the eye and excluded me entirely from the conversation...it wasn't like I was being antisocial or anything, just normal and trying to participate the best I can while I felt immense anxiety. I tried to get eye contact with them, but I didn't get anything in return..because of it, I couldn't focus on the task and instead started overthinking everything I would say :( I feel so depressed, because I end up just feeling even worse about myself after interactions like that...
