Can we harness energy from atmospheric frequencies?
I got into an argument with a friend that’s claiming energy can be harvested from the atmosphere by huge amounts. He’s claiming an invention from an “engineer” claiming to have made an electro plasma generator that doesn’t run on Fuel or Batteries. Instead it is powered by the frequency waves from the space with emphasis of frequencies coming from satellites. Energy is harnessed through the principals of Tesla coils.

For now I’m calling complete BS because frequencies from the atmosphere is not strong enough to power things of that magnitude, especially this claimed “electro plasma generator”.

If you can understand the language [this is the video he saw](https://youtu.be/nU1Na3s52-8)
