Don’t Really Get It
I’m not sure where to go with this post. I guess I’m confused. I’m fairly attractive (I match with attractive girls on dating apps pretty often// I know not the best benchmark but it’s what I use), I have many friends that seem to enjoy my presence and stories when around them, and I’m an overall positive person. Yet first I feel like I only have one or two friends the actively seek to hangout with me. Maybe it’s the social media age and I should be grateful to have even two people seeking my friendship, but it just feels like very few people actually want to hangout with me. And second, I can never keep any girl that I’m interested in, interested in me. Whether it’s via matching on a dating app or meeting in real life I’m lucky to get longer than a day or two of texting. I’ve tried everything as well, immediately making moves, being more subtle, or just being friendly and trying to learn about the person. Nothing works though. Many times I notice I’m the one sending longer messages, am I showing too much interest that way? Ive waited a while to make a post like this but I’ve felt this way since around freshman year of high school about friends and sophomore year of college about girls and I’m not two years removed from graduating. (I had a gf from junior yr hs - freshman yr college so there wasn’t much worrying about friends then, but it was an extremely psychotic relationship with her controlling me a mass amount so maybe that’s part of my problem) What’s my problem? I know I overthink too much and I know there’s no way to actually know my problem. I guess I’m asking if other people have this problem and what they do to solve it? I’ve also toyed with maybe I’m just meant to be single. I enjoy my own presence but when I see a happy couple out it feels like a knife turning inside me.
