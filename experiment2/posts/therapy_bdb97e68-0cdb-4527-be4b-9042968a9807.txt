I think I'm Therapying Wrong
So I've been in an out of therapy since I was 12 for anxiety and depression among other things. I had quit going to therapy in 2016 because I felt like meds were just being thrown at me and nothing was getting " better". Doing cbt therapy hasn't helped me over the years. I struggle with some of the basic things , like a value worksheet or limiting negative thoughts, ect. Even that thing where they tell you just to imagine your feelings/thoughts as a cloud and let them pass. I don't know how to do that. When a thought crosses my mind it feels real. It feels like it is happening an I am helpless to stop it. 

I go to therapy but at this point I don't think I'm doing it right. I don't feel any better now than I did when I started. There are a lot of days I struggle to move forward. I am told by people "you have to want to get better". I do the homework' I participate in whatever assignment I'm given but I apparently give off the vibe, I don't want to get better. I am trying to hard an it is upsetting that is how I'm seen.  I am exhausted feeling like I do. I wish I was courageous enough to self check out but I'm scared. 

People tell me things are suppose to get better. But what is better? Am I Therapying all wrong?
