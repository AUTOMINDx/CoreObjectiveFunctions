Who is this philosopher?
I was reading w.k.c guthrie’s pre-socratic philosophers and came across this. “The search for a unity in the universe behind the multiplicity of phenomena is perennial and universal… In modern times we have seen a philosopher remark on the aesthetic appeal of unity and a logician describe it as the only thing which will satisfy the desire for explanation”. Any idea who this philosopher is?
