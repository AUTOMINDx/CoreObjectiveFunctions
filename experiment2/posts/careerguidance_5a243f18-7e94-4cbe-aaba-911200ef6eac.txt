At a crossroads what do I do?
So I want to go back to school. It's always embarrassed me that as smart as I used to be I never did finish college. My depression and toxic ex got the better of me and now I'm slowly crawling out of that hole. The problem is to compensate not having a degree. I had to make money somehow so I got a full time job, and then took on another when I heard friends of mine were understaffed (I advocate for workers getting treated fairly and support those looking out for themselves. But that though process gets cloudy when you're the one picking up the slack and working 80 hours a week)

 I work in an industry heavily impacted by covid (still is) and can't see myself leaving either job without screwing someone over. At the same time I know I need the jobs to pay off the debt I'm in and I can't see me doing that in time for school to start. Which will prolong the debt I'm in. Plus getting back into school has me anxious. Like really bad. What if I fail. What if I fall and ruin my life again. There's so much I need to do and so little time I need to get it done

But I CANNOT work customer service ever again. I cant stand people. I am good at what I do despite me hating it. I thought I would go into programming but I find myself procrastinating on it or getting stuck in development hell. 

So here's my questions.
 * How do I balance healthy boundaries with my job and school?
