WIBTA by aviding my parents ?
Im not the 'planned' child. My mum accidently had me when she was young. She got married with my step-dad when I was 1 year old and had another 3 kids (14F, 12F, 4F). Im (17F)  


Raising 4 girls are seriously expensive nowadays. Especially me, being a wedlock child, my parents had to pay for documents as I dont have any ID or any stuff like normal people do. So obviously, they had to spend lots of money plus my mum are a housewife and its my step-dad alne that works.   


It happend quite recently when I overheard my mum's conversation to my other 2 sisters (14F and 12F), I heard how she said she can't even ask my step dad some money to buy grocery as we are running out of it. I kinda felt bad because I know they do spend a lots of money on family inc. me.  


This my last year of school. I can't wait to get out and find some money to help my family ( although those are my step family mostly). I don't know whether I should persude my study or just work.   


But I can't stand feeling the feel of 'financially problem' especially my  3 sisters are 100% don't care of my parents' financial. All I wanted to do is cope myself in my room, study and avoid everyone so that I will now feel the bad feeling around everyone. I can still remember when my mum blammed me for everything that happend when I was little ( when I was 3 to 12 years old), saying I bring bad luck and I am the reason why she and my step dad have so much problems and how I always burden them with everything..   


WIBTA for wanting to avoid my family just until I get a job?
