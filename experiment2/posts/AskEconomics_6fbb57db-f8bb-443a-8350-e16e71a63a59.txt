Did Trump actually help or hurt the economy?
I've talked to a lot of people who are right wing who still support him because they say he helped the economy. Is this actually true? I heard that the federal reserve printed a lot more money during his presidency, devaluing the dollar.

Side question: why is inflation so high under biden?
