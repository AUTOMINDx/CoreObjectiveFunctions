Do you think novelists, like William Gaddis, can be used in philosophical research?
Hello there,

I am currently studying literature here in Czech and I will write about aforementioned author, William Gaddis. My bachelors thesis is going to be something along the line of "Development in critical reception of William Gaddis".

I told you this because it is almost a time I have to come up with the topic of my masters thesis, as I need to have the idea prepared before I apply for a programme in philosophy (as there are no master literature programmes nearby) 

So basically I will have written the first ever Czech written work about the man and I would love to continue to somewhat write about him in my masters as well, but the only option how to do so is to find some way how to merge the subject of William Gaddis and some philosophical question.

I did think about the epistemology of Gaddis, as he sure tried to stretch the human knowledge to its maximum, but I am unsure how to transform that into a valid question of my future research.

I am quite new in philosophy and I do need to read a lot more than I currently know, so maybe this is the problem aswell, but by the time I apply for my masters I will try my absolute best.

So, I do not want you to come up with the research for me, but I need to push in the right direction because as of now, there seems to be a wall inbetween philosophy and Gaddis for me, so I just need you, and beg you, to help me overcome it.
