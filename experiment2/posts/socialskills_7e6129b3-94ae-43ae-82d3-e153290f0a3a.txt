Going out of your room
Im 19, and I dont go out much.. and I have no problem with that. Im pretty content just being in my room all the time minding my own business and not bothering anyone. I go out when I feel like it which is not often cause I find going out exhausting. So i stay in my room.

But people that I live with seems to be bothered by this. Saying its unhealthy to be in my room all the time which I understand ofcourse. Although, going to work and university is enough socialising for me. And after work and uni i just want to have a wind down in my room, in my own space to recharge. 

People I live with wants me to live like them where they go out and socialise often. Is it so bad to be in my room all the time besides work and school? Do i really have to go out and socialise even tho I dont really want to? 

I'm very frustrated cause I cant seem to live in peace the way i want.
