Tonight made me realize that I needed the right person to unpack with.
Fuckless christ. That's all I've got to say. 

My therapist has spent the last month dealing with my shit, and waltzing me through the unpacking and healing process. As opposed to some gingerly topical pointing out super obvious shit. Dude's never been in any situation that I've ever been, however, knows exactly how to state normalcy to my feelings, and my coping mechanisms.

Fuck around if it doesn't feel somewhat validating to have just someone to just be comfortable with opening up to.
