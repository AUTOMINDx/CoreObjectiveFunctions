My previous employer denied me of work experience letter.
I graduated in 2020, worst year ever. After that, I interned at a firm for a few months and converted that into full time. The work environment was super toxic, I tried to resign but my manager rejected it and acted out of his whim. I later in Oct 2021, just quit. They denied me of the work experience letter. I currently am unemployed and have zero work experience practically. What should I do?
