Dad casually says he wants to torture animals
My dad is a sick man. Not even animals recieve mercy.

My neighbourhood has cats. Long fluffy cats. Not-so-fluffy cats.

These cats frequently visit his garden. Sometimes these cats get tossed into a conversation. He complains on how he doesn't like them being in the garden. He rambles on and on, never realising how dark the conversation is becoming. He talks about how he'd like to run over them and hear them meow for mercy. He also says how he'd like to do it infront of their owners if it wasn't for the rspca.

He acts as if the rspca is the problem. He acts as if its their fault for making animal abuse illegal.

This aren't the only animals he despises.  When my pet hamster died, he showed no 
remorse. I quickly decided to excuse his 
apathy; perhaps I had been overreacting. He  
 then stares at the pet's makeshift coffin, then 
 at my teary eyes. He then says, word for word
"Oh well we can get a dog now."
 I was 11.

I talked to my teacher about this. We had written a few notes to send off to some form of child protection service (my personal problems were also mentioned). 

I'm stuck on what to do. I don't know if verbal threats are enough to call the police over. I'm 99% sure that he won't actually harm them but I'm concerned on this man's mental health. I've called the police on his behaviour before. nothing really happened. 

Words don't hurt animals, but they do hurt children.
