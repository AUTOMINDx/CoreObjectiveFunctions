Handshaking/ masks for interview?
As the titles says I have an important interview coming up soonish. My state does not have a mask mandate I believe but what is everyone's opinion on this. Should I wear a mask? Should I shake the interviewers hand? Just don't want to blow this opportunity thanks in advance.

Edit: Thanks for advice got a written job offer from following what everyone said pretty happy to get off contract work now.
