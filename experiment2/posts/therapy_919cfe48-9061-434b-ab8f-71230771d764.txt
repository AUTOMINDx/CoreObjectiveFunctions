What is wrong with teenagers??
Im a guy, currently in high school. I’ve chose to change schools once because I couldn’t find any friends at my last school. Now I have the same problem at my new school as well.

The thing is, I suffer from a lot of social anxiety and I have a hard time getting to school. But what really makes it hard is the people that go there.

At my last school I felt completely ignored and frozen out of all conversations. People that I hanged around with at that school would literally make plans right in front of me that I wasn’t invited to.

Now at my new school, they are even more immature. This guy literally said today that all of the “boys” were invited this place, except for me. He’s also made statements before like you are the most boring person I’ve ever met and such.

Now I don’t put any weight to those statements because I know that they are wrong and that they don’t matter to me. The thing that gets to me is that I literally can’t make any friends?!

I don’t know if it is that I’ve been extremely unlucky with the classes I’ve been put into. Or if there’s some external signal that I’m sending out, making everybody want to avoid getting to know me?

I have good hygiene, I’ve been told I look good by several people, I have a bunch of hobbies and things I love talking about. I also try to be as mature as possible, and not judge anyone. I’m not perfect by any means, but I try my best to be nice and acceptable to be around. The only thing that I can come up with is that I’m not always at school, because of anxiety and also another chronic disease I have that make my stomach hurt.

So, is it just the world giving me a big middle finger wherever I go or do I bring this upon myself?? I really want to find friends at school, and I need help, I go to therapy every other week also to talk about my social anxiety. Do you have any advice, or have you ever been in a similar situation?
