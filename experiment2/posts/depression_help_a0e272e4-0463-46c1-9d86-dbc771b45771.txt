Dont know where to post this
How do u get over an ex that ghosted you? Its been like 3 months n me and him were only together for like 2 months but for some reason its been hard to move on our relationship was good and he was the one who wanted it and then just ghosted me with out a reason really.tbh I don't even know why I am still effected by it cuz he never even called me babe once and all we did was just go on night drives together a few times a week. Its getting in the way of my new relationship and making me over think like crazy And ik its holding me back. I still have not blocked him on facebook and I see his name pop up some times I guess I'm just hoping for that goodbye text that I know I will never get.... I just need advice on how to get over him and move on
