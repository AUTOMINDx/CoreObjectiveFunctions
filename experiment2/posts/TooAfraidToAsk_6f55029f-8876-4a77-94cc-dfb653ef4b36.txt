Why don't more modern cultures celebrate 'Day of the Dead' or similar holidays?
I had this thought after rewatching Kubo and the Two Strings and Coco (two amazing movies, please watch!). Both movies are set during their versions of a holiday celebrating and remembering their dead relatives and I wondered "why don't we have a holiday like this?" By that I mean America, UK, you get what I mean.

I suspect its to do with our modern day religions and society demonising death but I think that's wrong. Even at funerals I've always been like "it's should be a day of celebrating the person's life" of course grieve and all that, loosing someone is heartbreaking and traumatic to say the least, but I think if we stopped demonising death and celebrate similar holidays like Day of the Dead I think it would help a lot with us mentally because we wouldn't be so afraid of death.

I don't know, just a thought.
