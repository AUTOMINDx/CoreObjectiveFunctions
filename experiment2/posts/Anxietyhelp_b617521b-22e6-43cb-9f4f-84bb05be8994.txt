Help me.
I don’t know how to deal with my OCD. I one time tried to ignore my urges but only made me more anxious. I’m so sick and tired of dealing with it everyday. It’s the same thing everyday, “Do this, do that. When was the last time you did this or that? Do this a certain amount of times. What was the last thing (insert random thing here)?” My brain never satisfied and always tries to find someway to make me anxious. I can’t stand it!
