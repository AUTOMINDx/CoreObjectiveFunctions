Want to try edibles
Hi! So some background: I have anxiety and have been struggling with dp/dr for around 7 years. It wasn't triggered by a traumatic event; I have no core trauma to attribute it to. My therapist and I consider it a symptom of my anxiety and over thinking. My friend and I want to try edibles, but I'm wondering how it might affect my dp/dr. I've never tried weed in any form before. If I go into it as calm and relaxed as possible and do it with someone I trust, how likely am I to have a really bad trip that affects my dp/dr long-term? 
I know it's probably better to not do it just in case, but I've been wanting to try it for years and I'm sick of things like this holding me back from new experiences.
Edit: Thank you everyone for all your responses, I've decided not to try it at this time. Thanks!
