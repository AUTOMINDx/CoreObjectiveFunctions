What to wear to meet the family
I've been with my partner for 2 years, and haven't met his family yet due to Covid. I'm going to spend 2 weeks with them over the holidays and am kind of freaking out. They are upper-class and pretty conservative, very catholic...I grew up very working class, non-religious and I have no idea what I'm supposed to wear to things like xmas parties, nice restaurants and mass. My boyfriend is clueless I tried asking him what other girls wear to those types of things and he says he never really paid attention. I don't own anything fancy, so I need to go out to the thrift store and get some basics so that I'm not dressed inappropriately. What sort of basics should I look for? Also I'm 21 F.
