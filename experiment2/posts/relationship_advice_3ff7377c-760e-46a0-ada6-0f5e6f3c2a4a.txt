Philosophically, what separates a friendship from a relationship?
Beyond just what you do physically - in a vacuum, what defines that barrier between being friends and being in love?

I'm in a new relationship, and I'm trying to answer that question I keep asking myself.

I like my girlfriend, and I'm attracted to her physically, but I'm also attracted to millions of other women physically. I just want some perspective.
