Why am I always so exhausted and time doesn't last?
Today I had my breakfast, did a couple of calls, took a shower, did some laundry, made my lunch and now I'm trying to do some university work but I am already exhausted. It's 5 pm in the UK, it's dark at like 3 pm here and I just want to sleep already. Barely did anything...
