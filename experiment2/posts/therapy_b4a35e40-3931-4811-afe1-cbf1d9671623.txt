How do I initiate something I want to talk about but am too afraid to dip into?
im 27, f, lesbian. I've been seeing my new therapist since September. My last one wouldn't show up half the time to the telehealth meetings so I dropped her. My new one is very blunt and gets to the point and doesn't sugar coat anything (which I thouroughly enjoy!) because with my ADHD, i need someone to be a hardass. Otherwise, I don't take anything seriously.  


I gave her a list of 6 big topics I wanted to talk about eventually. The one I want to dive into the most is my ex GF. She was the first person I ever loved and she was the most toxic person throughout the relationship. it lasted about 9 months and ended because she said she needed to work on herself BY herself. Couple weeks later she started dating a coworker. They dated for about 3.5 years and broke up a few months ago I believe. I think her most recent ex is in the same boat I am about being the victim to how crappy she was treated.

Anyways, that relationship soiled alot of things for me. I will still have dreams and even nightmares about her. Everytime she comes up in my thoughts, I just want to do horrible things to her and sometimes myself. It's a really touchy topic and I know i trust my new T with anything. It's just the subject itself is just hard to talk about, and it probably always will be. She usually starts sessions with "where are we sarting today?" and I' love to be able to get the confidence to jump into that, but ughhhh it just chokes me every time i try to verbalize it. What would be a good way to bring it up? It's just hard to think of a way to do so...
