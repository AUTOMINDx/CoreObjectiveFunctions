creating potential scenarios in my head??
every single day, multiple times a day, I can’t help but create potential conversations/scenarios I might have with someone I interact with that day or even week. 

it is so overwhelming and exhausting. it can keep going for hours on end. sometimes I weirdly enjoy it? 

I’m not talking about physically feelings the effects of anxiety when thinking about these situations, although that definitely happens at times. I’m just curious about the concept of over analyzing possible situations and literally thinking about what response I and the other person would have in the conversation/argument. 

my potential scenarios lean more towards the negative side, but I imagine scenarios about everything. 

I talked to some friends, and most of them don’t suffer from this. do you guys experience this too? what is it like for you? is there a name for this?
