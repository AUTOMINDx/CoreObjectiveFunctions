How do I trust a therapist?
I know I have trust issues and many times I keep a facade to maneuver around people in my life. (Not close friends, but general population). Iâ€™m aware that a therapist would help tremendously, how do I start by being trustful enough to a therapist? 

I have tried one therapists before many years ago but I found that I was not willing to share my thoughts and life enough. How do I do it? What are some starting points?
