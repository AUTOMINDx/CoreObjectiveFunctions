Stay at current job or look around?
Hi everyone,
After some help with figuring out what to do.
I finished studying engineering at the beginning of the year, I was struggling to find a engineering entry level job so ended up working in a warehouse for 6 months (I started working there during the holidays part time).  A friend of mine managed to get me an internship at the small company he was working at.  I was offered an internship for 4 months.  I got a offer of employment but no contract, but apparently that is the way it is done in this company.  

My project ended up taking longer than initially expected and a couple of amendments were made to the offer, extending it a month at a time. After asking quite a few times about what my future at the company entailed (and him brushing me off) He then told me that he couldn't afford to keep me as there was other things in the business he wanted to focus on, which is fine I get that.  

The next week he tells me that he can keep me, he has come up with quite a few projects for me to do and he will get a contract to me soon.  I have been waiting for 2 months for this contract, I am still working on the initial project and kinda going insane and helping the other engineer, but am uncertain what to do.

He was doing reviews the last couple of weeks.  He told all of us to write things down that we wanted to improve, and what we could bring to this company.  All other employees had their review except me.  Then he comes to me on Thursday and tells me he has run out of time, he is away for the next wee while and that we can try do one over the phone at some point.

I am still on an intern rate, but don't want  to seem ungrateful to my friend who got me the job. They also have a workshop and all the tools that we are free to use, which is great.  But I am still concerned about the lack of contract.  Sorry for the rambling.  Is this normal in the industry? Any thoughts are appreciated.
