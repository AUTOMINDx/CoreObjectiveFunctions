I sat next to a narc. Got to ask her a question.
I went to a Christmas crafting class last night. And sat next to what seemd like a very nice person who happened to mention that she wanted to send a picture of what she was making to her grandson. But she didn't dare because the son's mom was mad at her. The mom told her that she had an abusive childhood and not wanting grandma to speak to the grandson. I of course was immediately put on alert but I tried to keep it casual and asked her if she ever thought she would be able to resolve the issue and reconcile with her daughter. She said "no" quite matter of fact and showed no confusion or remorse about the situation. No questioning her behavior at all or even saying that she regretted the situation. The only thing she said when she was describing it was that she asked her other daughter if she had been abused in her other daughter denied it. But I believe the daughter that called her abusive simply because grandma showed zero regret or remorse over the estrangement with her daughter and no effort or thought of fixing it at all. Not even real sadness. It was creepy. Edit : I have thought about this and it was like I said ". Don't bother picking up those pieces of glass just throw them away because that glass will never hold water again no matter how well we glue it back together.". That was the emotion she had in her voice it was a broken glass no big deal throw it away.
