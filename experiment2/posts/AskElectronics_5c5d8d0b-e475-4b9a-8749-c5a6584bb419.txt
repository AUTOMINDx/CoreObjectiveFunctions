Repair broken TV, blown capacitor
Hi. My friend's TV broke down. Something popped inside of it, and then it started smoking. They didn't want to repair it so they gave it to me. I opened it and found blown capacitor. Label on it is not readable and I didn't find online what values it could have.  
So, how would you suggest I could find the characteristic of this cap?  
And then, I red somewhere that this blown cap can be symptom of something else wrong on the board. Is it probable and should I replace something else?  
And what about the components that were above the blown cap? Should I replace them too?
