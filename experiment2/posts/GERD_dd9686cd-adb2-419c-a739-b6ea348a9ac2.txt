GERD-friendly garlic substitutes
Hi friends - Iâ€™ve been having GERD symptoms for a year now (HEAVY regurgitation) and am slowly working my way to managing it with all the lovely lifestyle and diet changes.  My only issue at this point is, I really REALLY miss garlic.  I am not just sensitive to it but also slightly allergic, and would love to hear what you all use to add flavor to dishes that normally would rely on garlic.
