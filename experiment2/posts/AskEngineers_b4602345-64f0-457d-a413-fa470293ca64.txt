What sort of technical interview questions can I expect as a Chemical Engineering new grad?
Hey everyone, title basically says it all. 

I have an interview next week at a fertilizer plant for a Process Engineering position. I completed an internship with them a year and a half ago and have been in contact with the man who does the hiring, but nothing is guaranteed and I refuse to walk into that interview anything less than over prepared. I have about 20 months of work experience total and am graduating next April. 

Anyone have some advice on the types of technical questions I can expect for a plant engineering position?
