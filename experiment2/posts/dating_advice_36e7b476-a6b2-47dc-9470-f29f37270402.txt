How to avoid hookup culture??
I’m 24F and thinking about dating again and I want to know the best ways to avoid guys just looking for a hookup?

I live in a place where there is a strong religious presence. I am not looking to date someone in this religion so it’s so hard to date a “normal” guy. They’re on one side or the other. Don’t get me wrong, I want to get funky just not right off. And in the past I just met guys who lied about their intentions.

What has worked for you and what are some signs to look for??
