do vegans eat honey?
I’ve heard pretty conflicting opinions on this. Some people say that it all boils down to how ethical the beekeeping is, but there are others that absolutely refuse to eat it because it’s an animal product, regardless of beekeeping ethics. 

So, is honey vegan? 

I know that some vegan standards have the “no animals or their products because they’re not willing” policy, but that tends to be weirdly flexible sometimes (e.g. people saying Kopi Luwak coffee is vegan because animals voluntarily take a shit and won’t care if you consume it, but other people say it’s not because the animals aren’t consenting to having their excrement taken).
