I can't believe I am gonna cry cause of loneliness .lol.
Sometimes I wish I had a brother or sister to talk to or just to feel someone's presence in this house . It feels like I live in an isolated prison cell. I need a pet lol . I can't afford one because I can't even support myself rn . I swear I will adopt a pet with my first salary . 

Fuckk even writing in this abyss feels so embarrassing, its like talking to teddy bear about your feelings , just a adult version of it .
