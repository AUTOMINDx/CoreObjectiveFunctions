Be honest with me, do virtual sessions suck?
I’m caught between a really good seeming therapist who only does phone calls and other options of in-person.. I’m used to seeing counsellors in person and feel like that setting is the only time I can be comfortable. Where I’m living is a pretty low-risk covid area so I’m cool with it. What do you guys think from your experiences? Pre or current pandemic!
