Starting an electrical apprenticeship at 25
Hi,

I moved from France to Sydney on my own 6 years ago (2015) as soon as I turned 18. I was working for an electrical company (and loved it) but never enrolled into Tafe as I wasn't a permanent resident back then. I am now soon to be an Australian citizen. 

I had a pretty bad car accident 4 years ago (2017), stopped working for a whole year and didn't want to get back into it. I've been working with dogs (looking after them ect) for 2/3 years. As much as I love the little shits and my customers, the money is okay but I work crazy hours (60+/week) and there isn't any room to grow really unless I start my own business. Electrical stuff, crawling under houses, onto roofs and getting myself dirty was what made me really happy. 

I have about 20k saved up and my partner (that I live with) is a freshly graduated lawyer. I am worried that I will struggle with the mature age wage (which is about $760/week for 38 hours but I'm not sure if that's after or before tax). I would be working overtime and week ends when/if possible of course but yeah. 

We were planning to buy a house together and get married in the next 5 years (before 30) but I'm afraid that won't be possible on such a low wage. 

Any advice or guidance would be highly appreciated. Thank you!
