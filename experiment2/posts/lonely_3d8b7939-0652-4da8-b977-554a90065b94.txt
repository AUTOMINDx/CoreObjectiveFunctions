I just haven't had physical affection and love for years, it just keeps getting worse
Nearly everyone i know irl sees me as a joke, and even when im in a relationship its just long distance and it just tears me apart being so love starved. Like whats the point, i never normally get to meet up with them and i just spend each day alone. I've never had a first kiss, or even held hands. And i know its going to stay that way for years to come. I just can't. Even my family doesn't give me much love, considering they hate the whole femboy thing.
