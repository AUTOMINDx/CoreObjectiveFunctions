DAE struggles with not becoming narcissistic/codependent?
I'm not really sure how to word this, but hope it makes some sense. From before my trauma was fully triggered, I was extremely disconnected from my feelings and picked up bunch of narcissistic/codependent traits. I've been making progress with my recovery, but I have changed countries and the new culture is triggering my old wounds. I just had a period of couple of months where I'd go back into my "old" self, shut down any emotions and became kind of narcissistic/codependent and mirror what I saw around me. 

I'm trying to build up my awareness and trying to be more in touch with what I'm feeling even if it's painful and be a healthy adult no matter how toxic other people are (or how I perceive them to be). But it's just seem like SO much work, and I get triggered all the time by everything. It seems like I need to be aware all the time and I'm exhausted. How do you not "give in" to the feeling of being shitty?
