No plans for future
I’m a 16 year old girl and I have no plans or goals for the future. Sure, I have a life ahead of me and it’s not the end of the world but I lack something my classmates have and that is dreams. I can’t imagine myself working in an office or having a stable career. I’m more capable of imagining myself working at a gas station or grocery store. I do not care for my future anymore and that part of me that was ambitious and willing to try has died some time ago so I no longer feel anything. It may sound dramatic or funny coming from a 16 year old but that’s just how it is. I come home from school everyday tired and upset wishing that all of this could just end for a while. When I told my mom that I’m upset she laughed it off saying that it’s normal and that I’m just whiny so looking for help from my parents isn’t the way to go. In conclusion I don’t care what happens to me. Nothing makes me happy anymore.
