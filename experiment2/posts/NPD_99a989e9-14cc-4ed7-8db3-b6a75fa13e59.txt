The Line Between Self-Confidence And Grandiosity
What exactly is the limit here?

If Chad's novel *Twilight of the Memes* wins the Nobel Prize for Literature, critics worldwide laud him as one of the greatest writers in the world, and so on...would it *really* be grandiose of Chad to declare himself one of the world's greatest writers?

If some Virgin wrote a mediocre novel that doesn't win kudos or barely sells, and that Virgin declares himself one of the world's greatest writers...that Virgin would be grandiose, unjustifiably so.

Even in some versions of the DSM it says that the sense of grandiosity is not commensurate with the person's achievements.
