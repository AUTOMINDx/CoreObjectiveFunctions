Engineering term or word for "doesn't scale well"?
I tried Googling this, but the results are wildly diverse and I haven't been able to find a specific answer to my question.

Backstory... I once watched a documentary about early flying machines where the writers made reference to a word or term I had never heard before. The topic was about how innovators of flying machines would create small, working versions of their aircraft and then proceed to build larger "man-sized" versions based on the successful smaller design. What they would discover (sometimes with fatal results) was that the larger versions failed spectacularly. As a design scaled the inventors failed to take into consideration the fact that key engineering factors (material tolerances, weights, pliability) would change as well. It took a while until people realized that small models don't scale well into their larger counterparts. 

There's an engineering word (or term) that encapsulates this "doesn't scale well" concept. Does anyone know what it is? Please?
