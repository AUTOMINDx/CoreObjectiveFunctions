When is it appropriate to ask someone to meet in person or to talk via voice/video chat on Tinder?
I've had this happen to me multiple times that I asked someone to talk via phone instead of chatting and they started ghosting me. I'm really terrible at conversing using the chat on Tinder especially when people have little to say about themselves in their bio. I always try my best to find small things in their pictures and bios to ask them about, but after some time I am reduced to asking kinda boring questions like, 'oh you like drawing, what sort of things do you usually draw' or 'is that your dog on that picture, what's her name' or even random silly things like what their favorite vegetable is.

Should I assume that if someone has little in their bio they are just looking for a hookup? Is it weird to ask them if they are just looking for a hookup or for a relationship?

I'm 18M and tend to get about one match per day if that's relevant.
