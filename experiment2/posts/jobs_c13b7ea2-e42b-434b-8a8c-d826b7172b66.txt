Employer won’t provide letter of termination
Not sure if this is the right sub, but I need some advice. 

I was let go from working in a private school in NC almost two weeks ago (the Friday before thanksgiving). 

I am not necessarily trying to argue the reasons for being released, although if presented they would probably not be seen  as “fireable worthy.” 

Anyway, I’ve been trying for the past week to receive an official letter of termination signed by my direct supervisor while I was working there. I have asked twice through email and have not received an answer either time. I was planning on applying for unemployment and looking for other jobs, so this document is necessary for me. 

What can I do from here now that they have ignored my request on two separate times? I don’t want to get a lawyer or take legal action if possible (due to time and money), but would be open to if I need to. 

Any help would be great!
