Is web3 going to change careers and recruitment?
Recently getting my toes in the water with web3 and DAOs, and thinking it could change radically job search and recruitment.  My thoughts are:

&amp;#x200B;

CV➡️  Proof of work

Interviews ➡️  Community participation and votes

Job search ➡️  Skill matching

Recruitment ➡️  Referrals

&amp;#x200B;

"I had no formal interviews, cover letters, or resumes to write. Hiring in Web3 is going down in DMs / Telegram / Discord. [@annikalewis](http://twitter.com/annikalewis)"

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think?
