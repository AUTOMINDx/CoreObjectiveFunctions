Friend who talks too loud and too much…do I tell them?
I have a friend we are both 24 and we have been friends for about 2 years and got along well but recently I noticed she talks a lot more than my mind can handle lately and also talks very loud. I also started noticing when we are around my other friends she has to talk the most or essentially be the only one saying everything. I also think I am noticing my other friends eyes drifting and very dead responses but I can’t tell if I’m just perceiving that…..

I don’t want to be a bad friend bc what if it is just me bc I honestly just don’t like loud sounds and I don’t want to make her feel insecure. But on the other hand I feel like as her pretty close friend I should tell her if she is being extra to watch out for her? Bc she is cool and I want my friends to like her too
