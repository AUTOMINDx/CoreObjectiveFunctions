[MCU] In episode 2 of Hawkeye, why did Clint and Kate save the “McGuffin?”
In the second episode of Hawkeye, the Tracksuit Mafia attack Kate Bishop’s apartment with Molotov cocktails, and Clint tells Kate they need to save the Ronin costume from the fire. My understanding is that Clint wants the costume only for the purpose of keeping people safe because if they wear it publicly they could be attacked by his old enemies, meanwhile Kate doesn’t seem particularly to care about it. 

So my question is, why didn’t they just let it burn up? Seems like the easiest way to solve Clint’s problem.
