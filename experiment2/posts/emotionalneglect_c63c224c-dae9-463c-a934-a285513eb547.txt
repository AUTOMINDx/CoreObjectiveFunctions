DAE have trouble feeling what others seem to feel during the holidays?
Maybe this is simply related to CEN's effect on my connection to my emotions, but I have great difficulty feeling the holiday spirit that others seem to feel this time of year. It's almost like any other time of the year for me. The only emotions that it conjures up for me are a sense of melancholy when I hear certain kinds of xmas music. I'm anti-religion and don't participate in that way, but have always liked the holidays. I always try to spend my holiday budget on charities but even giving doesn't make me feel anything. What's your experience like?
