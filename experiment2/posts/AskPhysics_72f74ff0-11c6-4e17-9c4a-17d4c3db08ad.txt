Virial theorum
So in a lecture I was deriving the virial Theroux however I’m confused on one step concerning evaluation [P•r,V] 

My working from the lectures is as follows

Now I completely understand up to the 2nd to last line (note x hat is an operator). But o don’t understand how one makes that jump from that to the final line. 

Can anyone offer any insight? Any help is greatly appreciated
