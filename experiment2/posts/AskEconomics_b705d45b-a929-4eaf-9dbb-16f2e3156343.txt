Can taxing capital be beneficial, and if so, what is the most effective way off doing so?
I saw this paper that explained that taxing capital could be good if the money goes towards innovation (at least that seemed like the gist of it) (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-019-09530-3). If this paper and conclusion is accurate (if not please explain!) how can we most effectively tax capital? Seeing as wealth taxes have a very high compliance cost and raise little revenue.
