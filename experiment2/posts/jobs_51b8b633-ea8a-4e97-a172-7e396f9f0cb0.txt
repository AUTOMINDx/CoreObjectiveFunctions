After quitting my job in 2019 and a harrowing 863 days of unemployment, I finally got a job.
I'm ecstatic. 

The job is nice (defending pension rights for people) and coworkers are nice too. Did I mention it's 1.5 mile away from my place? I work 4 days out of five (wednesdays off) and get paid 32k/y as a junior. Work hours are chill too, 8h30 - 16h or 9h - 16h30.

I've been living paycheck by paycheck, miserable for so long, no christmas, very frugal birthdays ...

I just want to tell you: I'm with you. There is hope. DM me if you need support.
