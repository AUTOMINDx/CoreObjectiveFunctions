SELF DECLARED SOCIOPATH
I have been on a few dates with a guy...met him at the bar- he is coworkers with a friend. He is quiet- the type of guy to bring a book to a bar- I refer to him as "The Odd Duck" . 

We have been out a few times and he recently told me that he believes that he is a sociopath. That he has a hard time with empathy and compassion because he just doesn't relate to feelings very well or sometimes at all. When asked how does he know he likes me- his response was I want to help make your life easier, that's how I know. 

I don't know what to do from here. I know that when I heard sociopath I automatically wanted to judge and put distance between us. But in the experiences we've shared he is intellectual, funny, pensive, and nice....should I just cut and run? Or do I base staying on our interactions thus far?
