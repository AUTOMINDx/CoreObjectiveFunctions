What is something you have done that has helped make your life better or happier?
My life is a bit pathetic right now... my boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me without much explanation, I have no friends and I'm alone. One thing that makes me happy is being with my three cats and cooking but I would like to get more forms of happiness. What makes you happy?
