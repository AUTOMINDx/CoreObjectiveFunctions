I'm drowning
I'm working more than my previous job and I'm paid a lot less with more expenses due to travel.

I have debt, a rent late and they ask me more without explaining why.

I made and still make bad choices thinking it's good ones, I'm impractical like that.

I'm struggling and can't rely on a SO to face it all together.

I'm tired and feeling like I'm drowning lately.

I'm crying.
