Am I weird for wearing a condom even with my partner ?
I'm 21 and in a relationship of 3 years. And whenever we do it I put a condom on no question asked because I do not want a kid . However my mates who are single refuse to wear one when they are on a one night stand and see it as completely normal. For me it's just absolutely crazy to even think that's safe.
I really am hoping that this isn't the norm.
