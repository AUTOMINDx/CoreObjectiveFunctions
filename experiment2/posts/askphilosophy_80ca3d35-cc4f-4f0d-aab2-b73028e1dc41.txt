Assuming Hedonic Adaptation/Hedonic treadmill is valid would it debunk utilitarianism
Hedonic Adaptation states that all humans are relatively at the same level of happiness despite experiencing pleasure and pain we all return to the same stable level of happiness. Almost like a ying-yang view on happiness. If this is true would there be any point in maximizing happiness since all humans have the same amount of mean happiness?
