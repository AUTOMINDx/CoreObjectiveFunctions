H1B Indian in US: thinking separating from wife, but am overwhelmed by idea of divorce and being alone. Please share experiences
7yr marriage, no kids, 36+ years and h1b we both. No family in US at all. Joint owner of house we live in.

How is life after divorce? I feel sensitive about leaving her behind, she came to US being arranged marriage to me. (She is brutal, combative, revengeful am losing my true self but I feel soft corner for her always). I am extremely scared about the prospect of being alone and never finding anyone or having kids. Also the explaining I would need to do to the friends and family and social circle. 

I rate myself introvert, with no great physical looks surely. Age is running out on us. I tend to feel dizzy even thinking abt divorce and have been putting this decision for 2-3years now. 

PS- Consulted therapist, have conclusion I should leave. My wife refuses to go for couple therapy. We have big fights bimonthly (at least).
