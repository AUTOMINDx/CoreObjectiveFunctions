Drugs worked
I've been on four other medications over the last 2 years for anxiety and depression.  None helped me. I got put on Zoloft and Abilify recently and within one week everything felt like 90% better. I still get sad, I still hate lots of things, and I'm still lazy but taking a shower and sending an email no longer takes all my energy for the day. Might be worth a try for some of you.
