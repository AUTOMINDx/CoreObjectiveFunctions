It Just Doesn’t Stop or Go Away
I don’t know what to do, I am trying my best to stay afloat but in the past few days I feel myself spiraling down hard. I had what I think was a panic attack yesterday, I can’t control my own thoughts or emotions. I literally am constantly on the brink of tears and I don’t even know why. 

I am on medication, I have gone to therapy, my parents and brother keep telling me they are worried about me but I don’t know what else I can do. They pressure me to change my medication, but they aren’t doctors so I don’t want to listen to them. But I really just don’t feel right.

My mind is like a steel trap, I remember every little detail to overthink or analyze. Thinking people don’t like me or I am annoying them. Each little phrase I have said and how it could have been taken wrong. 

It’s like a pinball machine where even if I manage to leave one thought I’m running full force into another one. Never stopping motion.

It doesn’t help that I’m nervous about my future. 

I don’t know what I’m doing about grad school, and everyone is pressuring me to know. Some people tell me to pull the brakes others to trudge on. I am running out of time to make a decision. 

I can’t manage social situations. I have a crush, and it literally is the most stressful thing since now my social anxiety just feels like 10 fold around them. All I feel is that I’m irritating, annoying them and being creepy. 

I can’t really talk about this with my friends in fear of overloading them, or my family since they don’t understand. 

I don’t know where to go or what to do because it just doesn’t stop.
