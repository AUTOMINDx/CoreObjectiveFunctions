Having a bad time this holiday season
I’m posting this here because I know you all will understand. I’ve run out of money and have to move back in with family. I can’t move in with either parent due to various circumstances, it’s not an option. I feel so abandoned by this.

The other problem is this means I would have to spend Christmas with these distant family members which I really don’t want to do. I don’t want to pretend it’s all okay and like I’m happy when I know they’re only including me because they’ll feel bad if I’m alone. I’d rather spend it alone.
