"It doesn't get easier, you just get stronger" is incomplete.
For a long time, I interpreted the quote as things must feel easier as we keep doing them, not because they get easier, but we get stronger, and I extrapolated every challenge we'll face.

This has caused me to stop many things in the middle cause, pushing ourselves will always be difficult. If we overcome one challenge, this doesn't mean that doing the same with another challenge will become easier. It will be just as hard as the previous one.

So I thing the complete quote should be, 

"It gets easier to do one difficult thing over time, cause you get stronger in doing it. But pushing ourselves over the next challenge will be as uncomfortable as the previous one"
