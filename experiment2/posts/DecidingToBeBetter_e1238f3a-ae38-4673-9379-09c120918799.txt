Dealing with thoughts of being too much.
Hey I was just wondering how people deal with the thought that they are too much or too damaged for friendships or intimate relationships. I.e. What they tell themselves or do when this becomes too much. I am finding it hard to move forward with friendships or dating because of past experiences holding me back and have found myself distancing from friends I do have.
