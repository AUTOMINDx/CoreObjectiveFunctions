[ALTERED CARBON] What are AI made from?
I apologize if this is a stupid question, I always thought they were holograms. But I got confused at some point where the AI actually picked up items. Items including a shotgun and the ability to shoot people with it.

The only thing I can think of is that they and the items are made from microscopic nanobots? Nanobots that are everywhere in the air around them? While a computer program assembles it into what it needs?

Please be kind, I love Sci-Fi, but that is only as far as my brain goes :D

PS: What a wonderfully well written show. An absolute refreshing experience. Will there be a season 3?
