I am lost
As you could read by the title, I feel lost. I joined a very well-known college here in my hometown, but since everything is online and frankly speaking I was extremely burnt out from high school (I did IB) and I have a bit of social anxiety, I didn't have any motivation to continue with my degree. I left college and now I am clueless as to what I should do about my future. It's been around 3 months since I left. I don't know which stream should I choose and I don't know if I should stay in my hometown or go abroad.
