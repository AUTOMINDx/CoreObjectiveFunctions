Need a friend?
Hey everyone! I’m in college and I’m finishing up this semester and I’m looking to make a few online friends to keep company during Christmas and stuff! Or if you celebrate any other holiday feel free to reach out too! I’m always open to learning other things! The holidays can be rough sometimes and it is okay to reach out for help! I am free all the time to text or even voice chat on discord!
Even if you don’t need a friend and you read this, I love you! You are awesome!
