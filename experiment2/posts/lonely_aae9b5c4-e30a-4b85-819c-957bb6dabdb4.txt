Ghosted Again.
I was ghosted by someone I've known for 3 1/2 years after I finally opened up. They were just an online friend but we spent so much time together gaming I thought I could talk to them. I hate being wrong about people. It just doesn't seem worth it anymore even bothering with anyone. What's the point if people just disappoint you?
