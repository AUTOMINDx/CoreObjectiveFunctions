Does black friday make the economy less efficient?
So I’ve been wondering how black friday – and days like it – influence the mechanisms of the economy (or perhaps the free market would be a better word to use).

I am by no means a econ major, but it seems to me that sales like black friday must impear the market as a mechanism for distributing goods by increasing profits for sellers, and such in the total picture disadvatage the buyers(who the markets task is to distribute goods to as efficently as possible)

So how is events like black friday seen to affect the market in distributing goods to consumers? Is it generally seen as creating inneficiencies in the market/economy, or does it in the end benefit the consumers by bettering the distribution of goods?
