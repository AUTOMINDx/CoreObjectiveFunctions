When do you decide to let go?
I’ve struggled with learning frontend development for about two years now; I’m currently learning reactjs but I don’t know if I have the luxury of time to persevere. I learned SQL and Microsoft power BI (my math skills are really great). Now I need some advice on whether to abandon frontend completely and focus on Data analysis. I’ve been out of a job for so long, I need to start earning to take care of my bills. Please help
