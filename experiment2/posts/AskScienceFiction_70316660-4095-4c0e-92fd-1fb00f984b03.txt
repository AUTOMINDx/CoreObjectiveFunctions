[Tolkein] It’s said that at the end of all things in Middle-Earth, Morgoth, Sauron and the Orcs will redeem themselves. Any idea on how exactly that’d be?
My best guess is that Illuvatar will just recycle them and use the energy to found the next universe or world. 
Apart from that, any ideas or hints about how they’d go about redeeming themselves?
