Wellbutrin 300mg first time‚Ä¶ freaking out
M24 175lbs 5‚Äô6 



Took 300mg on a whim last night (after being prescribed it years ago) with coffee and i havent slept since. I ran to work this morning on as little as 2 hours of shut eye. Im still not tired. I have no pleasure in doing anything, i dont want to talk to my coworkers, and i feel nauseated all the time. I dont feel my emotions. 

I took it 5pm yesterday‚Ä¶ how long until I can go back to feeling normal? What steps should I take to get back to my normal self? 

Sure, it helps me with my impulses and ADHD wanderings, but I am not having a good time right now and Im stuck at work feeling terrible. Please drop some knowledge on me, üôè thank you. 


This sucks realllly bad.
