My PTSD is making it impossible for me to have sex with my husband. I feel like I might as well give up and that I’m never going to be able to have sex again.
So about year and half ago I got triggered and it brought on PTSD symptoms, panic attacks, severe anxiety. I went to a counsellor and learned I have cPTSD I locked away all the memories of being molested from ages 6-11 when I was a child and had one other real bad experience in my early 20’s. I’m 32F and I tried having sex with my husband and I end up having severe panic attacks during sex. First time was just during for-play, second was after a couple penetrations I went into full on panic attack. My counsellor and Dr finally convinced me to get on meds after a year and half of me fighting it and trying to fix myself without meds. Well Now I’m on ssri and benzo’s I have absolutely no libido but at least before I actually wanted sex without the meds but either way would panic therefor still no sex. We want kids, I want to have sex with my husband. I can’t do any of those I feel hopeless and like giving up on life and just feel like dying. Does anyone relate or am I just a crazy person and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
