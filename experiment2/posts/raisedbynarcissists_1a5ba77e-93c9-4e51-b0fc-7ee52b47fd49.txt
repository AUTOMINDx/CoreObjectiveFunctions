DAE never “give in” or “back down”?
I was the golden child until I was about 8 years old. Starting when I was about 4, I remember my Nmom telling me that I was her favorite person in the world and that she loved me more than she loved my dad and my baby brother.

When I hit 9 or 10, I started to express an age-appropriate desire for privacy and independence. I quickly became the scapegoat and my brother the golden child.

Things got even worse as I hit adolescence and wanted even more independence. It culminated with me moving out at 12:00am on my 18th birthday and with a few regrettable exceptions, going NC for years.

I’ve been reading up more on how being raised by a narcissist affects me now into adulthood. But a common theme that I’m finding is that daughters of Nmoms often become people-pleasers, putting other their mother’s needs above their own, and take responsibility for her well-being.

I can totally see how that would be the dynamic, but that hasn’t been my experience and I’m hoping I’m not the only one?

From a young age, I refused to give into my mother’s narcissistic demands. She’d escalate the situation, so would I. It became a series of intense power struggles with neither of us backing down. At the time, I felt like if I gave in to her even once, I would become worthless - so I was fighting for myself. 

There’s a lot of talk of boundaries on this sub. Setting them, holding them, etc. but I’ve never had an issue with that. I’ve been setting and holding boundaries since I was a young teen. 

My trauma comes not from being walked over, but from constantly having to be on guard, and sometimes being emotionally abused and threatened in perfectly legal ways since I was a minor. I knew it was wrong and abuse all along, but I legally was powerless and she always reminded me of that.

Does anyone else share this experience?
