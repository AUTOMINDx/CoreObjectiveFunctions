How do I [24f] Get over a broken heart and THe Feeling That I have been used?
Long story short, I met a guy a year ago on Bumble who we called/chatted for HOURS. Reason we didn't meet IRL was because of long distance (hour away), he broke up with an ex 6 months prior to meeting me so i was wary, I was also busy with studying/career stuff at the time, and covid lockdowns was very bad. Him and I were very happy with our penpal type of relationship to start as friends which bloomed into lonnng and deeper conversations. 

Eventually sort of grew some feelings for him, but he had red flags i knew would get in the way of the idea of getting in relationship with him. He has expressed interest in dating me. However, I feel like I have been used over the year, and he's not over his ex. We finally met up a month ago several times and it's been the best times of my year seeing him. We even fooled around a bit. But I learned he was still attached to his ex (you can see my prior reddit post if you want the HUGE red flags and his close relationship with his ex). I didn't think he had clear boundaries with her as his friend. He also moved to a different province.

So I'm left feeling heart broken that I could never pursue him bc I'll always be second best to his ex. I'm trying to forget him, but it hurts. He tells me he really likes me, wants to date me, but i don't trust it. I feel used. I feel gross I did stuff with him too. With holidays coming around with feelings of family/friends/relationships, it hurts even more. How do I get over this?

TLDR: How do I get over the fact that I guy i knew for a year still seems to have no clear boundaries with his ex, despite him wanting to date me, but also having moved to a different province? how do i get over feelings of being used because that's how i feel.
