Panic attacks and fight or flight
Whenever my sister visits I know I’ll get panic attacks because she knows all my triggers and so does my brother. I try real hard not to overreact to their attitudes but it is impossible to control. I go into fight or flight mode real bad and it is scary. They did everything possible to remove me from Thanksgiving. My family yells at me whenever I get like this and it only gets worse. Then my sister always says that I need to be hospitalized and this only happens when she’s around. I go literally insane because she knows how to make me this way. My sister in law even shoved me the night before when no one was around and I did not engage but then no one believed me. My meltdown was because of all the pent up anger I had from all the mean things they did to me. My sister brainwashed my mom and my other sister into thinking that I’m insane. It shocks me, because she has a kid that has severe ADHD and she lets that kid get away with everything. I’m a lot younger than my siblings. Oh and my sister in law vandalized my car a few months ago. I never harm anyone! I always try to avoid them as much as possible.
