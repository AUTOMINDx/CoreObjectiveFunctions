Is there a circuit that is the equivalent of two female ethernet ports directly connected to each other?
I have a mini 3-port PoE switch and a PoE splitter that I would like to combine into as small a package as possible. Ideally, that would involve removing the female port on the splitter and one of the ports on the switch and wiring them directly together. As I understand it, I can’t do this because \**waves hands*\* “magnetics”. Is there possibly a circuit I could build a super tiny PCB of that would fix this? I’m not 100% sure where to begin my research on designing something like this.
