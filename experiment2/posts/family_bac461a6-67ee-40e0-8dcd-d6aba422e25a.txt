Frustrated vent
There’s a member of my family that I wish I were closer to. 

We were very close growing up. As we got older, however, our taste in culture changed dramatically. This member of my family  is not “goth”, necessarily, but he enjoys gory horror movies, death metal music etc. I like some horror movies (the shining, nightmare on elm street), but it’s not a genre I can take for too long, especially the sickening, gory films that make me feel ill. And I do listen to some heavy metal like Black Sabbath and Motörhead, but I’m not a fan of that chug chug chug scream-o stuff. It’s just not my taste. That’s all he surrounds himself with. 

Anyway, him and I are adults now and I feel like his taste in this very depressing niche subculture creates a wall between us. There’s nothing to talk about. I’m open minded to some extent to to his interests, but there’s no reciprocation.  It bums me out. 

Alright. That’s my vent.
