What does this email from a professor mean?
Hello

I am applying to MS programs and the professor said "I emailed \[the admissions coordinator\] to let her know we've been in touch and that I will be interested in offering you a position."

Now, this may be a dumb question but does this mean what I think it means? Am I certain to get in if my application is well put together?
