Is it morally acceptable for workplaces to deny quarantine pay if they think a worker got Covid from doing something they view as irresponsible?
Title says it all.

Since a lot of businesses shorthanded right now and don’t have unlimited money to pay workers that tested positive to sit at home for two weeks, can they restrict quarantine pay to encourage social distancing outside of work? 

They could say if an employee decided to go out somewhere unnecessary in their off time and end up getting Covid; they went against the best interests of the company and aren’t being a team player during this he pandemic, and use that as grounds for either forcing them to quarantine without pay, or even termination. 

Covid testing and contract tracing in general can be used by employers to control their workers activities to work, akin to how people can get fired for social media posts that “go against the values of the company”.

Do you think it would be acceptable for workplaces to do this? Why or why not?
