[CAN] New job and probationary period while pregnant
My wife is 12 weeks pregnant, and a couple weeks ago she resigned from her job, due to issues with her manager. The issues had been ongoing for a while, and she was hoping to ride it out for 6 more months to get to mat leave, be gone for a year and reassess after, but things were quite bad (manager was very difficult/borderline abusive, it was affecting my wife's mental health, etc.) 


After resigning she immediately started looking for another position, has done some interviews, and now has recieved an offer. The position would start in January and has a standard 3 month probationary period. She has not told them she is pregnant during the interview process (this seemed like the right thing to do/common sense/definitely within her rights?)


By the end of the probationary period she will be about 6.5 months pregnant and almost certainly showing. So we are trying to decide what the best way and best time to tell the employer about the pregnancy is. Should she do it now at the time of accepting the offer and hope it doesn't affect how she is treated/viewed during probationary period? Should she wait till the period is over, and potentially endure some awkward weeks of looking definitely-kinda-maybe-certainly pregnant at work? Should she split the difference and wait till she has a good vibe at work, then tell them during the probationary period?


We're aware that technically she cannot be let go or have an offer rescinded due to being pregnant, regardless of probationary period or not, as a human rights issue, but it's still a nuanced situation we want to deal with in the best way. 


More context: we live in Canada, the position is for a clinic administrator for a small psychology clinic (5 doctors/admin). 


Thanks for any/all advice!
