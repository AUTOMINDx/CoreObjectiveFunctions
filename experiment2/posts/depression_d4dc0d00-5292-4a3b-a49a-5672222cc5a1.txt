Feeling alone, even though I have family
I no longer feel/think I can talk to husband about any of this. And of course I can't burden my kid with my problems. Therapy feels like a dead end. 
Day after day I pretend to be functioning. Feel like I'm submerged in darkness. No idea how much longer I can last.
