How do I get rid of a stalker?
Im 14 years broken-down boy and for the past month a guy is stalking me. My dog need to go outside often( Hes still a puppy ) and theres this creepy guy always outside watching me while sitting on a bench. He always acts friendly and tries to have a chat with me. Usually in the evening he follows me to my house. I do not feel safe going outside I tried talking with my mom but she didnt believe me. Any tips?
