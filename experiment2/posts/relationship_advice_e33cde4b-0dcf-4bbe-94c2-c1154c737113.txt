I need help
My boyfriend and I (26) have been together for 4 years. We have always gotten along pretty well. The other day my brother had FaceTimed me. He and his friends were drunk but they wanted to see me because they said they think I’m hot. Whatever, it was all jokes and funny. My boyfriend came walking down the hall and jokingly put me in a chokehold and said “what did they say?” Over and over. It was a joke, but he wouldn’t let go and I wanted to get back to what I was doing. With my left hand, I kind of booped his head and then he let go. 

He was pissed. He said “how dare you lay your hands on me! Don’t you EVER do that to me again.” I ignored it, but he kept saying this. I was a little confused since he was the one who started it. It was instinct to get him off of me. He kept reiterating that it was all a joke and I took it too far. We were supposed to make dinner together. A couple minutes later he comes asking me for an apology and I told him I didn’t mean any harm. He said “you know what, fuck you, make your own dinner bitch.” 

I was so shocked. I started packing my things. I’m at my parent’s house now, but I still have lots of things at the apartment. He texted me saying “you’re really gonna leave without talking about this?” And “is this how it’s gonna end?” There was no reasoning with him, so I left. 

I am at a loss. Did I do anything wrong and where do I go from here? 

TLDR: argument w/ bf caused me to leave suddenly, not sure where to go from here
