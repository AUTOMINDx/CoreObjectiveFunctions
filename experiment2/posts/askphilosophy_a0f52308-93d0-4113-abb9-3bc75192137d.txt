A Few Epistemological Daydreams
A few years ago I used to think that there are something like epistemological categories of people. Let me explain: it would be like the existence of a kind of math person, art person, philosophy person, literature person, etc, and no one of these people cannot change their categories. After some study I start to understand the it is nothing more than a common sense believe, if a person is really good in one area of knowledge nothing prevents he/she of become proficient in another area. What can make this process hard is only social barriers but never a biological one (correct me if I am wrong). But my question is a little bit deeper than this statement:

* Is possible that the knowledge and way of think of an area can be successful applied to another area (something like math knowledge and thinking be applied to literary theory or vice-versa)? 
* If yes, how this process would be (examples please) ?
* If not, why?

Thanks very much in advance!
