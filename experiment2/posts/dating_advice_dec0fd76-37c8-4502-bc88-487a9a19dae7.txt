I did everything I was supposed to do, but I am still alone
I hope this doesn't come off as a pathetic rant, but I just need some answers. 

So I (21M) am still single, have never been in a relationship, still a kissless loser after all these years.

I take great care of myself, I work out, I go out regularly, I think of myself as a social guy, I am pretty good-looking. But nothing seems to work. I've used a lot of dating apps, got a lot of matches, I was just myself on those. But after a few weeks of talking, I would get ghosted once I asked to go on a date. That happend with the last 12 matched last month. I can go out and meet people, I do. But even that never leads to anything. 

And I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Every time it seems to go right I get ghosted or they reject me. I must be doing something wrong, otherwise it means that I'm just unlucky. And that would be even worse.
