Everything is messed up, need advice
Hello dear reddit users!
I'm 21 years old (22 in 1 week). Studying electronics engineering at an above average college. Roughly 850 kilometers away from my family. Even though its my 4th year in college I'm in 2nd grade. Lots of lectures from first and few from 3rd grade and mainly from 2nd. I can't seem to figure out how to solve this situation and economic crisis in my country hit me real hard. I also have weight and other physical related problems. I have been thinking of moving to a college near to my family(and also cheaper city) but I can start that college no earlier than september 2022. I want to give myself 9 months of break to solve all physical, mental problems. To start anew. But my family insists me to stay and finish my electronics degree. I actually don't want to study this programme. I have always dreamt of studying computer engineering. Is it too late to start anew? And since I am totally lost, can any good person suggest me a roadmap to get my life back? Thanks everyone!
