Am I being too picky?
Let me preface this by establishing that I am a 21 (m) who is a few credits away from achieving my associate's degree in liberal arts ( I was extremely hesitant in picking a major) . I've hopped around from job to job trying to find something that I liked or something that I can get into and just bang it out but something seems to be working out for me. Recently I've started my venture into the world of trades, as I have felt in the past that school wasn't really working out for me, but now I'm feeling like I've made a mistake. I've been pulled into the local plumber union being brought on as a helper for the time being, but I can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life. The hours kinda suck and it's very physically intensive. I would like to mention that I'm asthmatic, and have been finding myself wheezing at the end of the workday. Not to mention the concrete dust that's constantly flying around the worksite is extremely bad for the lungs. All of the older guys mention and compare the damage they've sustained to their back over the years and I'm thinking that I'd rather not be falling apart physically by the time I hit 50 ( like my coworkers ). After not really feeling school I'm thinking of going back to school to be a teacher ( of all things &gt;.&lt; ). Of course, the road to being a teacher won't be easy, but I feel like I'd really prefer working in a classroom over doing manual labor in all kinds of weather. Giving the trade a shot feels like it gave me a good lesson that physical labor is not something that I want to be doing, but am I just being a quitter? I'm just worried that I'm never gonna end up finding something I like with all of this jumping around
