How do you move on?
I’ve been with this family as a nanny for 4 years now. I’ve watched these kids grow. The youngest I’ve known his entire life. I love these kids like they’re my own.

But I have an opportunity to grow career-wise (financially too but I digress). And I’ve made the decision to leave them pending good results of this opportunity.

I don’t know how I’m going to do it though. It feels like I’m losing a piece of myself.

All the questions and hesitations have crossed my mind. What if their parents are mad about this and don’t let me see these kids again? Or worse what if they kids hate me after this and then that’s it?

How do you move on from the kids you’ve had to leave behind??
