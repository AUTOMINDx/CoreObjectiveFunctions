[UK]Does it look suspicious if I extend my sick note for a different reason?
I am going through a very rough time now and have a lot of personal problems. I was going to ask for some time off from my GP related to stress and anxiety. Unfortunately this week I got ill and this is what I said to my employer that I have a common cold.  By the end of the week I want to see my GP and ask for some time off related to stress and here is my concern is it not fair/suspicious I said I'm ill because of common cold and I'll give a sick note because of stress for a longer period of time?
