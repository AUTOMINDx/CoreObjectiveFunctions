Job ideas for someone without a degree
I’m 19 currently teaching English in a third world country. It’s not bad but it isn’t great considering how bad the country’s economy is. I’ve been thinking about moving back to the US but I don’t have a degree and not much work experience. I’d like to work with something I can have a career in. I don’t plan on ever doing college because of the stupid amount of debt I’d have afterwards. Does anyone have an advice / recommendations of what I should do?
