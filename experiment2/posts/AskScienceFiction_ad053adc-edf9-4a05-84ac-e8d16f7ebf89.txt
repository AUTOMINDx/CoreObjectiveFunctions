[Harry Potter] Are there muggles who believe that magic and mythical creatures are real but they are labeled as conspiracy theorists because people don't believe them?
I was thinking about this the other day because it would make sense that at some point in history a muggle would have witnessed something magical or explainable happening that they weren't supposed to see, and have since been trying to convince everyone that magic is real but the general population thinks they're just crazy or lying about what they saw.

Is there any official canon about muggles that are not connected to Harry, Newt or anyone in the wizarding world who keeps trying to prove magic is real?
