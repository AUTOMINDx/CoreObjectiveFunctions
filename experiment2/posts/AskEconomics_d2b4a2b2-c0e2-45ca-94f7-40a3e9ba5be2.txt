Couldn't this cause the US to default on their debt?
So, there are crypto currencies trying to create stable value that's depegged from fiat. There are a few projects trying to create crypto reserve currencies so the crypto world can completely decouple from legacy finance. Right now the projects trying to build wealth offer insane interest rates to capture assets, and in a year the interest will drop to reasonable amounts. They're basically trying to create a federal reserve without state affiliation.

I'm guessing no politician would actually repeal social security or other big ticket items to pay off the debt. 
If one of these protocols actually works will the result be the US government defaulting from having to deflate the currency in order to increase demand?
