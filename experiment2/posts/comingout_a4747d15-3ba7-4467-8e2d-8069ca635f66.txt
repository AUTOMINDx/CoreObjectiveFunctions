A friend is scared to come out to parents and asked me for advice but I dont know how to respond
My friend and I were talking and the subject of the LGBTQ+ community came up. He came out to me as bisexual but he was afraid of coming out to his parents. He said he asked his parents about what they thought about the community and his mother was supportive of it as she was pansexual but his stepfather was not as supportive. He has a lesbian sister who had came out to their parents and a straight brother. I told him to wait until he moved out and is stable and then tell them but I'm not sure if that's the right option. I would also appreciate the advice myself too but I was going to come out to them after I move out as nonbinary and pansexual. 

We are both currently freshman in highschool and are still identifying ourselves but we know for sure of our sexuality as of now. Again, I would appreciate anyone who can give any advice to the both of us! Thank you!
