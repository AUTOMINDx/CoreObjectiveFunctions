Is it true that during the 1990s wave of African democratization, “not a single left-wing party emerged”? If so, what forces led to a divergence from, say, Europe, where democratization was *the* cause of the left. [E.g. Geoff Eley’s history of the euro. left is literally titled “Forging Democracy”]
The quote is from John Iliffe’s *Africans*, page 301.

Obviously Europe shouldn’t be the default, but East Asian, Latin American, and South Asian cases seem to also follow that model, at least in the 19th and 20th centuries.
