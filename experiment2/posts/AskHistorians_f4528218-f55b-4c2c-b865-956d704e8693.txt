Spread of Zoroastrianism
Hello r/AskHistorians

I am a very proud muslim. A lot of my Iranian friends complain that Islam was forced on their ancestors (I acknowledge this) and that their real religion is Zoroastrianism. We hear a lot that Islam was spread by force but we don't hear a lot about Zoroastrianism. So how as Zoroastrianism spread throughout Iran/Persia? I'd imagine it would have been primarily by force much like Islam

Also, how long did Zoroastrianism have that rule that people have to be born into it?

TLDR: How did Zoroastrianism Spread? Was it by force?
