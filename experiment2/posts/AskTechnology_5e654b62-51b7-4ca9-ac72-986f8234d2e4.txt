How to use my ancient home theater surround sound on my LG Smart TV / PS5
I'm trying my darndest to get my parents old home theater system (Panasonic SA-HT680 DVD Home Theatre Sound System) to hook up to my LG Smart TV ( LG webOS TV UN7300AUD). 

Ideally I would just want it to work for my PS5 but I'm not sure what splitter and or converter I would need to get my audio system to work with my new TV. Sounds systems are way beyond my understanding at this point, any help would be appreciated
