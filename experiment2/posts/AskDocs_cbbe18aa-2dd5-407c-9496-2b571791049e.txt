Officially a Medical Mystery - Blood Clots Keep Coming

Posting here to see if there are any doctors out there who love a good blood medical mystery.   Out of the thousands of patients my vascular doctor has seen, I am getting to the point where he's never seen anyone like this (lucky me!). 

I got my first blood clot a year ago in my calf.  They found May Thurner, put a stent in and we thought we were done with it.  

I had a spinal fusion in july, and a couple weeks later my whole left side of my body exploded with blood clots.  It was "everywhere" per the doctors.  They did thrombectomy which was like a band aid on a gunshot wound they said.  Leg healed nicely but certainly not fully, when i went to my follow up when I was on Xarelto they found new clots.  

A couple weeks ago they did tPA via Lysis and added more stents, but opened up the vein nicely and was hopefully on the path to recovery.  

I am on Lovenox now and this morning they found more clots. 

So I've now clotted on Xarelto and Lovenox.  Whatever we do, they just keep coming.  I am negative for all the primary genetic factors, I had that workup when I got the first clot a year ago.  Some weird blood tests but nothing that tells any cohesive story.  Low hemoglobin (sometimes), low folate, low in something called MCH concentration (sometimes).  

They found enlarged lymph nodes in my left groin but said they were just likely just reacting to all the damage there.  

My Dr. said we may never know, I just might have "thick blood."  Which is hard for me to believe that for 39 years i was very healthy, then all of a sudden.....

Any ideas I could run by the team for what causes blood clots to just keep forming no matter how much we throw at it?  thanks y'all.
