Does mental illness excuse behaviour or not?
This is something that has been on my mind a lot and can't really figure it out, since there are two sides to this. On the one hand, we seemed to have accepted that depression is a mental illness or at least a mental disorder that affects how you act in profound ways, so you are entitled to some leniency with behaviour, same as you don't expect a wheel-chair bound person to just walk upstairs. On the other hand, you also hear "mental illness doesn't excuse toxic behaviour", by which just because you're mentally ill doesn't excuse you from being racist or being emotionally abusive to your friends or partners. I generally understand both points of view, but then I'm still conflicted where is the line? What if your mental illness causes you to neglect friends due to lack of energy? What if it makes you not hold down a job and rely strictly on family? What if it makes you push away your lover?

How do you guys see this?
