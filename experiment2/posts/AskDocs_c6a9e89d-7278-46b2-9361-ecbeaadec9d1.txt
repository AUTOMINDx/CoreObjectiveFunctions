I have cavities on every tooth. How do I approach a new practice to ask for help?
There have been so many factors contributing to/keeping me from seeking help earlier. I [21F] went to a dental school because I had a visible hole in my tooth, and they told me it was horrible. I had a cavity on every single tooth. I went home crying because I couldn’t afford to fix it- they told me 7000 dollars. I got insurance after that, but I don’t know how to find a dentist who can work on such extensive damage. I’m terrified of walking into a practice and being laughed at or chastised. I already know this is all my fault, I just want someone to help me. 

Is there a specific kind of practice for this kind of work? Or do I just have to take a chance?
