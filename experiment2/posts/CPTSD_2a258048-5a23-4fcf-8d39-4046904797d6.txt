this world makes me sick
so sick to the point it makes me a bit suicidal. i genuinely can’t take it. it’s too much to handle. i’ve made contact with pure evil and i just can’t move past it. i hate humanity.

no like genuinely what the fuck is wrong with people? it’s everyday that i hear abt sick things happening to someone. it’s DISGUSTING. it makes me lose all faith in humanity. why are there SO MANY VICTIMS????? why are there so many traumatized individuals out there?? how come every female friend i’ve ever had has a sexual abuse history??? why are there so many VICTIMS. we walk among peoples abusers. they’re your coworkers, your friends, your classmates, etc. i’m honestly just so sick of humanity.
