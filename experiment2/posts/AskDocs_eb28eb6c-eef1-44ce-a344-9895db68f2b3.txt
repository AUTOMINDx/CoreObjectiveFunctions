Can mild concussions cause permanent brain damage?
[M23] I had my first concussion about a few years ago while swimming doing a backcrawl and hit my head on a wall so the top part of my head got injured, symptoms lasted for about a week or so. Just now as i was laying down, i was smacking my leg to ease the soreness and i felt the recoil and shaking of my head. Now i feel a bit dizzy (2/10). Is this going to cause permanent brain damage? Should i be concerned?
