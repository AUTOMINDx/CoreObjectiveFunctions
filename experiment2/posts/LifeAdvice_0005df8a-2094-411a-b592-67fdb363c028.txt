Do nice people truly exist?
Not trying to be edgy and say “no one has ever shown kindness to me” something like that this is a actual question. I’m asking this just because I am wondering if they do. From how I look at it “Nice” people are just people who want benefits for themselves. They want to be known as a “Nice” person so they do anything to get that role and act different to do so and not actually, be genuine. I do believe in kindness mind you. I don’t know that much and right now be possibly being naive and ignorant. What are your thoughts on this? Thanks!
