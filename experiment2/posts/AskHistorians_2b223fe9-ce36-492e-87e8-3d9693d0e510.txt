Do I have to travel, when I'm a historian?
Hello,

My name is Marilyn and I wanted to ask a question that's been nibbling at my soul. I'm quite intersted in history, and I'm starting to consider maybe becoming a historian. The problem is, as a trans woman, I'm wondering if I'll *have* to travel to dangerous countries. Even though I don't have much interest in the history that takes place in most of these *dangerous* areas, I wanted to ask just incase I ever take interest in them. Thank you in advance.
