i don’t know what to do anymore
I’m 18F and i just started college. my family at home is toxic so i don’t mind not living with them. i started dating this guy (22M) around august, and quickly became attached to him because of how well he treated me. he was respectful, kind, supportive, and everything i’ve wanted in a boyfriend. i’ll get back to him later, but in september my mental health completely tanked. i don’t have confidence anymore, i want to self harm and am having suicidal thoughts again. i can’t get out of bed to clean my room. i’m taking my meds consistently (60mg prozac) and doing everything i’m supposed to, but nothing is working. i keep slipping into a darker place. i’m isolating, i don’t go to parties or anything. the most i do is go to the gym or go to class or go to said boyfriends place. anyways, him and i broke up last night. it was amicable and done for all the right reasons, he’s still a great guy and i still care about him and he cares about me, it just wasn’t right. however, as you can imagine, it did not help my situation. i feel awful this morning. all i’ve been doing is getting up and throwing up. i don’t even have food in my system anymore. this isn’t my first heartbreak, but i think i was just already in such a shit place to begin with. but i realized that because of how much i liked him and attached myself to him, i completely lost myself. now it really feels like i have nothing. i don’t know where to start on getting better, i would say exercise because that’s my main coping mechanism but he’s the one who made my workout program and the whole reason why i got back into the gym. so i don’t know if working out will help or hurt. is it worth it to keep trying? i’ve had severe depression since i was 9 and it’s only ever gotten worse, i feel out of options. if anyone has any sort of comforting thing to say or any advice please, please help me. i’m so lost.
