Help!
So I have a “boyfriend” - never had the conversation so not sure exactly about this label but we’ve been together about 6 months and he asked me to cook him this elaborate dish that has literally taken about 3 hours. He was supposed to be at my house 2 hours ago and he’s still not here. What should I do? Save the last of step for tomorrow (frying the dish), throw it out, or wait til he gets here and cook it? I haven’t heard from him in a few hours and I’m honestly really upset. I don’t want to be childish but idk what to do exactly. Help!
