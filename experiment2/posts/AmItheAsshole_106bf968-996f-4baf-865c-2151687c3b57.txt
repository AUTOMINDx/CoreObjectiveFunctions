AITA for wanting to go on a once in a lifetime vaca over a baby shower?
My sister is having her first baby. Im co hosted her first one this weekend, which was a friends one.

We have a family one scheduled for 2 weeks before baby is due, just at her place ( she wants people to see the nursery.

My dilemma is, I have a friend who is renting a private villa in Mexico for his bday and its over the same weekend as the 2nd shower. I feel like these are both big events but i DO want the free trip to a mexico villa.

Im hesitant, because during a hormonal week, she told me she wasnt going to be in my wedding anymore (which happened a month ago) and that I was selfish and not caring enough about her baby or showign enough excitement about it. She finally agreed to still be in the wedding after my parents spent 2 weeks pleading with her to come to her senses ( and me even having to apolgogize for not showing enough excitement.) I get that she is hormonal...she even said i knew when her shower month "should" have been knowing her due date, so I was selfish for picking a wedding date that would be in tge same month as her shower.

AITA for wanting the vaca versus attending the 2nd shower or is keeping the peace more important?
