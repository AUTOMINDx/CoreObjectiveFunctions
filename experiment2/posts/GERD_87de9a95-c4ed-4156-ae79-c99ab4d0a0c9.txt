Leg weakness?
Reflux flared up about 4 hours ago. Started with the usual symptoms, just felt really full after eating and like I couldn’t breath properly. It starts to get increasingly worse, and about an hour ago (I was lying down also) I could feel the acid coming up my throat and it felt like I was going to throw up. Like I could feel my body trying not to throw up (sorry if that’s gross). Stomach was (and is) burning, back of the throat was (is) also. But about 20 mins ago, my legs started to feel really weak, like jelly, and my arms. My arms aren’t as bad as my legs. I thought maybe it was coz I’d been laid down a while, but when I stood up they were so weak I thought they were going to collapse beneath me. I don’t know if it’s because I could feel my body trying to fight the urge to puke and normally, when you do OR are going to (in my case anyway), your legs usually go really weak. 

I’ve had similar symptoms before, it’s made me feel dizzy and/or slightly weak before, but up until now my legs haven’t become jelly because of it. I’m currently not on any medications for my reflux (and no new medication that I haven’t been on for long enough to know if this was a side effect or not), I were up until a couple years ago, because my reflux got better and I didn’t feel like I needed to take them anymore (that was probably bad, I know). 

Is this a symptom of acid reflux? I know it can trigger many other symptoms and effect other things, but I’m unsure if this is one. Anyone else get jelly legs because of their flare ups?
