Filling an ethically questionable job if I am committed to making it better than someone else would?
Hi everyone. Need advice.

I'm interviewing for a job that I find ethically questionable, to say the least. Think salesman for company that provides, among its products, very high interest rate loans for people with low credit.

However, I feel that I'm in a position to demand a veto against any egregious products. In other words, in my mind, taking this job would mean that fewer people would get sucked into harsh loan cycles than if I forego the job and let someone else take it who is less concerned with this ethical issue.

I think I know the answer here... Just help me understand why I shouldn't take the job.
