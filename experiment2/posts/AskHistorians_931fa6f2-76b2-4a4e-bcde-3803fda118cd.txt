What does the epic of Gilgamesh tell us about ancient Mesopotamia?
I’ve recently gotten into anchient littérature, but I’m having a much harder time contextualizing the pieces within their respective historical settings as I would be able to understand say Hemingway’s work in respect to 1940’s America. Can someone help me understand (or link me to a resource) that would help me best understand ancient Mesopotamia and what aspects are replicated in the epic of Gilgamesh?
