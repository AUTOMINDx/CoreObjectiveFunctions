Is engineering good for me?
27m. Currently a nurse. I'm an introvert and love coming up with solutions to problems. I feel that my current career in nursing is very draining emotionally and mentally, and feel I would best fair in something related to science.

Is engineering a good field for introverts? And those with (medicated) ADHD?
