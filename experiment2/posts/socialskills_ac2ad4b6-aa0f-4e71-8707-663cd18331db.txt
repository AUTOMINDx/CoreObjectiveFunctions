How to create a deep/close relationships?
21F, four year into college. Have no troubles making "friends" but I feel like none of them is actually close to me. With these friends I go out and do fun things with them but we don't really talk otherwise. Also, these friendships feel really disposable, like it usually take them more than a day to respond to my text(or not reply at all). Although I go out a lot, there's no one I can talk about my problems with or even just to chat about how my day has been going.  It's like none of my relationship are deep enough that the person is kinda "obligated" to give a shit about me. It has been that way for \~ 5 years now and the loneliness is killing me. How do I change it?
