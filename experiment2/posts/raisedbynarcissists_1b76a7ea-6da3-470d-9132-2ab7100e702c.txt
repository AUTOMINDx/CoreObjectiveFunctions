I found a 2 years old text message conversation I had with my Mum that literally shows her enabling my abusive Dad
So I came to the realisation a few days ago that my Mum is the enabler and my Dad is the emotionally and physically abusive narcissist. Immediately I made a ton of connections about the whole thing and I'm still discovering more.

I decided to go back and look at my text messages to my Mum. And I stumbled across these gems, 3 different sets of text messages all summarising the situation I've found myself in.

1. Context for the first image: He dropped us off at school and said he wasn't picking us up and we had to find a way home ourselves, I was 14, my sister 11. This was completely out of the blue and he said it as we got out the car.

On top of that there are easily 50+ more that suit the bill. I used to text my Mum nearly every 2-3 days while in high school as my Dad was emotionally and physically abusive which I thought was "tough parenting" and a part of growing up. It got so bad to the point where I would type out paragraphs of what he's done and how he's acting and she wouldn't even respond to them. And if she did respond to them, she'd pass it off as nothing and not even speak to him about it, let alone do something about the situation.
