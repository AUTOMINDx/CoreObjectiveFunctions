Re-learning how to cry.
So I used to cry all the time when I was little because my mother liked it but I haven't really cried since I emancipated myself ten years ago. Even when I want to cry, I usually can't unless I'm alone and there's a lot of white noise. And when I finally do it's just a few tears and some sniffles. Sometimes I really want to curl up on the couch with a box of chocolates, turn on a sad movie and cry. Does anyone have ideas on how to lean how to cry?
