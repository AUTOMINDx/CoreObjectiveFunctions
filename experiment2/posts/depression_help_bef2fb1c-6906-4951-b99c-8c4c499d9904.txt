How to handle this
I am very depress and feeling extremely uneasy thing moving in my stomach and heart idk.I want to cry out loud but not able to do it...

Starting from a trip that supposedly to be 4 day but later on extended and join with 2nd trip so totally 9 day.

Me and 4 more other when on a trip,I really love one of the girl,on 2nd days while I sleep other of my friend go and told her that I like her and she said she just treat me normal and she have other in her mind.I was so extremely sad and couldn't eat and sleep well.

So the trip went on and next day while only me and another friend was out buying something she told me this,I feeling so sad but still don't want to give up.So since that day the trip is awkward between the girl I like and me and it continues like that for next 7 day,I really feel like killing myself.

Now we are back and we still met in class at almost every single day,I didn't know how to act...I am so sad and didn't know what to do it never been like this in extremely sad mood and god,I can't even cry out,I feel like vomiting all the time,even drinking water,can't breath nicely as how I used to be most of time...
