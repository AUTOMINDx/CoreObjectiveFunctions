[NC] How do I professionally ask to be transferred to a different location?
I work for a big red and gold bank based in the US. I am currently a banker in a branch but I’ve held 3 other internal positions that I excelled at and was top 5 in each department. I was also in a leadership program and one of eleven out of 300 applicants who applied. I’ve always done well in this company. But since I took this new position I hate my job. I hate my manager. I hate the people I “help”. I hate going to work. Literally this morning my manager said “expect to be a teller until I tell you otherwise”  so fuck what I was hired for I guess. This feeling of dread is something intense that I’ve never felt before. My mental health is garbage. I’m struggling hard, I feel there’s no hope in carrying on but I’m not ready to leave the company just yet. I don’t have anything lined up. My boyfriend suggested transferring branches but I have no idea how to bring this up or explain why I’ve made this decision. I JUST found out the district manager will be in my branch tomorrow and I already have to speak to him regarding a pay issue that could have been totally prevented (another reason I hate this job) so I might as well mention it. 

The issue is My branch is extremely busy and often borrows bankers from other branches so I know he’s going to ask why I want to leave and push me to stay. He won’t want me to move out of there unless I have a good reason. Part of me just wants to lay everything out but another part of me knows I’m going to cry and let my emotions get in the way as I’ve been feeling that mentally out of sorts. I genuinely feel that if I stay here, I will quit. No notice. And lose my shit. 

Can someone help lay the ground work for that conversation? How should I phrase this without seeming over emotional but still getting my point across?
