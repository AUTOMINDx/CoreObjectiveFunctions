I'm angry because I have CPTSD
Why me ? 

I feel it's really unfair .. I'm way behind normal people because how dysfunctional I'm I can't even do or simple stuff or have what's normal people have like romantic relationship or friends .. sticking to a job for a long time and the list goes on an on  

I have a dream and a vision that I want to achieve ,but because of my CPTSD it feels impassable and funny for how far I am from it and because of my endless failure and attempts and repeating my dysfunctional pattern I'm soaked in shame and guilt

I feel angry because life is in itself hard and dealing with cptsd makes it extremely difficult to the point you start to think to exit this game called life
