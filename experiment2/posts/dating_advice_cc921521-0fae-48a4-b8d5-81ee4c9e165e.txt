What do you talk about with someone WAY out of your league on a first date?
Hi I'm a girl, I haven't dated in a year because I was mourning my devastating break-up. Now I'm ready to find love again so I set up a Bumble account (Tinder was full of hookup guys). I matched with this guy (23M) who looks like a young Brad Pitt lol, and he asked to take me out on a date this Friday. He said he is looking for a relationship just like me!! I'm excited but also very scared, I haven't really talked to guys in a while and especially because this guy is what you would call a 10 I'm worried my mind will turn blank. I don't want to ruin my chances.

P.S. He added me on snapchat and has sent me videos of himself, so I'm certain he's not a catfish
