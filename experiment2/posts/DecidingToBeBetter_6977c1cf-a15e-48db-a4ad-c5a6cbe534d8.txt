went to my first ACA and CoDA meetings today
I went to my first Adult child and codependents anonymous meetings today. Earlier today I was making excuses for why I wouldn't go but I ended up pushing through those thoughts and showing up. I am so grateful to now have these safe spaces to process my trauma and work on improving my relationship with myself and others. I'll be going again next week for sure. Thank you for witnessing.
