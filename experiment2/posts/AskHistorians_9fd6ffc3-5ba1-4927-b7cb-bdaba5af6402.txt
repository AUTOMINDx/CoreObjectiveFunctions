In 1948, Shirley Jackson wrote a story where a teenaged girl accuses the older generation of not doing enough to prevent what she sees as an inevitable, apocalyptic catastrophe. What would that catastrophe be?
The story is "[The Intoxicated](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~ina22/+301/hnrs301-text-Intoxicated.html)", and it's written in a way that suggests the apocalyptic catastrophe this girl fears should be obvious to a 1948 audience.

She says that: "I think of the churches as going first, before even the Empire State building. And then all the big apartment houses by the river, slipping down slowly into the water with the people inside, and the schools... The subways will crash through, you know, and the little magazine stands will all be squashed."

She blames the older generation, saying: "If people had been really, honestly scared when you were young we wouldn't be so badly off today" and: "It isn't as though we didn't know about it in advance."

The obvious answer seems to be nuclear destruction, but her comments that the previous generation should have seen it coming don't fit for 1948.

What disaster would the youth of this time fear that they would blame on their parents?
