What kind of structure/system would best protect electrical components from weather for an extended amount of time?
I build and implement photo installations for a living -- mostly in New York City, but also in other locations around the world. So far, all of them have been indoors, but I'd like to be able to build and install them outdoors in public parks, pedestrian malls, street corners, and the like so that they operate despite the heat, cold, precipitation, humidity, etc. These installations would ostensibly stay up for months and years at a time. The components which would need protecting are: DSLR, off-camera strobe, Raspberry Pi's, HD displays. Thoughts on how best to do so? Would some sort of combination of double-wall housing and a mini HVAC system or fans do it? Don't know if just venting would be enough for the extremes of New York summers and winters.
