It will never be my turn to be happy
Does anyone else ever feel like this? Anytime I’ve ever received even a sliver of something in life that makes me happy it is snatched away from me. From either the universe or my own personal fuck up. Why is it that it is never my turn to be happy? It is never my turn to feel something good for once. So many people around me are happy and have great things going for them, yet here I am fucking stuck.
I will never be happy. So what’s the point anymore.
