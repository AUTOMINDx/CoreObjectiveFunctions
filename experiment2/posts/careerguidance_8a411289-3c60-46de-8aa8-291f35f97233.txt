I have to answer critical questions about my boss for their year end review. How do I answer?
I have a boss that is very stand-offish.  I like them a lot but maybe only talk to them once a month.  It’s a good relationship because I like to do my own thing and they trust that I get it done.  However, for their year end review I have to answer the following question, “what area of x’s leadership might they consider developing”

My problem is A. I genuinely don’t know my boss well enough to answer that question and B. I don’t want to answer the question to the point where now they make a change that messes with the way we run things now.  

My company tends to over correct criticism.  What’s a neutral response that’s not phoning it in?
