[Marvel] Is the wider galaxy unaware of things such as pym particles, time travel, magic, etc.
I find it hard to believe that for such a comparatively primitive planet, earth is seemingly host to so many universe shattering scientific and mystical advancements/beings. Is it just a case of earth being the centerpiece of most stories or is there in universe explanation/examples of such advancements/entities taking place outside of earth?
