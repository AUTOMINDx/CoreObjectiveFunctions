Career growth suggestions/courses for leadership role
Hi all,

I am approaching a turning point in my career and I am starting to think about the next steps in growing my skills.

Some background, I am a mid 30's engineer working in Vancouver, BC in the mobile equipment industry. I've been in my role for approx 5 years, been a P.Eng for about half of that. I'm being recommended into a senior engineer role and for all intents and purposes I am the team leader for my group although not in title as my team is quite small; so more of a technical lead. I am happy in my role and it provides great work/life balance. The pay is decent and just cracks 100k with my bonus. 

I am starting to think about what is the next step to aim for. A leadership role seems logical. Are there any key courses or certifications that might help someone in my position gain leadership skills? How useful is an MBA for an engineer? Essentially looking for any kind of opinions/thoughts on career growth.

Thanks for any suggestions!
