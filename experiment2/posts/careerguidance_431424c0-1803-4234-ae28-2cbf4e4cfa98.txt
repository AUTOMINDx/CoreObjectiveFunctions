How to transition out of medicine?
First time poster.


Have very desirable “dream” job, have hit all relative career benchmarks at their expected times, with dream benefits but no passion for it any longer and just feel like a technician. It’s demanding and requires extra time outside a normal work day on a regular basis; won’t change over the years. No real directional moves to make given the nature of my speciality - it’s all the same work. I just want more time with my family and to enjoy life. I don’t enjoy what I currently spend 50-60+ hours of my week doing. I don’t want to miss my life because I was too caught up in work. No amount of money would make it better; money is great as is. I’m seriously considering leaving medicine but have no idea what kind of cross transferable skills I have?! Or how to market those. I can’t really visualize what any other company would ask me to do.


Anyone have any resources? I’ve seen the drop out club website and it’s garbage/just MLM ads
