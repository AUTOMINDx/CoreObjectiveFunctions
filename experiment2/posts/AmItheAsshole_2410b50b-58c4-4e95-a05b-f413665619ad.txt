AITA for not warning my cousins that my fiancé could understand them when they were speaking about him in a different language?
My fiancé comes from a very mixed background and speaks a lot of languages. His great grandmother comes from the same country as my grandparents so he speaks Urdu too. A lot of people assume he’s just white, though, and just looking at him you wouldn’t guess he has Pakistani ancestry.

Three of my cousins met him for the very first time on Saturday. In front of him, they switched to Urdu and were asking me questions about him including where did I find this hot white man. I told them to stop and they did and switched back to English. My mum called me to help her set the table for dinner so I left them alone with my fiancé. 

While I was gone, they switched back to Urdu and were making inappropriate comments about my fiancé. He said he found it funny and when they were wondering if they should ask me if the white man was good in bed he told them I wouldn’t know yet in Urdu and they freaked out. They ended up leaving before dinner because they were so mortified and then today, they called me to yell at me for not telling them and claimed they were only joking around and never would’ve said any of those things if they knew he understood. They did apologise to my fiancé but still blame me for not warning them since they had no way of knowing he would understand them and I knew they liked to make dumb jokes.

AITA?
