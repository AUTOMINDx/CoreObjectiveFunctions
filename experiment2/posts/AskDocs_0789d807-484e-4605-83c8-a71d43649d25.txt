40 Years old, 230 lbs, 6'1", White Male, regular smoker, regular drinker, regular drug user, no regular prescriptions.

From the USA but frequent Colombia often recently. Have had sexual relations with quite a few women in Colombia. This has been happening for around 2 weeks now. There is quite a bit of pain which affects walking to the point going to work isn't an option. Been tested for STD's to no avail. Maybe it's a regional thing? I am not sure but local doctors don't know what it is.
