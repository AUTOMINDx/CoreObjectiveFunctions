How can I develope a stronger character?
I am the kind of guy who doesn't know when to say no. I don't feel like I have good communication skills and my jokes usually turn awkward. I have hard time expressing myself and end up getting boring. I talk to much only to make my point and make it difficult for other to listen. I have hardtime focusing to others during a discussion and usually give wrong answers.

Thanks for the feedback üëç
