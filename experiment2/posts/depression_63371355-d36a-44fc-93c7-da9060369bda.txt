I just want to die
I feel guilty every day because I feel like I've failed my family. I'm a university student and my parents are helping me out even though we're poor, and I'm not doing so good academically. I have a lot on my shoulders and I just want to rest. I thought things would get better once I got into college, but it's the same shit, except this time I have to pay. So now I'm just spending more money taking classes that I'm failing. I have to act as if I'm okay at home, but I'm not. I can't push myself academically anymore. I know I'm just whining and complaining when everyone has worse situations than me but I can't help feeling this way. Some days I'm happier than others, but I know I always go back to feeling sad and unmotivated. It never changes and I'm tired of existing. I wish I could die of an illness so that no one thinks my family failed to raise me. I've thought of just killing myself in some random area my parents will never be able to visit so that they never have to visit the site of my death. While it is expensive having to pay for my funeral expenses, I know it will be better than having to waste money on their useless child every single day that I continue to live.
