Is there some truth or knowledge too profound to be expressed in human language (or generally, to be understandable by human reason)?
I know it is a deep-rooted and recurrent theme in Eastern Philosophy. 'The way that could be expressed is not the eternal Way' from Laotzu, or in Buddhism where the noble truths cannot be truly explained in human language.
