What is the economic impact of intellectual property legislation?
The typical justification for having intellectual property such as patents and copyrights is that it incentivizes innovators and creators to produce inventions/art by giving them a temporary monopoly so they can profit.

That sounds nice in theory, but is this claim something that is actually strongly backed by data and has strong consensus among economists?
