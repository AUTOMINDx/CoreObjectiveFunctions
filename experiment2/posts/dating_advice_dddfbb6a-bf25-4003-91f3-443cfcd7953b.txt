Being ghosted
A girl I saw a few times and seemed to hit it off with pretty well got in touch during the week, after a few days of radio silence, and wanted to avail of my invite of a movie night in mine. Naturally I made plans for this, and was texting up until 2hrs before our arranged time. Then I was ghosted after trying to get in touch at the time. Why do people do this? What's the benefit? Is hurting someone and not even seeing them hurt a fetish? I don't get it.
