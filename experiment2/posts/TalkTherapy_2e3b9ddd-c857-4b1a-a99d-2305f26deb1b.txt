Could it be that my student counselor doesn’t quite understand the concept of making actual irl friends?
I’ll start off by saying I’ve been in counseling nearly a year now and one of the main reasons I’m here is because I have no irl friends or social circle and never have. So I express my lingering loneliness and isolation to her every session or so, we have brainstormed ideas and ways to make in real life friends and such, but I almost feel frustrated now and that r maybe she doesn’t understand the concept of actually making a friend???

She said “hobbies and similar interests”
But it’s more than that isn’t it? it has to be, I just don’t understand.
She’s telling me that friends comes down to these simple things? I have a few interests and hobbies, if that’s all I needed then why am I still friendless?
