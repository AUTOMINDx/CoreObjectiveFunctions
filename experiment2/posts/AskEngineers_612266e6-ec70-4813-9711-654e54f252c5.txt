How easy have you found it to request to be relocated, while still working for the same company?
Preface: I have not asked this question to my boss yet; I wanted to garner your thoughts, first.

I’m a relatively-recent grad (2019), having worked at my first full-time job for close to two years now. I work for a very large company.

Overall, I like my job, and I really enjoy working with my coworkers (I am essentially a remote worker, at this point). However, I REALLY don’t like where I currently live. I had not been/lived in my current city, before taking the position — I kinda operated on the mindset of, “Well, let’s give this a shot,” when I accepted the position (I had a brief visit of the city when I was brought in for my final interview; from what I was able to take in at the time, I thought the city was cool).

So, I wanted to hear your thoughts/experiences — if I’m able to do my job successfully, as a remote worker, and I wanted to live elsewhere, do you think I have a good chance of being relocated, if I request to do so?

I apologize if this post is inappropriate for this sub — I’m a fellow engineer (albeit, very young and inexperienced), and just trying to navigate through everything.

Thank you in advance.
