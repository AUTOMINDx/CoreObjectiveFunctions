How hard does getting one interview at McDonald's have to be???
I live in a small town and am desperately trying to get a job before I lose my home. I've never worked in an official capacity before due to life circumstances outside my control, and the only place that's even bothered feigning interest so far has been McDonald's. I applied online, got an interview date set up, and went. The manager who does the interviews wasn't in that day. I come back the next day at the same time and I've just missed him by 10 minutes because he left early to attend a PTA meeting. Come back the next day at the same time and he's not in because he called out sick. Come back the next day again and finally get him, but he reschedules it for another day. I come in that day, but he can't do any interviews because his tablet charger isn't working. It's now Thanksgiving week and I come back, and he basically says that this week is too busy for interviews and to come back next week, so I do. This time it's something about "end of month managerial duties", and he has me put down my name and number and says he'll get to me when he has time. A friend of mine who works there says they have a lot of positions open and are short on staff, so they're hurting for people, yet I feel like I'm getting the run around. Should I even expect to hear from this guy, or is the labor shortage everyone talks about actually a manufactured crisis?
