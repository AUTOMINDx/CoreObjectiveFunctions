How does therapy works
I never had any therapists or talk to any therapists aside from the guidance counselor in my former schools so I am curious, how does therapy works? If I started going to therapy (which I'm planning to in the future) do I have to mention all my issues on the first day? Or is my therapist gonna set a schedule for what issues are we gonna tackle for that session? I think I have a long list of unsolved traumas and I don't know how to vent it out on my future therapist.
