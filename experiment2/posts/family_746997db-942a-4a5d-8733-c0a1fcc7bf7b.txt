Processing Divorce
I hope this is the right place for this.

My brother called me last night and told me that his wife is leaving him. And it has just left shockwaves in the family. No one knew they were in a bad spot. Her decision caught even him by surprise. He knew there was something off, but never realized it was that far.

My brothers and I are children of divorced parents, so it's hitting real hard. Our dad left our mom, and that left some deep wounds.

She apparently told him that she just doesn't love him the way he needs anymore. I just hate that excuse. It just feels like she is giving up and I don't like that. I just got married this year and my wife and I have spoke many times about fighting tooth and nail to make sure our marriage lasts.

I'm not sure I have a question but I'm open to hear other points of view about how you all have processed divorce in your family.
