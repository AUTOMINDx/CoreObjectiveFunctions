Has anyone felt like an imposter at a new job?
Hi! To be as brief as possible, about 2 months ago I made a significant jump in jobs. I came from a small company where not much was expected of me and was given tons of guidance, to a huge company where a lot is expected of me. 

I got the job through a colleague who passed my info along, and interviewed well. Now that I’ve been in it for a few weeks, I just feel very under qualified and almost feel like I wouldn’t have gotten this opportunity without my reference because they can see past my skills. 

I have the knowledge but am missing some of the technical work to be the most successful from the start. My colleges are nothing but supportive, respectful &amp; patient. I guess I am having what some would call imposter syndrome.  

Can anyone provide any insight or make me feel less alone. Give me some positive stories about similar situations? Thanks all.
