Exhausted and need to vent. Sorry
I’ve really been struggling lately. Things have been especially rough for the last 2 years but last week made things worse. It started with seeing my extremely critical family for thanksgiving. Comments about my body, my aunt sending me links to diets (I’m 17f, and I’m barely 135 pounds like wtf) but it doesn’t stop. Then the pressure to go to a good college from them and I’m considering taking some time off after I graduate. Then they like to bring up my sisters death 5 years ago and insinuate it was partly my fault (somewhat true but it’s not what I wanna talk about for an hour.) My mom got pissed at them when I told her and does not like those family members but she won’t admit it. Already told her I’m not going with them to christmas there, but if I stay home most of my friends will be out of town too and I’ll likely be alone. And to make things even worse my “amazing” boyfriend broke up with me abruptly and brutally the morning after thanksgiving for no fault of my own. Still doesn’t feel real. I’ve had boyfriends before and completely thought he was my soulmate. Does anyone please have any advice for breakups like this (I’ve had shitty people break up with me before but never someone I thought of so highly like I did him). Or any ideas of how to get through Christmas or what I should do. Sorry for the long post but thank you so so much for reading
