I help everyone at work, yet no one returns the favor. Am I justified to quit?
I work at an Italian restaurant, and I absolutely hate it. I started like 17 months ago, and about 6 months ago, they hired all new people, and I hate every single one of my new coworkers. I’m the last original member.

I do various things like wash dishes, cook, prep food, etc.

I always try to help people when they’re having trouble. I’m constantly putting my work aside, yet people can’t do the same for me. 

If I’m on dishes that night, I walk in to a sink full of unwashed dishes. Fine. But I’m immediately bombarded with tasks and requests from my boss and coworkers. I put my work aside the entire night to help people, yet when it’s closing time…everyone leaves and I’m stuck working alone.

I hate where I work so much. I clock in, and no one says shit to me. Not a “Hi” or “Hey what’s up?” 

I get treated as less than. I feel like a total stranger to everyone, even though I’ve been there for over a year than everyone else. Then the workers have the guts to boss ME around…even though they’re not my boss. I don’t even try to hide my emotions anymore. I clock in, go to my station, and I don’t say anything. I don’t laugh or joke around with people anymore.

My boss doesn’t care. She’s part of the the problem too. When I clock into work, she will look up at me, say nothing, then look back down at her work….yet when someone else clocks in…it’s “Danny!!! Buddy!” 

I don’t know what I did wrong, but I DO know that I can’t take it anymore.

My boss knows my days there are numbered. We have our holiday party this month, and I’m telling my boss that I’m not going. No way in hell am I going. 

Anyone have any advice? What did I do wrong? Am I wrong to quit? I mean I hate my job…why would I stay anywhere where people ignore me, AND I hate what I do
