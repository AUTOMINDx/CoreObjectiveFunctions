Sony XV-T33 Titler - Is this fixable?
Picked up this Sony XV-T33 Titler recently. It worked perfectly exactly one time. The second time I tried to use it I got no video output and later noticed a slight electronic burning smell. It still powers on and all the buttons and sounds appear to work.

Opened it up to find what I believe to be the culprit. One connection appears to have burnt a little and the adjacent capacitor looks like it needs to be replaced. Is it just a matter of replacing the capacitor and that multi-pin wire? I have no circuit repair / soldering experience but now seems like a good time to learn.

(Bonus question: does anyone know what the switch in the last photo does? It's only accessible if you take the device apart.)

[The capacitor is a 4700uf 10v](https://preview.redd.it/3kwfoj3j1v281.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ef98118381bc64885b27a0d0f5b805e301a84a4)
