[Outlander] Why can't Claire hear the stones the first few times she's at Craigh na Dun?
Throughout the novels (and I think TV show too), people who are sensitive to the power of the standings stones hear them humming and feel their pull the closer they get to them, but Claire doesn't seem affected. I can see how the first time she and Frank go up there they aren't "open" yet but certainly when she goes back for herbs/flowers she should've felt/heard something, right?
