Long story short i (19m) might be bi now
So i was reading a story here on reddit and it has made me rethink my sexuality. I have been straight for as long as I can remember and tbh i never really gave it any deeper thought. After reading it i started to think deeper and started to question my sexuality do i just like women or am i interested in more? I want to know if it is like just a fetish or if could i actually be bi?

I won't go into detail but the story was about a person who had a very sexual experience with a man and i enjoyed the thought of being in the position of this person and having what happened to them happen to me and doing what they did.

I'm going to spend the next few days thinking about this but i would appreciate opinions and thoughts on this matter.
