[Avatar] Can an Avatar who isn’t an Air Nomad still get the Airbender tattoos?
I’m talking mostly about before the events of TLA and not the whole Harmonic Convergence thing. Avatar Roku, for example, trained with Air Nomads at one of the Air Temples, and presumably followed every aspect of their lifestyle. When he mastered it, if he wanted, could he get his tattoos?
