Meeting people without dating apps?
This one might sound silly. I’m 25 and recently deleted all of my dating apps as they just seem way more toxic and superficial the older I get. 

So basically I gotta meet people in person now which is gonna be hard. One because most of my friends are married / partnered and don’t really like to go out much and those that do like to go out don’t really like crowded places where people our age hang. 

So I kinda have to go out by myself which is hard. Most of my hobbies / interests aren’t exactly social activities or don’t require me to be in social situations and idk what to do. 

I know I have to try but idk how to make things happen at this spot I’m in
