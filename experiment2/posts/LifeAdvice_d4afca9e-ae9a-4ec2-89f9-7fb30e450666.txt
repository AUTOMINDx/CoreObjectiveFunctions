[Moderator] Posts being used as platforms for ideologies
We have noticed posts lately which are being used to promote ideologies, namely incel ideas, the posts contain frequent and flagrant sexism. These users are not asking for help but will reject help, and respond reiterating their ideology.

We believe that users should be able to voice their concerns about anything freely, advice should be available to all, but when it's clear that these posts are being used to ignore help and push an agenda then we ask that you report them so we can handle them appropriately. Please no vigilantism.

Thank you again to everyone doing an amazing job here, we're proud of you.
