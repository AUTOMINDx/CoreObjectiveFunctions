/r/askphilosophy Open Discussion Thread | November 29, 2021
Welcome to this week's Open Discussion Thread. This thread is a place for
posts/comments which are related to philosophy but wouldn't necessarily meet our
[posting rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/rules). For example,
these threads are great places for:

* Personal opinion questions, e.g. "who is your favourite philosopher?"

* "Test My Theory" discussions and argument/paper editing

* Discussion not necessarily related to any particular question, e.g. about what
  you're currently reading

* Questions about the profession


This thread is **not** a completely open discussion! Any posts not relating to
philosophy will be removed. Please keep comments related to philosophy, and
expect low-effort comments to be removed. All of our normal [commenting
rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/rules)
are still in place for these threads.
