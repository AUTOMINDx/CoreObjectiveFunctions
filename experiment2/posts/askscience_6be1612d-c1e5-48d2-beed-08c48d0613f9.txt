How do T-Cells recognize a virus differently than Antibodies?
I've seen some people indicate that cellular (T-Cell) immunity to Omicron may be preserved even if neutralizing antibodies are not.  I would have thought the T-Cells "learn" the same pattern as the antibodies do by exposure to the spike proteins generated by your body in response to the vaccines.  How does it work that T Cells can recognize a mutated virus more effectively than antibodies do?
