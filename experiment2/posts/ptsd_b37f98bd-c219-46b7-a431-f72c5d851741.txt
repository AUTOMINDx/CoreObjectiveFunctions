Started trauma therapy
Hi all,
This is a happy post: I started trauma therapy with my therapist. I’m working on doing activities that make me anxious and I also have to listen to a recording of me discussing my trauma.  While both things make me feel very bad in the moment, after I feel way way better.  I didn’t have a panic attack at night or this morning (although I cannot sleep through the night) nor did I dissociate. I am also able to ignore my cyclical intrusive thoughts about my identity and relationship because I have proof of the root of my trauma (my official diagnosis is ptsd with ocd like symptoms).  I am definitely not 100% but I am also not at 1% either.  
Additionally during my therapy it feels like I have uncovered a lot of traumatic memories that have negatively affected my life, and the truth all along was that I really needed intense psychological help. I feel that I’m on track to being a better partner and person.
