Should I stop seeing her because of her apartment?
So this requires background. Ive (23m) been to this girls (22f) apartment 3 times. First time I wasn't allowed to see the kitchen and there was piles of clothes everywhere and it was a mess and i felt really uncomfortable. Second time was same as the first only now there was wine glasses with spoiled chocolate milk in them. 3rd time was the worst by far as I saw the kitchen. I thought I would be nice and offer to help her clean. I'm definetly not a clean freak but ive always loved playing house with my partners and I thought i could do something nice for her. So i offered and I had never seen something that bad before. There was clumps of mold inside water bottles and i had to throw away over half of her silverware and a handful of plates and glasses. It took upwards of 3 hours to clean just the dishes, i didnt even get a chance to clean out the fridge or anything like that. After that we cooked and she insisted on using this air fryer that was just caked in god knows what and refused to let me clean it. I am pretty sure it got me sick when she had me eat what she cooked in there. Ever since I've been avoiding her apartment and honestly the whole thing has made me look at her differently.

I have never really had to deal with this type of situation before honestly. To me it sets off an alarm that she may not be able to take care of herself and if I needed her help later she might not really be able to take care of me either.  Then again I could be wrong. Other than this one thing she has been pretty great and while I think she can in general be childish I also think she is a sharp woman. 

Basically is this situation a red flag and grounds for me to leave or am i being stupid? If not how do I approach this?
