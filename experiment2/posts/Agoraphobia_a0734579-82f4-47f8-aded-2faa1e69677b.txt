Need Support
I deal with agoraphobia, severe anxiety, panic attacks and depression. I also deal with Chronic Pain. I haven't left the house in around 4 years. Now I am having bad falls. The last two falls ended up with me breaking ribs. My Fam Dr. has been great with phone appointments, but now my Pain Specialist is retiring and with Covid vaccines easily, accessible my new Pain Dr. wants in Office Appointments. They have been informed about my Agoraphobia I can't do that. Especially with a Dr. I don't know. Oh and I am not vaccinated and the Office is inside a hospital. When I called, I ended up in tears, having an anxiety attack. Well now I have been kicked out the clinic and they told my regular Dr. He would have to take over my case. Problem is that he can't prescribe the pain meds I take. I can't even walk out my front door let alone go get vaccinated, then to get bloodwork! Plus I would have to take a cab to get there and another to the hospital. I know it's important   and people keep telling me that, but they don't understand how these issues affect me. I am hoping people here who understand can reply. I'm so tired of hearing "just do  it", "it can't be that bad". Etc. Etc. I guess what I'm saying is (not to be rude in the slightest), I don't need a lecture, I need support. Thanks in advance. ðŸ™‚
