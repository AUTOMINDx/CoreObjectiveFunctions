Magnesium glycinate usage/dosage/brand/etc
Hi friends! I have PTSD and fibromyalgia (as many of us do, apparently it's a horribly common dual-diagnosis), and in reading about others' medicating habits, I read about a couple people SWEARING by magnesium glycinate and using nothing else.

Now, I am not ready to jump off my other meds or anything, but I am totally okay with adding supplements into my diet.

I just don't know what dose to start with or what a reputable brand would be. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks ðŸ˜Š
