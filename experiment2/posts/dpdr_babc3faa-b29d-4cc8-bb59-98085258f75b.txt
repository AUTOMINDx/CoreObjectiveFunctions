Trying to get Spravato (esketamine)
Hi friends! I’ve had DPDR for most of my 25 years of life and 24/7 for over a decade. Along with DPDR I have anxiety, OCD, and severe depression that has been with me just as long as DPDR. Recently I heard about Ketamine infusion along with Spravato, a nasal spray, and it’s high success rate for treating treatment resistant depression. It seemed a bit scary since it makes you disassociate and something I wouldn’t have access to where I am. But I found out there is a clinic close by to me and since I have chronic DPDR already I can deal with the extra disassociation.

There is still a ways to go, I still need to speak with my doctor, get accepted, etc, but I’m trying to be hopeful. If I do manage it I will update my journey for those of you like me or who are just interested.
