Your mind is extremely powerful
It’s crazy how powerful our brains are, one moment you can be fine, then boom you feel a instant dread of anxiety. If your brain is anything like mine you have racing thoughts, it feels like your brain just can’t stop. I’ve always had a racing mind, but add anxiety to that and you are in for one hell of a combination. What helps me is going to a happy place, whether it be cuddling up in your bed, watching your favorite show, whatever brings you comfort. Anxiety is a pain in the ass, but it doesn’t have to be.
