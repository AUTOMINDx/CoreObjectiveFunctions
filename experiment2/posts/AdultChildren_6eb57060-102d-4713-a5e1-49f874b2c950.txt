Boundaries Are Hard
My mother is an alcoholic and has been my whole life. Many relapses, recoveries, and some jail time. It's always been a rollercoaster but the past couple years have been particularly rough since my grandpa (her dad) died in 2019. He provided a lot of financial (and emotional) support for her. Now it's basically just me and I'm trying really hard to have good boundaries with her. I know it's not my job to save her or fix her, but old habits die hard. I've been working on this with my therapist...

I've just been feeling really guilty lately as she may be homeless right now. Last I heard her landlord sold the place she was staying, and I'm not sure if she has found anywhere else. Rationally I know there isn't anything I can do. I've let her live with me before, I'm always the one to help her move, and when she was in the hospital I packed and moved her entire apartment (on my own, in one day). But knowing she may be homeless and may have lost everything (that I worked so hard to save) has been weighing on me.

She hasn't asked me for anything, but I can't help but feel like she's waiting for me to offer. That's always been our dynamic and I know it needs to change. I know I'm doing what I need to do by staying out of things, but it's hard. I just want her to be okay. But that's not my responsibility and I don't get to decide that.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading.
