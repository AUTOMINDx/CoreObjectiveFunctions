How can a star going supernova that is the right mass form a blackhole?
I'm struggling to find answers that are specific enough for my question so I thought i'd ask here..

As I understand it, if something explodes it just dissipates it's energy outwards.

What I'm struggling to understand is how can something explode and create something else that sucks everything inwards including light like a blackhole does.. is the explosion so violent it creates a 'hole' in spacetime that creates them?
