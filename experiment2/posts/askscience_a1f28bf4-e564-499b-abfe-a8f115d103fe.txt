Why is there a finite limit on the evaporation rate of a liquid at infinite temperature?
I am curious why there is a finite evaporation rate for any liquid at infinite temperature? The evaporation rate relates to the vapor pressure of a liquid as a function of the liquids temperature. This follows a exponential dependence at saturates to 1 at infinite temperature, implying that the vapor pressure also saturates at infinite temperature. This is based off the dependence observed from the Clausius Clapeyron Equation 

What is the physical interpretation of this finite limit to the vapor pressure of a liquid and thus its evaporation rate? Does the CC Equation not hold when approaching finite temperature? Is there something else that I am missing to explain this finite limit?

Note: this seems to still hold in a vacuum system (which is what I am working with). So I am unsure about the idea that this saturation comes from condensation
