What's the dumbest thing your Nfamily got mad at you for? Mine was for using the word HAMPER
Nsister yelled at me for using the word "hamper"




I literally just remembered this absurd "fight"

I was 13 or 14 at the time and my older sister who was TWICE my age at the time (she is 14 years older than me)  got mad at me because she didn't understand the word "hamper"

We don't speak English at home but it is one of my country's national languages and is the language of instruction in ALL SCHOOLS in ALL LEVELS.

My nMom told me to go looking for a hamper and she said it in our native language. But it's not even a word, it's a long phrase that describes what it is

"Thing we put dirty clothes in"

It's a mouthful

So I asked my sister since she was the last person I saw with the hamper

It went something like this



"Have you seen the hamper?" I said calmly

"WHATT?!?!?" Sister said shouting

"The hamper, have you seen it?"

"WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!?!?!"

"The hamper, Nmom is looking for it"

"WHAT THE F*CK IS A HAMPER?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"

"The thing we put dirty clothes in."

"THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY 'THE THING WE PUT DIRTY CLOTHES IN' WHY DO YOU HAVE TO RUB IT IN MY FACE THAT YOU'RE SO SMART, YOU'RE GOOD AT SPEAKING ENGLISH, THAT YOU THINK I'M SO DUMB. YOU'RE NOT REALLY EVEN SMART, YOU'RE JUST GOOD AT ENGLISH. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT ENGLISH BUT ARE DUMB AND YOU'RE ONE OF THEM. YOU'RE THE WORST AND I HATE YOU AND I WISH YOU GET RAPED WHEN YOU WALK OUT IN THE STREET AND THEN GET KILLED!!!!!"

My Nparents then barge into the room and get mad at ME because I'm being cocky about being smart and if I was really smart I wouldn't be cocky.

Then I got beaten with a belt and verbally dressed down by being called stupid, and r*tarded and a waste of space and that if I wasn't alive they'd be so better off financially


And my sister just watches this go down with a smug look on her face and then she threw the hamper at me saying

"Here's your *hamper*" she said dripping with malice

God, I hate my Nfamily.

On days when I feel guilty for hating them and fall for the gaslighting

I go back to these memories to keep me sane

They're the WORST.
