Remembered a very disappointing memory
I have been waking up at like 2 or 3 in the morning and struggling to get back to sleep. I decided I could use this time to explore my past traumas. 

This morning I remembered a day that dealt a serious blow to me. I was probably 17. At this point my mother's drug addiction made it so my dad had majority custody and my brother and I would visit  her every other weekend (assuming she wasn't in jail). She had been telling us how she had been sober for about 6 months and really felt bad for the major episode that resulted in her losing custody. Things were looking up.

 When we got there she was obviously high and had been awake for a couple days at least. Although I didn't let it show my disappointment was unbearable. It told me that she would always put drugs ahead of me. It reinforced my new idea that I wasn't good enough and that's why she chose drugs over me. And further, if I wasn't good enough for my mother how could i ever be good enough for anyone else? My trust issues likely stem from this day too. People will tell me whatever they think I want to hear to get what they want from me. And if my mom lies to me why wouldn't anyone else? 

Her addiction continued to spiral out of control. And layers of self loathing and distrust in others were added. But this was when I realized I can't trust anyone and that no one will really ever love me. I'm hopeful that me recognizing this somehow helps me process my feelings. Maybe even learn to move on from them.
