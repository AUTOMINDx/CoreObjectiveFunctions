I am attached to my parents.
I have a small issue. 
Since I was small, me and my parents used to do everything together, they were very young when they had me (around 23y), and they devoted all their time to me - a single child until I was 12yrs old (now 21). 

We went everywhere, we shared everything, they were always approachable and ready to listen. They helped me alot. I’ve become very independent and good with money, because of them. They are my bestfriends, and they don’t get mad for anything. 

Now the problem is, I get very sad, and very guilty when I cannot be with them for example for lunch, or if they go out for a trip or something. I have a full time job, I work late sometimes. They never made me feel guilty for not doing things with them. But it’s become a problem for me. I can’t go out, to lunch or whatever without feeling guilty. 

I am planning to move out soon, but i fear that I won’t be able to let go and will become homesick. Does anyone have any advice how to overcome this guilt?
