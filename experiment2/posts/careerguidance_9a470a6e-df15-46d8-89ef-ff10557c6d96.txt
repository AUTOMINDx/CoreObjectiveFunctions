Paying for someone to edit resume?
I am very busy and stressed and would live to pay someone to spruce up my resume and make it look nice and pretty. Is there any services you recommend for this? I know I can do it myself but I don’t mind laying a little bit of money to make my life easier (plus I don’t think I can do it as good as someone who does it professionally)
