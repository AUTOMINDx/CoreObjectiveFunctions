Scheduling class times that could potentially help me make friends but could potentially make me more annoyed
Im not sure what this post is. I guess I just wanted to tell someone but there isn't really someone irl i can tell.

I graduated high school in 2020, so I spent literally the entire first year at university in lockdown, virtual classes or both. I've drifted apart from the close friends I had in high school (some I just naturally drifted apart from, others moved countries). And needless to say I haven't made any new friends.

I'm scheduling next years classes and the main choices I have to make is there a few classes can be scheduled in places that would be inconvenient if I had no friends in that class but would be amazing if I did have friends there.

Best example of this is that I have a class that I can schedule for 11:30am to 2:30pm or a can schedule at a later more convenient time where I can have my lunch at around midday. Now, socially this is class creates a good opportunity in that I think 90%+ of the people in that class will be getting lunch right after which creates an easy way to socialise and get to know the other people (since we can get/eat lunch together. As opposed to the end of other classes where the majority of people will be going home or straight to other classes and the remainder won't invite you/want an invite to an activity by a random classmate). Best case scenario I end up having lunch at least once a week with a group of people after class and become friends with them. But worst case scenario I end up alone, hungry and inconvenienced by the fact that I have to wait until 2:30 to eat my lunch alone.

So I guess here's to hoping that my choice in class time works to my favour and I can make some friends.
