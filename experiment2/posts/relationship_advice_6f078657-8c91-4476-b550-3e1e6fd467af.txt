Girlfriend Sexually Assaulted
We met working at WalMart. I've since stopped working there after I left the overnight gig. She moved from Online Grocery to Overnight. 3 nights ago a guy I knew from that job twice and a precious employer as well groped my gf. 
I talked with the guy. It was pretty obvious he was lying he was super nervous etc etc. 
She told management and the guy is still being allowed to work there. She called Ethics and theyve submitted a complaint I highly doubt HR is gonna do anything ab it. No witnesses and he baited her into an area with no cameras. I wanna kill this fuck.
