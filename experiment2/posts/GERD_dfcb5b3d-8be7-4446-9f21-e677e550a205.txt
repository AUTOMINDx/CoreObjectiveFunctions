Heal my mild gerd?
So I’ve been having the symptoms for a few weeks now. Went to the doctors, got omeprazole. Everything was looking amazing for the past week, 0 symptoms.


On Saturday I decided to try bodybuilding again as I’d stopped it for the worry of reflux. It made my symptoms bad again. 

Do you think if I avoid the bad stuff like I was that my gerd will heal?
