Reoccurring jaundice
Hello! I’m 21F, ~120 pounds, 5’6, caucasian. I’ve been having a reoccurring   yellowing in the whites of my eyes and on my hands for the past 4 years at least. It’s been happening more often than it used to now. 

My bilirubin has been high at times, or at the border of high in all of my comprehensive metabolic blood tests. My AST(SGOT) has been high at times as well, but has also been normal other times. (Don’t know if these are related, but my potassium is frequently low as well, and my wbc is low or on the border of low frequently too) 

I get at least a little sun every day, it’s hard in the winter. But this occurs in the summer as well even when I’m getting a lot of sun. (Don’t know if this is relevant, I’ve just been asked about sun exposure before when I brought up the jaundice to a nurse). 

I can’t think of a trigger for it. Sometimes it reoccurs around my period. 

I have constant headaches, POTS, reynauds syndrome, stomach pain and bad bloating, rib pain (used to happen near my sternum with an enlarged intercostal space. Now reoccurs in my lower right ribs), hyper-flexible joints, frequent random bruising, and reoccurring skin rashes. I drink very infrequently and only a small amount, I did smoke cannabis frequently for almost year at a small amount but have since stopped. The yellowing predates both the drinking and smoking. I don’t do any other drugs. Current mediations include pregabalin 150 mg, claritin twice daily 10 mg, pepcid twice daily 20 mg, and multivitamin supplements. I just got off amitriptyline last week. 

I was just wondering if anyone had any idea what this could be? 

Sorry this was long
