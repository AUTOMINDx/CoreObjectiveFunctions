What is professionalism in engineering?
I’m a student in my senior year of ChE. A lot of different people have had a lot of different ideas on what constitutes professional behavior. I think I am starting to realize that this is just deeply linked to conformity and shame. Primarily for the purposes of motivating workers. Honestly, I want to be the best engineer I can be, and I try my hardest. It just feels like ‘professionalism’ is deeply subjective. Is this just about the working environment you end up in? How can I make sure my definition of professionalism is a good fit? At the end of the day, they would be paying me, unlike my profs, and it would probably be loads more bearable. 

Generally, I am also curious about how professionalism impacts things like safety, and has deeper impacts on engineering processes? Thanks in advance!
