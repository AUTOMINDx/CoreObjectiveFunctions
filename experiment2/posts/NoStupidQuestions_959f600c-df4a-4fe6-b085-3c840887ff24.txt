Are there any news sites or any publishers for politics that just show the facts of what actually happened instead of inserting political bias?
I am a junior in high school and I just recently started to take an interest in politics and i was wondering if anyone knew of someone who is at the very least in the middle and not on either side. This is not meant to be a huge political argument just a question but anything helps thanks.
