Which data set is most accurate with regards to Pakistan's PPP GDP Per Capita? I'm seeing a LOT of conflicting data.
[As you can see here, according to this infographic from the World Bank, India's Per Capita PPP GDP surpassed Pakistan only around the year 2009.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD?locations=IN-PK) 

However, when I look at data from 2005 on Wikipedia, I see that India's and Pakistan's Per Capita PPP GDP were $3,019 and $2,372, respectively. This data comes from the IMF. SOURCE:

So I'm thoroughly confused, and I'm also now suspicious about Pakistan's own Per Capita PPP GDP claims. [Here's a screenshot of the World Bank's own Per Capita PPP GDP data figures for India and Pakistan for August 2008, and it shows that India has a higher [figure for this.](https://imgur.com/cMWFZBv)

**What's going on with Pakistan's own Per Capita PPP GDP data and the World Bank's huge discrepancy here?**
