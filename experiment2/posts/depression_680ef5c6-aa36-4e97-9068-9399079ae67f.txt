Negativity is a fucking drug
The anger, the rage, the heartbreak, the anguish, the disappointment, the jealousy, the hatred, it’s all a fucking drug. Especially in this evil world that we live in, taken over by an evil species and run by evil people. I can’t look at the “beautiful side” of life without some horse shit getting shoved in my face constantly, without making mistake after mistake, without thinking about the evils that exist in this world. And I know that it’s all a mindset, but that’s the fucking issue, is that it’s fucking IMPOSSIBLE to break out of. You can’t say “I’m gonna stop doing crack today” and expect it to get magically better, and the same goes for negativity. First you find something negative in the world. You reject it, then accept it, then process it, then hate it, and the hatred feels awful. Eventually this happens so much that the hatred starts to feel… good. Like you want more hatred, more negativity, can’t live without it. Soon it starts to fester and bubble, and then grow and boil, until eventually all the pain and hatred that has been building up inside you bursts, and YOU FEEL ENRAGED AND YOU FEEL POWERFUL… until you realize that you hurt someone, most likely someone dear to you. You sink to your lowest possible state and begin feeling the most painful kind of negativity, and vow to stop this mindset. But it doesn’t stop, the process starts again, because you are human, and humanity as a species *thrives* on negativity. Yet in the end… it still hurts. 

My mom has told me I have a beautiful soul… I feel it fading. My dad has told me I have a heart of gold… I feel it disintegrating. All the love I have left in me… I feel it dying. 

Help me.
