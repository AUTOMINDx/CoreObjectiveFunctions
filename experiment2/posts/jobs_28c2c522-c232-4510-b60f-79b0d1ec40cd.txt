Is it okay to say that you’re looking for a higher salary during job interview?
I’m being underpaid by my current company. I love my job and the company but I need a higher salary. There’s no room for negotiation. The pay is a flat rate for the position I have. I’ve been contacted for first interviews by some companies— is it okay to say that I’m looking for a better pay when they ask why I’m looking for a new role? How else can I leverage why I’m planning to move on?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your feedback! I’m still very early in my career which is why I wanted to make sure I don’t make a mistake during the process. I’ve only been at my current company for less than half a year. Which is why I don’t want to stay any longer with a low salary when I know my worth it much more considering how much other companies are paying for the same position I’m in. Fingers crossed I find a great opportunity!
