Experience taking meds??
Hello! I wanna hear some stories and experience on managing this with meds (+therapy). 

I've decided to try meds out after giving it a lot of thought. I used to take escitalopram (for 2 years) but it stopped working and had to quit it and it was hell (I have awful withdrawal symptoms for like a month) I'm scared because of this experience, but also I'm tired of being so anxious all the time and not being able to go out. I think I need something to lessen the anxiety a little bit ðŸ˜­. I'm going to therapy (before I only took meds and didn't went to therapy at all) so I'm hopeful that therapy+meds will make me live a better life. But also I'm scared of side effects or developing dependency ðŸ¥². 

I'm looking forward to read you guys experiences!
