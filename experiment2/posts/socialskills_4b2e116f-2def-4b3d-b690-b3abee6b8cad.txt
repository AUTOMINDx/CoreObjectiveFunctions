Should I even respond?
I was texting this guy who I met on Tinder. We were talking about how we both liked art. And he said he had tickets to this art exhibit. I asked him who he was going with. He said he wasn't sure and would maybe give the tickets to his mom and boyfriend. So I said I think we should meet at the exhibit and he never replied this was in September. And today he replied with this should I even reply?
