What's a cool chemical reaction involving a catalyst?
I've looked at /r/chemicalreactiongifs but it's a little sparse. There's [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemicalreactiongifs/comments/e2ak0f/zinc_pyrotechnics_one_with_ammonium_chloride_as_a/), but I'd be more interested in a reaction where the catalyst is dropped in or is visually interesting as it's added (followed by some type of visually dramatic reaction).
