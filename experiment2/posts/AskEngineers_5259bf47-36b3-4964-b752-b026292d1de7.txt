Early career choices, two companies, two different lines of work.
Hi All, 

I'm a MS Mechanical Engineering student soon to graduate, my late career fair experience was great and I managed to secure a Co-op in a multinational F500 company in Indiana. Salary and Benefits are great, the only catch is that it'll be completely remote...bummer.

On the other hand, I've been lucky enough to advance to the 4-people interview with the team I'd be working on for a full-time Production/Mechatronics engineer role in CT, this would NOT delay my MS Graduation and I'd join them as soon as I get my degree (\~May '22).

So one role offers a Co-op which delays my MS graduation to December 2022 and is fully remote. Work there is mostly Mechanical/Thermal engineering with support to current products (Diesel engines) and basically, a step under R&amp;D from what I understand, while the other opportunity is a Full-Time in CT as a Mechatronics/Production engineer in a photolithography company that's also international. This later position would involve a lot of troubleshooting and it'll be in the production-manufacture area with alleged opportunities to grow if one chooses to move to a different country.

I know I shouldn't take the second opportunity for granted, since I'll have the interview whilst the first option was already offered. But I'm worried, as a graduate, to truncate my future career by choosing between two very different Industries so early on.

Furthermore and finally, I am really keen and interested in both companies, and have been for a while, so I am confused and full of anxiety regarding my potential best option and not blowing it out with either company.  

I write this post seeking advice from more knowledgeable Engineers who aren't as green as me regarding the aforementioned situation.
