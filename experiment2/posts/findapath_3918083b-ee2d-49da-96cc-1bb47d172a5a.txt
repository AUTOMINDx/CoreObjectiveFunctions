Is this FOMO?
I wonder what could have happened if I wasn’t working. Every time I go out for lunch, I’ll always see people doing their own stuff, but then there I am, where I have to go back to the office to do shit. 

Yeah I’m currently in a job that I hate too, as a newcomer accountant (only started this job a month ago). And then when I leave work… When I got out, I can see how the sun shines so brightly and I wonder what I could’ve been doing if I wasn’t working. 

I could have been cycling or hiking or doing whatever. 

I feel like ever since I started working, I’ve been missing out a lot. 40+ hours of my time, at least, are taken up. Why? Because I’m working for someone and chasing their dreams. 

What about mine? 

I know we work for survival, but is there any other way? My future is so bleak right now. I can’t work for another day, I feel like shit anyway.

Also I’ve been thinking of leaving accounting after a month. I’ve been unemployed since I graduated around August 2020. This is my first job, I joined since late October 2021. I’ll probably leave like February? Idk.

If I leave like now, then this job… Is not gonna appear on my resume? But like to hell with all this resume shit. Honestly. There’s gotta be something more. 

Is there not? I really want to start a business. I’ll work part time minimum wage jobs while I do my business? At least it’s part time and I’ll have more autonomy and work lesser days? Anyways, idk, I still can’t figure it out yet but I’m just thinking of this direction. I just hate the office and working so DAMN much. 

Please advice. Thank you in advance.
