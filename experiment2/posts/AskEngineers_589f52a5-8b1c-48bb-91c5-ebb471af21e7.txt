Should I take a job offer for slightly more money and jump ship on my current team? Please help!!!
Hi all,

I got offered a job that entails a 2k raise with OT at a large consulting firm. My current job I have been at for only a little over a year, but I'm doing great. I have lots of responsibility and am gaining respect in the team as they are trusting me with more tasks. 

That being said, the job is kind of boring (huge utility company). This new job entails more field work, and really cool projects in the MEP domain. I would get to see the fruits of my labor every day through my community. The issue is, it will likely be more intense as my current gig is pretty stress free and easy overall (low pay though).

I feel guilty because I do have great managers who seem to care and they are clearly investing more in me. That being said, when I asked about promotions they got wishy washy and didn't really give me an answer other than "hard workers should progress further than those who do not show initiative." Which is great, but I am trying to make a good living for my future family. They are already planning on my role to take over new responsibility and more projects. 

Another point is my current role is in natural gas. I am skeptical of the future considering the country's push towards "cleaner" energy infrastructure. 

I weighed out pros and cons and it's a tough choice. I don't want to be a victim of "the grass is always greener" syndrome. 

Tldr: do I take a job for a marginal pay raise and more interesting work, and screw over my current team? Or do I stay put for another year and give it another chance?
