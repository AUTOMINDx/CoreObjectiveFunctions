Brother Tests Positive Same Day I Recieve Booster
Physicians/Medical Community of Reddit,

I received my Moderna booster shot on 11/30, exactly 6 months after my last vaccine from same company.

I am 14 hours post-vaccine and I am experiencing small grade fever, chills, nausea, and I am having musculoskeletal pain over every part of my body, pretty much.

Two days pre-booster shot I felt kind of ‚Äúoff‚Äù but not in any covid having-symptomatic way; largely, it felt like the lymph nodes in my neck were swollen (you know that feeling you get where right before you throw up, it feels like you have tonsils again?). I chalked it up to anxiety and went on with my booster.

Today, my (unvaccinated) brother went to ER and tested positive for the virus. My question to you, dear medical community, how does having the booster given to me while being already potentially being infected with the virus work? Am I at higher risk for these symptoms I‚Äôm having, or higher risk for COVID complications?

I had C19 in December last year, got vaccinated with the last one being at the end of May, had a breakthrough case in August. I‚Äôd imagine I‚Äôm pretty well protected but I am just concerned considering I did get the booster.

TL;DR

Brother went to ER and tested positive the same day I received my booster (post booster) and I am worried what this means as far as booster/virus interaction if I do have an active infection. Words of wisdom?

Thank you üôè
