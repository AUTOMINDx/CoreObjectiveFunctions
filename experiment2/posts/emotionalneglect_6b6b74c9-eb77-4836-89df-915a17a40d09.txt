Hate the holidays
This is just a long rant sorry.

I don't know why my family even acknowledge me during thanksgiving. The moment I come home, they expect me to shuffle into my childhood bedroom while they have guests over. But every time I poke my head out or go get something to eat or drink... suddenly I'm the butt of the jokes. ahhhh here's weird sheepflakes. Why don't you ever stay down here LOL. Do you know sheepflakes dropped out of XYZ prestigeious school? omg, what a mistake! Now they're getting a degree in a lower-level career!! eww!!

It sucks so much. My friends are all busy with their loved ones, and so I am just here alone in my room, wondering why do I even try anymore. Sometimes, I consider just deleting my social media and completely vanishing from my family and friends' lives. I genuinely feel like no one would notice or care to ask.

Aside from Christmas, the next 'holiday' I guess is my birthday. I hated my birthdays because my parents would refuse to celebrate it on the actual day because 'auntie can't come during that day' or 'we're too busy to celebrate it.' When I have free time, and they don't want to celebrate it at all. There is this restaurant I really enjoy going to. I go there every year, it reminds me of a simpler time of my childhood. But now I'm getting texts and pushback from family about how no one likes eating there. That I should consider their needs when I celebrate my literal birthday.

I'm so confused why I am always a second priority to my family. I don't understand what I have done to deserve this. Now, I have to sort this all out in therapy, because my family thinks I'm the weird broken one in the family. When they have done this to me. It sucks so much.
