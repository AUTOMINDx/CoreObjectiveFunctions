Does anyone find the idea of death comforting?
Not in a suicidal I want to die way. I don't really want to die right now but the fact that I am going to die one day gives me comfort. Like I won't exist anymore. Nothing I did will matter. No more worries. No more pain. I don't really believe in afterlife so what I think there is after we die is just nothing. Wrapped up by eternal darkness. And after enough time no one will remember you existed. It will be like you were never there. I don't know it's weird or morbid but I find comfort in the fact that I am not gonna be permanent. My whole existence is all but a footprint on sand. Does anyone else feel this way?
