Can’t stand my lazy pathetic ass
I can’t help but look around at all of the people on tv, media, etc who actually fucking did something with their lives while I’m over here sitting on my fat ass only doing what is easy and the moment something comes up that actually takes effort I say NOPE! I will live a life of mediocrity without contributing a damn thing that matters and it’s all my fault. I’m painfully aware of the truth but sit in my comfort zone anyway while feeling sorry for myself. I know I have potential, and it will be wasted.
