Family abuse system
I went through a traumatizing experience and it turns out my family was the group of people thst paid for it the whole time. I don't k know how to get away from them and this has been happening for many years now and apparently has connections to people like Weinstein. Very, very abusive and everytime I try to get away I am followed and abused(incest is a problem) I am a grown up but I have been drugged and abused for so long now I am almost out of hope. I was kidnapped in Maine and taken to machias, Maine and the men from there have been following me everywhere I go with the help of the police who are paid by the mob in my town so when I even try to stay out past 11 pm try they threaten me with the police. I cannot tell you how much pain I have experienced. No one should have a family like this and the support network I once had is gone. I don't want suicide to be my only option for survival but when my cousin did this to me in college it seemed like that was the only way out. Does anyone know of a group or network that helps cult victims? Tucson is one of the most abusive, sadistic places I have ever been and it might actually have something to do with a saw satanic cult that meets near gates pass....they think new strength and energy comes from sucking it out of someone and electrocuting them. They even call it a booty bust like it's normal.
