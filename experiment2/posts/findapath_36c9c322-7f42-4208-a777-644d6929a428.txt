Career Change
Stuck in a hard spot. 

I'm 36. 

Currently in my 6th year as a police telecoms operator (911), so I'm a federal government employee under the Public Service. Lateral transfers are possible but not appealing. ( Canada Revenue Agency , Service Canada, etc , all call center work dealing with irate people). I make $70k/year with excellent benefits. 

I've been diagnosed with PTSD as a result of my job and for my own health I can't remain in this line of work much longer.  I've spent 15 years of my working life to date working in some form of customer service (call centers) and I'm really ready to take on something that does not deal with the public. 

I have ADHD and Dyscalculia, and have no formal post secondary education. No certifications or marketable skills (on paper).

I've been actively browsing job ads for the last two years and I don't qualify for any jobs above minimum wage, and all of them are customer service / retail. 

My wife works in insurance and her agency has an opening for a data entry clerk, with benefits and the ability to work from home 50% of the time. It pays only half of my current salary. 

Just wondering if anyone is in this same boat or has some insight on how to climb out of this hole. Being learning disabled and pushing 40 has really closed a lot of doors and I'm really worried that I'll end up losing my house. Anyone with experience in finding a path later in life? Especially being neuro-divergent?
