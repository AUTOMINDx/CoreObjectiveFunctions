Divorce - soon to be ex husband wants half equity of home. His name is not on the papers
Offered to buy him out. He typically paid down payments and I would take care of living expenses. He wants half equity of home after sale even though he also did not help with the down payment. What would be the most appropriate course of action if bad blood is not wanted?


Edit FYI asking on behalf of someone

Edit wow this place b toxic. I’m glad I’m asking for them ahah.

Edit: neither party identifies as women so y’all need to check in with your misogyny lol
