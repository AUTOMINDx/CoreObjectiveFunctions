Can anyone help
Hi, so basically I've been very alone for the last 4 months. It started when I was travelling to much and wasn't being home as much anymore. I started becoming more rude to my friends and eventually on school holidays I was nocturnal and didn't really talk. Now I'm trying to come back but I'm so lost I don't know where to start. All my opinions on things have changed so I can't remember the things that made me happy.
