Pisces &amp; Sagittarius - Initial Attraction turns into Friction
I'm a Pisces, and I have had a few Sagittarian friends or lovers in the past. It always starts with a shared enthusiasm about everything and we usually like each other a lot. Then, there is always a switch, and the Sagittarius has a capacity for intensity in the relationship (platonic or not) that I don't - e.g. seeing each other all the time, being "best friends" right away, or rushing into saying "I love you". I'm much slower with my intensity and it takes me a long time to trust people. If I pull away (even w the intent to return), the Sag gets upset or spiteful - the worst I've heard is "your boundaries are unhealthy". They said this when I finally asked for space after the conflict in our years-long friendship became too much for me. We never spoke again. 

I'm sure this has to do with more than just sun signs, but it seems like this hot-to-cold relationship is a pattern for me (as well as a few other Pisces friends who I spoke with) in regards to relationships with Sagittarians. It doesn't happen so distinctly with other signs. With Sag's, it's like clockwork. 

For reference, if it matters: I have Merc in Aquarius, Venus in Cap, Mars in Leo.
