Tactile hallucinations everynight :( is there anyway to stop them???
I'm aware that it's not real but that doesn't change that i can still feel it... even if it doesn't actually hurt it hurts so badly. Every physical touch can trigger it even my clothes and talking them off just makes it worse. It always happens when I'm in bed about to fall asleep. (The traumatic things would happen and wake me up durring my sleep)

I don't know what to do, its starting to really become unbearable. I don't have money for a therapist, pls tell me there is something i can do.
