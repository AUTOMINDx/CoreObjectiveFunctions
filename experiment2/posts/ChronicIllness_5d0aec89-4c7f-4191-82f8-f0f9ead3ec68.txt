Finally got a rheumatology referral.
I've been to my normal doctor over and over the last two years with frequent respiratory illness, going to a GI and a pulmonary specialist, and after coming in about joint inflammation and pain, I got a referral!

I just hope this is close to me finding the answers to my issues, but I'll find out soon enough.
