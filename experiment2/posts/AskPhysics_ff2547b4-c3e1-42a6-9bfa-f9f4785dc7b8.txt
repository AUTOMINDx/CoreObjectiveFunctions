Does having low EMF matter in the context of infrared saunas?
There is a lot of fuss about infrared sauna with too much EMF being bad for health. Not sure if there is any legitimacy to it, or if it's tin foil hat level stuff. Isn't EMF literally exactly what infrared is? Would having a low EMF infrared sauna just mean it's not heating you up as quickly? Would that just be having a low powered sauna?
