How long does omeprazole/Prilosec work for you?
I know it says its supposed to stop the acid production for 24 hours but I seem to be getting more acid production a lot sooner than that. Just wondering if it lasts all day for you guys? Is it possible it’s stopping working? I’ve only been on it a couple months.
