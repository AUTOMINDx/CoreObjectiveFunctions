Is it possible to turn your depression into a high functioning one?
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to get better and not be depressed at all and actually start enjoying life but the possibility of that seems very dim now, especially given that I've been on many medications and been to therapy for years now and none of them have worked. The thing is I can no longer afford to live with depression which makes me pretty much defunct. I want to earn some money and leave enough for my single mom(uneducated, we're from a third world country) and finally die and be free from this misery. But my depression is slowing the whole thing down, I'm bedridden for weeks on end and that isn't helping at all. 

I'm okay with hating every second of my life and wanting to die as long as I'm functioning well on the outside and making money. So, how do I go about that? I also get easily fatigued whenever I'm able to get up and do some chores, let alone do anything productive. I also think depression has badly fucked my executive functioning up. Are there any medications that can help you function better without getting unbearably tired. Please help.
