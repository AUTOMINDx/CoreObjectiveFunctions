I just found out some interesting family history about my grandparents on my mother's side
So apparently, my grandfather was first married to my grandmother's paternal aunt (which at the time, would have made him my grandmother's uncle through marriage). My grandfather had two children with my grandmother's aunt. My grandmother's aunt passed away at a young age subsequently making my grandfather a widower. Two years after her death, my grandfather married my grandmother and together, they had three children (including my mother).  My mother's parents passed away before I was born so I never knew this. My mom told me that she never referred to her older two siblings as half siblings or cousins because they were all raised in the same household. What would my exact blood relationship be to my mom's oldest siblings?
