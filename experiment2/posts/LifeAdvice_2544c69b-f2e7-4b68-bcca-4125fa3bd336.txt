Money exchange from the US to Canada on a private purchase.
Im ordering some small parts from a private seller that happens to live in Canada and i am located in the southern US. The exchange rate is $USD to $CD 1=1.28. How would I go about paying for my parts? I've never ordered anything from outside the country what do i need to do?
