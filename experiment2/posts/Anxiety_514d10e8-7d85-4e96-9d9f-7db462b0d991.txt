Love yourself!
I wanted to share some positivity and a helpful tip from a therapist I really needed to hear. It’s so easy to get anxious and blame yourself for it, or think negative thoughts about it, wishing it would just go away etc. The lack of appetite I get from anxiety really does piss me off because I’ve been trying to gain weight and I dislike my body. I really hit the rock bottom couple weeks ago and had to get help finally. I didn’t even realized how negatively I’ve been thinking of myself all the time, when my body has just signaled me to calm down and take better care of myself. I started to think like wow, I’ve done so many things this year like moving on my own for the first time and didn’t give myself enough credit for it. Always just thought about what was bad in my life and what I wanted to change. When I realized the lack of self love I really had an epiphany, and now slowly and steadily trying to get better by loving myself. Hope this can help someone, give yourself enough credit for all the hard things you’ve endured ❤️
