I can't stand other people's successes, I have taken a break off the discord server because of that, all because i can't stand seeing the successes of others and my intense frustration for not getting a job after a whole year of theraphy, networking, referrals...
I've tried everything. Only send resumes for vacancies that match my profile. Send resume to everything and everyone. It only gave interviews that led to nowhere, or worse job offers than my current job, with no stability at all. I hate working where I work. I have debts to pay. Put me in the dismayed stat. I'm tired of it all. I'll never look for a job again, I'll work in the same place my whole life until I'm seventy years old and then stay holed up at home until I die. There's no hope for me, a year's hard looking for a job to no avail. Having hope didn't do any good. Indications, to no avail. Networking didn't do any good. I don't even know who I should blame, or if this will be helpful. I just know that I no longer have the strength to continue this frantic job search.

I think I'll make some huge poster with my resume short and go downtown. Does it seem that this is the only way to get a place in Brazil? Where are the vacancies that businesspeople keep crying that they can't fill? Or do they just want perfect unicorns that they can pay little for what the professional is worth? Bunch of a\*\*sholes. They killed, chopped and burned my dreams, my hopes, my desires to give a better life to my parents who suffered so much to be who they are and to be able to give me an education.

I can see that I'm going to be an engineer that does uber fares for the rest of his life. Damn world. I am doomed to fail, to never be able to exercise what I attended. It's over. I'm despondent.
