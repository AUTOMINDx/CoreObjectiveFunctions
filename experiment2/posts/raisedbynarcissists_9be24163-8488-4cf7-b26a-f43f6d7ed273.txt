My mom is a narcissist with a martyr complex
She is not diagnosed or anything. She went to a psychiatrist once because of her "lazy family" driving her nuts but when the conversation turned to what she didn't like (aka she might be suffering from something), she quit.

She sacrifices herself constantly but she doesn't do it for others; she does it because she wants everyone else to feel guilty and have a sense of people owing her. As a child I would be told by her constantly that she did SO MUCH for me and how she sacrificed everything for me and that she neeeever asked anything in return (which is a lie, she always wants something in return, but nothing is ever good enough to "pay the debt").

Today I was at dinner with my parents. I don't live at home anymore and we sometimes invite each other to dinner. I asked if there was anything I could do to help but she said no. Then at the end of the dinner she started scolding me for disappearing whenever something needed to be done, that she has done SO MUCH for me, I never did anything in return, I was ungrateful, I would never survive without her helping me and that I never gave her anything, etc. She ended up yelling that I had a lot of paying back to do and that she expects me to be ready first thing in the morning to pay back. (And nomatter what I do tomorrow I will still owe her for the rest of my life in her eyes)

It was a total rookie mistake to not help even though she told me I shouldn't. I hate myself most for falling for that old trick. Again.

Anyone else with a parent whom is a narcissist with a martyr complex? I feel so alone.

And how do I stop blaming myself for falling for those tricks? I just hate myself and know I will have a shitty week because I didn't see it coming.
