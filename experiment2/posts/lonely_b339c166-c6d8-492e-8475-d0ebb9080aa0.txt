I wish I had a best friend 37/M
It's been years since I had a best friend. I just want someone I can chill with on the couch and watch movies or tv or just go walking on trails with or camping or even an online friend that I can talk with, share memes, tell jokes, be a shoulder to cry on etc.

I would prefer having a female friend due to past trauma..if your a dude and message me though, I'll try my best not to be awkward or weird.

A few tidbits about me: I like anime (watching cowboy bebop for the first time!), reading (reading a halo series book), playing games on my pc (again halo, factorio, the division 2, duke nukem series) amateur programmer (C#, JS), and I love jazz. 

I'm pretty laid back but I always strive to be honest about everything.
