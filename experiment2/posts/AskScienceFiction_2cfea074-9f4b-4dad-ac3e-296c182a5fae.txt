[Pibby] How did Pibby and company manage to trespass Nickelodeon?
In the concept trailer, there are brief scenes that it seems they had been in "Rocko's Modern Life" and "SpongeBob SquarePants".

What would be the possible scenario that they managed to cross to another channel in order to escape from the glitched entity?
