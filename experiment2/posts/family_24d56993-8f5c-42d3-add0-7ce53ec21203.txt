Grandmother passed away
My grandmother who lives in Poland has just passed away today, we weren’t the closest but we still loved each other, I know that if she didn’t live in a different continent we would be a lot closer but I haven’t seen her in a few years and I hadn’t talked to her in like 3 months, I just wish I was able to talk to her again or see her once again. Her and my grandfather were supposed to come stay with us for three months on the 14th of December and I was excited to see them again after a while but I just couldn’t believe it when I heard she had a heart attack. She had a heart attack two days ago and she didn’t wake up and just today she died. I have never lost a close family member so I don’t really know how to react right now but I just keep thinking about all the memories I had of coming to Poland every other summer seeing her and she would always be so nice to me and make the best food and now while writing this it’s really hit me and I just keep crying now. I wish I could see her one more time.
