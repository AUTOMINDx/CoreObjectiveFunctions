Getting Over Insecurities
Hey everyone, 

I’m going to try and make this short, but as detailed as possible.  

I am currently married to my husband of 11 years and we have two kids together.  I am 31 years old and I am tired of feeling so insecure about myself.  My insecurities are holding me back from making friends and being my best self, but I can’t seem to overcome them. 

Backstory:

My parents divorced when I was around 6 years old.  My dad and I were close until he remarried.  My stepmom and I didn’t get along and my dad ended up breaking off his relationship with me when I was 12.  We haven’t spoke in almost 20 years.  This is probably where it all started.  
Fast forward to my first relationship.  It was in high school, but it was my first love and I was all in.  Unfortunately for me he wasn’t and he cheated on me multiple times.  This went on for a few years.  
Then I met my now husband and he has always been good to me.  However,  I have always felt threatened and worried he too will eventually move on to someone else.  It bothers me so much I will literally stonewall girls from being my friend because I don’t want them around him.  I clearly have abandonment issues and am insecure I just don’t know how to get over them.  I want to have girl friends and not constantly worry that they are just trying to get with my husband or that he will get with them.  I know it’s all in my head but it’s been going on for to long now and I need change.  

I’m looking for advice or maybe even book recommendations.


Thanks.
