Needing a friend or friend group
I'll start with venting/the back story and then explain what I'm hoping for.

Backstory: I have PTSD not from the military or some one off event. Mine is from psychological abuse from one of my parents. The focus was always on how I would never be good enough. I went to art school for 9 years. I have two art degrees, but I had countless panic attacks and even blackouts of time from the stress. I even failed full semesters as a result of my poor mental health. The anxiety and pressure is still overwhelming and prevents me from even attempting to do art of any kind. I want a job in the field I studied for, but most of my portfolio is over 10 years old.

Recently, I've restarted doing EMDR and I'm trying to work through the anxiety to just create or even color. I also am going to try my hand at bullet journaling. I don't intend it to be artsy, but using the minimalist aspect to try and not feel overwhelmed. 

Hope: My hope is to find people who can understand my situation, help gently encourage me or just send positive vibes. Another thought is send art back and forth or just talk about fun ideas ... or just a friend.

I can tell my anxiety is getting really bad, but I also want to make progress. Solitude and being stuck in my own head isn't helping.

If you've read this far, feel free to DM me. Thank you all for being amazing people.
