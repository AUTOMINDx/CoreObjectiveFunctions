[UT] Anybody ever used a current supervisor as a reference for a new higher paying job?
One public sector entity I worked for in education had a 'wink, wink, nod, nod' agreement that any supervisor could veto any job hire/transfer within the entity if you were deemed too essential because of what you were doing. Happens to me every time.
