WORSE heartburn from PPI?!
I cannot make sense of this. I'm a month in on 40 mg per day of Omeprazol + 20 mg of Pepcid at night. My LPR symptoms are vastly improved. No more "asthma", no more sinus problems, no waking up choking at night, no burning mouth and mouth dryness, nothing. Excellent. 

However, if I falter at all from my extremely reflux safe diet of mostly chicken, fish, overcooked veg and the occasional bowl of oatmeal - I get heartburn so bad it feels like lava. Like the worst most painful heartburn ever. Also experiencing some globus at night. Much much worse heartburn than when I was completely off meds and struggling with horrendous LPR symptoms instead. How on earth can this be? Has anyone experienced anything similar? I don't want to stop the meds because waking up choking at night was definitely not fun and the meds have made so many of the LPR complaints completely disappear but this pain is making me so depressed and anxious and honestly frightened at times.
