Good Publication of Nietzsche?
I’m new to philosophy and i’d like to start with Nietzche and looking at beyond good and evil (unless you think I should start with another of his work). 

The problem is that i’m looking on amazon and a large number of reviews complain about the translation or the poor formatting of the book. 

Is there any agreement about what the best publication/translation is?
