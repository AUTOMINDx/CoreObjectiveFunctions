Soldering in a dorm with windows that donâ€™t open
Would you recommend wearing a respirator for soldering in an enclosed space? I have a fan and an air purifyer, but I feel like that may not be enough. How dangerous are the fumes from leadless solder? Thanks!

Edit: electronics noob here- soldering wire is actually 60/40 tin-lead
