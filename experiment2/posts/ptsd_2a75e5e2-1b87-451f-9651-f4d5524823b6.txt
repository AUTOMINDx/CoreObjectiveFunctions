Facebook free for two weeks
My PTSD symptoms have greatly improved since. That constant FOMO and jealousy that builds looking at everyone’s holiday posts has dissolved away….it’s really helping me stay off my phone as much and be more present. (Reddit is my 2nd addiction but that’s for another day lol). 

Just wanted to share in case anyone is considering cutting the FB cord!
