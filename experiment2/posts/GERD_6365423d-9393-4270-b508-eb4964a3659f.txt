5-HTP instead of melatonin
Hi everyone.

So 2 weeks ago out of nowhere I started getting GERD symptoms. It started with frequent heart burn, then globus sensation and now excess saliva production.

I've not been to a doctor yet but I have been lurking here and reading some studies. One study I found was the seemingly positive impact melatonin can have on GERD symptoms by strengthening the LES.

Since I'm UK based melatonin is not something I can get OTC. And since 5-HTP is involved in the production of melatonin in the body, I wanted to ask if anyone had had any luck taking the 5-HTP to instead.

I do want to say that I have bought other supplements as yet to arrive, namely: DGL Licorice, L-Glutamine and Apple cider vinegar gummies.

I also took cetirizine for the globus sensation and it helped massively.

I just want to sure up my resources to deal with this sudden problem before it becomes chronic. I'm also in the process of making the necessary dietary changes. 

TIA
