Tired
My mental health has been up and down for a few years and I always thought i’d get better but i’ve only really gotten worse.

It affects everything but most importantly, my work life. I can’t work or keep a job and I don’t feel like there’s a way out. i’ve had 4 mental breakdowns so far at work and i’ve only been working there for 4 months. 

I feel like everything is wrong with me. Why can’t i just get on with work like everyone else, like I know people don’t like working but they can suck it up so why can’t I. There’s so much pressure to be so great at my job but also at life but i’m failing at everything. 

I even called the Doctor yesterday and told them that i’m trying but I really don’t know how long I can keep trying for because my soul feels so drained and exhausted. Essentially, I was told that a referral would be made and they were sorry I felt that way. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, i’m going through 100 emotions at once and no emotion at the same time and I just want my mind to stop but it won’t.
