“everyone has something they care about more than you.” I saw this on a Reddit post and it seriously has me questioning my value to the world
I have no family, having grown up in foster care. I haven’t been able to make any friends where I’m living. Even in my relationships it occurred to me early on that I will never be as important as a child a parent, a family member or a project.

I feel like I’m always destined to be alone. I don’t see the point of contributing anything anymore. Everyone has something they care about more than me and they always will.

I don’t know what it’s like to be truly valued by another person. I probably never will. 

I can’t wait to spend Christmas and New Years alone.
