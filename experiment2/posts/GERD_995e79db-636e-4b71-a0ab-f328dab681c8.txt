Anyone's nausea resolved by surgery?
The most debilitating GERD symptom that I have is nausea. I never actually vomit, but I just get this debilitating nausea that keeps me bedridden... Tried ppi's, Reglan, Zofran, and a bunch of supplements. Anyone's nausea resolved by Nissen/LINX/any other GERD surgery?
