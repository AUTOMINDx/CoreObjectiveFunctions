Why are heroes so often written to never kill?
I'm not saying I support people in real life offing each other but in TV shows and especially anime you have like literal demons and incarnations of the devil, and the hero refuses to kill because of some moral code authors think heroes have to abide by?

When I first started watching arrow I thought it was interesting/unique that he had a different approach. That didn't last long.

This type of morality often causes major issues, and far more deaths than would ever have happened if the bad guy didn't exist.

Why is this such a common trait of heroes? Why do so many authors subscribe to this specific model of heroism?
