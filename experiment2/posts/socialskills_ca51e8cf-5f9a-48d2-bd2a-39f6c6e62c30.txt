finding it hard to connect to men
I’m 22F in engineering. Yes, it’s a male dominated field but I’m still having trouble connecting or bonding with my group members (all guys). They are smart, funny and reliable people from the three months of group work we have done. 

My main concern is how do I connect with guys. I find it hard. I genuinely try to be myself only to find myself really anxious and sometimes seeking their validation, which is wrong. Idk guys in general intimidate me, not that these guys are bad. I’m usually an emotional and sensitive person so anytime I bring something up, I hear responses like “it’s not that deep” or “you’re taking this too far” or sometimes I feel unheard, especially when interrupted. 

Let me know if you need me to explain more.
