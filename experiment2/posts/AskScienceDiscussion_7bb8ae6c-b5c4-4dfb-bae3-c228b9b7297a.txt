Can you hide something in (near-earth) space?
I'm writing a story and thought about Cold War era secret doomsday program where Soviets sent and hid something in space that's there till today. Like an end-of-world weapon or even a small space base with cosmonauts. 

Would that stretch imagination too much and where would be most logical place to hide something like this? Like dark side of the moon or something? Or is it totally impossible and we would have totally detected anything of sort in reasonable distance?
