I’m scared that I’ve become too comfortable in my loneliness.
I’m a 17 year old with a few friends and I have almost adapted to being happy in my loneliness. When I’m alone I genuinely feel okay and that I’m fine with it. But sometimes there are instances where I get so low I start asking myself “How can you just be so okay with this ?”. I wish I had someone who could just hold me and tell me that it’s alright and there’s nothing wrong with me.
