Predictions for Christmas
I'll go to my sister's house with my family, drink, eat and have fun. I may talk more then usual, feel hopeful and alive. Then I'll come home. A bit drunk, I will enter my room, turn off the lights and lay in bed. At this point I'll remember that I'm alone. Most people are either still drinking and having fun or are going to bed with someone that they care. At this point I'll pick up my phone. If life wants to be a bit sarcastic, there will be a notification. For a spam email. I go to sleep. If I'm lucky, I will dream about a cute girl, kissing and cuddling, not much more. Then I'll wakeup, and have to face reality. And this will repeat in the new years eve. And then next year, again and again.
