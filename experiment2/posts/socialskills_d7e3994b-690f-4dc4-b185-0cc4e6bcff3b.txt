How do you back out of plans you agreed to doing?
Some of my friends and I had planned to go to a holiday event on Saturday. Even though we had made these plans weeks ago I am just not feeling up to going anymore. The event is over an hour away from my home and it doesn't seem like something I want to do now. I would rather do something else instead, like just go out to dinner. One of my other friends feels the same way and she is hoping someone else will cancel. But I feel like just being direct and telling our friends now- rather than wait until the last minute- that I no longer can make it. At the same time I don't want to come across as a flake. Any advice on what a good reason would be not to go?
