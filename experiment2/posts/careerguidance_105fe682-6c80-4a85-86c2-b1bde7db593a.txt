Paramedic Now, What Next?
Hey all.

Currently a 24-year-old Paramedic working for AMR in California. So far, I really do love Paramedicine. I started in EMS as an EMT in 2016. I was an eighteen year old with no clue what I wanted to do after high school, something about getting to drive an ambulance sounded really cool. Fast forward some years I spent working as a Basic, and I was fortunate enough to receive a free sponsorship from the company I worked for. I got my Paramedic school paid for and left that company to work for AMR after they were bought by another company (they only did IFT).

I've been a full-time medic now for a year and some change in a busy system, and like most people I like being a Paramedic, but the longevity of this job I am seeing more short term for now. I do have all my general education complete with a community college, but never claimed a major. I have never had a job outside of EMS.

So at this point, I have entertained the idea of going the fire route to advance my career but in all honesty I don't know if I'm "cut out" for it being that I have a crippling fear of heights (sounds kinda silly, I know). Flight medic also sounds attractive, but I'm unsure of how competitive that will be, and I'm a little scared of helicopter crashes. Nursing has never really attracted me as I don't like the idea of being in a hospital constantly and dealing with the massive amounts of charting, following only specific orders and the lack of "autonomy" that we medics get to feel (guide me if there's options in nursing I should look at). I do however, already have some classes that would be required to go the RN route (statistics, anatomy, communications) under my belt. More recently, I have considered Ultrasound Technician because there seems to be a decent level of pay in that which I won't be getting as an AMR medic.

Really looking for some solid advice as I feel like I need some guidance, thank you.
