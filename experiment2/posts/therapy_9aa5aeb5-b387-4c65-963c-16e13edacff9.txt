Is it normal that my first therapy session has exhausted me?
I had my first therapy session this week and ever since I feel so drained, exhausted, I just want to lay in silence and collect my thoughts. I’ve never experienced this before, I have work and university commitments and I haven’t attended any because I am mentally drained. Is this somewhat normal? I feel like a failure for taking time out but I have experienced trauma from childhood to adulthood and never opened up about it. It’s hitting me like a drug comedown or hangover etc.
