What are jobs to build a future in this economy
Im mid 20s. I don't have a life calling or some type of career interest. I have an associates in Drafting and Design but that only gets you low level drafting jobs unless you commit literal decades making crap money to eventually make decent.

What are some jobs that pay decent that have a good bit of mobility? Ideally, I don't want to go to school for 4 years and 60k in the hole.

All I know is I have very few barriers for my ideal job: Decent pay (currently make 32k/y not nearly enough), not getting absolutely yelled and shit on by people (aka not retail), and a more direct line of upward mobility (Akin to the trades, you do a,b,c you now get paid more. Not, put in that overtime and you MIGHT get a good review for that possible corporate raise)

I have no physical or mental disabilities, I just want to be financially independent.

Some jobs I've seen that entail what im looking for are: Plant operators, electricians, pipe fitters, drone pilots, tugboat hand, engineer

Bonus question: What do you personally believe is the "wave"? Or in other words, people went into the oil boom especially around the 70s, 80s made an entire career and life out of it. Same thing tech workers in the 90s early 00s that are now HIGH level workers with their choice of pay/location. What is going to be the next "wave" in your opinion?
