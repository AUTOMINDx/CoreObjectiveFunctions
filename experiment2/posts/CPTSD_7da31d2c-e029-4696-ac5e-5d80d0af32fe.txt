Has anyone else ever watched Steven Universe: The Future?
It’s the sequel for a cartoon show about a boy and the aliens and they save the world etc.  The sequel is dealing with the aftermath - healing from the trauma he has been through.  It’s actually pretty incredible.  Just wondering if anyone else has seen it and feel seen.
