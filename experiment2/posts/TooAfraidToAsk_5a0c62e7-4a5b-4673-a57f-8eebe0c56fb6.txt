Do guys actually care about your underwear?
This is something i see people talking about a lot and i don't know if is just a joke or a real issue. Will my partner be turned off if during our fun time he sees my pink Hello Kitty panties? I don't feel like i should always be ready for sex time, wearing the best lingerie from my wardrobe at all times, but does it really matter?
