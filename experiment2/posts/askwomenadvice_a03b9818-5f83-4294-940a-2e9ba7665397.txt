Should I gently call out what I think is a sexist comment from a good female friend?
Background: my friend, we'll call her M (F29), was in a relationship for ~2yrs with a guy, we'll call him A(M35), she loved him but for various reasons decided to break up with over a year ago now.

Context: M is now in a new thing. While A has recently started hooking up with a mutual friend, we'll call her B(F30). Imo, A&amp;B did the right thing, realising after they'd hooked up a couple of times that they want to keep doin it, and should let M know. (A&amp;B aren't dating, they're hanging out just as much as they did before only now they're intimate too).

Anyway, upon hearing the news M became quite upset.
Here's the problematic comment...

M says something along the lines of "Fucking hell B, getting around the community much, sleeping with x, y, z"

(Which for facts sake B had brief ~3-6mth relationships with x &amp; y, and never hooked up with z).

I have a couple problems with this statement, 1) is feels like B is getting the blame for the hurt M is feeling. 2) A loves to sleep around too and just as much "within the community" but that's a non-thing. 
To me, it just screamed blame the woman for a two party responsibility. This is coming from someone who proudly calls herself a feminist &amp; believes in sexual liberation for all genders.

To make things worse (in my eyes): since being told the news M had told B she's feeling hurt &amp; doesn't want to talk/see her. But M has actively sought out catching up with A.

I know M is hurting, but does that excuse this kind of comment? Should I gently tell her I found the comment laden with subconscious sexism?

Tldr: my friend said something I think is inherently a bit sexist &amp; I'm not sure if I should pull her up on it.
