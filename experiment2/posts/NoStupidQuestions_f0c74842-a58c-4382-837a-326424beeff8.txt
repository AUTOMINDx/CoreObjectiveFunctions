Is there a way to signal to a car behind you that they're driving at night without their headlights on?
I feel like I've frequently had drivers behind me lately driving without their headlights on after dark. It's likely making their drive harder, but it's also super dangerous for me and the other drivers around them. Is there a way to signal to them that they're being a moron and to turn their lights on? Can't use my high beams when I'm the one in front.
