Were IKEA instructions ever difficult? Is there something the stereotype of them being difficult is based on?
I have assembled dozens of IKEA products over the past 30-odd years. In all of them the instructions have been very clear. As long as you are capable of rotating a piece so that e.g. the 3 holes are on the left and the 2 holes are on the right instead of the other way round (as is clearly shown in the picture), or similar, they have all been straightforward. But for all that time I have heard comments about IKEA being difficult. Presumably this was due to experiences before IKEA improved their instructions. What did the instructions use to be like?
