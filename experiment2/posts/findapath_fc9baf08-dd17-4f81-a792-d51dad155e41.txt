Its right what i am doing?
Right now i am in a business administration college(MBA), starting my second year but i am trying to figure out how to make income before graduating, so i am taking an ux design course made by google because i found it intersting and i think its a well made course bc i want to work remotely. I am 17 years old btw, what would you recommend me to earn side income as a 17 year old? and it need to be remotely.
Sorry by my bad english i am not native from US.
