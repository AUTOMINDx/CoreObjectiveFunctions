How do I transition from a litigation attorney to a compliance officer?
Starting to come to the solid conclusion that I do not enjoy practicing law as a litigator. I started looking into compliance roles and I am curious to know if anyone has any guidance on how to further research this career transition or tips on how to obtain my first compliance job. TIA.
