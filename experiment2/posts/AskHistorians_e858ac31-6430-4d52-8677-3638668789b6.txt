What are historians thoughts on Mike Duncan's "Hero of Two Worlds"?
From what I understand he actually spent a couple years doing primary source research on Lafayette. So perhaps this book is better and more rigorous than his previous book The Storm Before the Storm, which AskHistorians seems to thing is misleading and no good. I searched but hadn't found any comments or review of the book on here. Thanks!
