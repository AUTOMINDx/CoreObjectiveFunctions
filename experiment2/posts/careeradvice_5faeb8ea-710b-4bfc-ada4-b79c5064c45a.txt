Patient Financial services DEP (HOSPITAL JOB ) How the process like? And the workload?
Has anyone worked in patient financial services? In a hospital ? if you did can you let me know how is the process of the interview is and how is the workload like? I will be graduating soon getting my BS in biology. I also wanted to do something in clinical experience ( not scribing as I already did this ) but everything else needs certification so that's the only job that I was able to get with the process of having an interview? And advice is appreciated?
