Women, how do you wipe from front to back when you pee?
I’m a woman. Honestly I’ve never known how women wipe from front to back in one movement. I’ve always just done the “two separate transactions” method if I poop, taking care of the back first and then the front - but I guess I’m still technically going “back to front” when I wipe even though I’m not actually wiping my ass. And if I pee, I wipe only my vulva and make sure I’m not going too far back with the TP. It has never been an issue for me. 

I assume people either start at the vulva and then push the TP back toward their ass? (Doesn’t it bunch up though?) But I’ve also seen people actually reach around and wipe their vulva from the back/side somehow, which does not seem at all physically possible.  

So how do you do it?
