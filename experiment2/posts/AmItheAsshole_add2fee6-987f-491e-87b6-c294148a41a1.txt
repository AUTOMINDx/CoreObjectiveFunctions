AITA for telling my mom she can’t come visit until after the holidays?
I live in the US and my mom lives overseas where I’m from. 
My wife and I just had our second baby a couple of months ago.
My mom kept saying how she wishes she COULD come since before he was born.
I talked to her a month ago and she said that she may have the miles but the exchange rate is brutal. So I assumed she’s not coming anytime soon. 
Then, five days ago she sends me a message and asks if she can come around December 15th. 
Now let me go back a bit. With my oldest, my mom came over because we were young and had a baby. She walked all over me and my wife as parents, crossed the line many times. I should have addressed it but I feel guilty being away from her and my dad and then call them out on their shit. Wrong on my part, and I admit it. 
So this baby being our last, my wife said she didn’t want my mom coming because she struggles to follow our rules and thinks she knows best regardless of what we think. If we knew from the get go that she was coming, we could have prepared mentally but with the little notice, she didn’t want my mom here and possibly ruining the last few days of her maternity leave. I actually agree with that because like I said, I suck setting boundaries with her because of guilt. My mom’s response once I told her to come in January, a 2 weeks delay, because we made plans for the holidays? “How dare you make plans that did not include your own mother?” 
Honestly, her reaction and arrogance thinking she is owed to spend our youngest first Christmas pissed me off. 
I do not think I’m the asshole. I’m setting a boundary and protecting my wife and my family and all I asked is for a 2 weeks delay.
