Rejected then invited for an exploratory interview??
I got a rejection letter the day before Thanksgiving after submitting an application a week before. Now three days later, I’ve been invited for an exploratory interview process for the same position. I have never done one of these and from google it says it’s an informal interview. Does this mean they’re reconsidering me as a candidate? I’ve never had someone reject me then double back so I have no clue if this is a good sign or if this was sent to me by mistake lol. I’m going to schedule it anyways, but I am wondering if I should get my hopes up. It’s a position I really want!!
