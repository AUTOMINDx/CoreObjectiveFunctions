I really need someone informed to talk to this about because I’m losing my mind in anxiety
This world is just so fucking scary it makes me so anxious. I used to be religious and now I believe more in spirituality but there is so much religious talk on tik tok especially and all this shit about human sacrifices for celebrities to get their fame and Illuminati and all that shit it scares me so much like why does the world feel like it’s just getting more evil. I wish there was evidence against all of this shit but I haven’t seen any I spent so many nights shaking with fear because I don’t know what’s real I get triggered by a single comment and then I spiral so deep
