Supplements While on PPI? Can the PPI help if only symptom is globus?
Hi all,

I’ve been prescribed PPI and I was wondering if there are any supplements I should take to minimize sides?

I’m also not sure if PPI is right as my symptoms are more like LPR, and don’t want to make it worse. I’ve started the low acid diet 100%.

More context to my story below:

I went to the ER today as the constant globus sensation past week has been killing me. Have been referred to GI and prescribed 2 months of Prantoprozole.

Honestly so scared it’s not going away. It’s had me thinking all sorts of awful thoughts and crying more than ever, which I know doesn’t help.

I’ve been burping after eating/drinking which I’ve never done before this started a week ago, and sometimes the globus feels like it is in my chest.

I had mild swallowing troubles intermittently the month leading up to this, and the morning it started I almost passed out I go so out of breath doing heavy incline leg press. I thought it may have been mirtazapine WD but really not sure, hernia perhaps?
