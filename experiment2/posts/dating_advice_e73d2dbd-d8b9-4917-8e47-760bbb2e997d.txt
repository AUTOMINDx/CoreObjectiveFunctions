It’s so high school, to me
Ghosting. Why do people think to do this?  We’re not in high school anymore. Talk to the person. The girl from my first ever date, did this to me. It’s been 3 or 4 years, and I’m still hurting. Don’t just think,”oh he/she’s a grown up, they won’t be hurt. Everyone has feelings.
