I lied
My T gave me the depression and anxiety scale forms to fill out again to compare from my intake and I improved some and she asked what it was due to and gave suggestions. I said yes to time and therapy, but I lied. Pretty sure the time thing is yes because I waited til I was at rock bottom from PTSD to get help and generally PTSD flashbacks etc will improve somewhat after a couple months anyway. 

But I felt I had to say yes to therapy helping because I didn’t want her to say that I had to go somewhere else if therapy isn’t working. I struggle a lot to open up and I know it’s frustrating, that she’s trying to figure out what will help me and trying to ask me what I need, except I have no idea. I don’t think it would be any better with anyone else - I trust no one. But I felt the need to just say that she was helping me, I guess maybe to not hurt her feelings and not get abandoned. 

Any advice besides just coming clean? Anyone else been in this situation and admitted that therapy wasn’t helping them?
