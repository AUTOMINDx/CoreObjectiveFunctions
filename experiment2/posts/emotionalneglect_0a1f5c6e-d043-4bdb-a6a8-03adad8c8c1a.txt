grieving for how lonely i was as a kid.
It's just really hitting me how lonely I was as a kid. The scenes are flooding back: me, ages 7-9, just sitting at the computer playing Neopets for hours every day. Me, ages 10-12, sitting in front of the television alone in the basement watching five hours straight of Disney Channel after school every day.  Me, ages 13-17, sitting alone doing homework for hours after school every day. Never any real, close friends. Never any emotional engagement from my parents. Just me, alone. All day, every day.

I don't remember crying about this. I imagine it felt like "just how life is". Like I didn't even realize how lonely and neglected I was. But looking back, I just feel so much grief. For how much I didn't even feel like a person. How much shame I felt. How much I didn't feel like I fit in at school. How I had no one to turn to. And so I lost touch with my emotional world myself, too. I became a shell of a human being, good only for achieving. 

And now I'm an adult, and I feel these same imprints of "lonely in a crowded room", "no one there for me", "doing life on my own", "separate from everyone else in the world" every single day. It honestly feels like it defines me. It's hard to even imagine who I am without this sense of "lonely, separate, unloved, ignored". But really seeing that younger self, numb and alone with no one to turn to and no real connection, I feel so much self-compassion. That feels like the only thing in my life that's real and true right now, and I'm thankful for that.
