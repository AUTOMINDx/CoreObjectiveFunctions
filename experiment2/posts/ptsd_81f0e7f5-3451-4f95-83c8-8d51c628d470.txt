Support Group
I haven’t been able to find a support group so I’ve decided to try to start my own. Our focus is women with PTSD or who have experienced SA/DV. Anyone who is struggling is welcome although we prefer to keep it woman focused due to the nature of the topics that will be discussed. If you’re looking for support please join us!
