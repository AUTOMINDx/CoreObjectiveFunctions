What did you do with your communication degree? Do you make a reasonable salary?
I just graduated with a BS in communication with a minor in marketing. I’ve been working a remote customer service job since last year, but I want to break into a different field. I have some ideas, but I’m not sure exactly what I want. Anyone have a similar major and minor combination and what field did you get into? Do you feel that you make a reasonable salary?
