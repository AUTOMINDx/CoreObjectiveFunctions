I found this free mental health app called Buddio
Free apps usually help me with managing my anxiety, especially those with CBT exercises similar to what your therapist would give you. One of my favorite apps is called Buddio. It has a lot of CBT-based exercises and makes them fun and easy to do. There is also a feed with several posts on tips and advice for managing my anxiety. It also uses gamification, which always leaves me feeling proud of myself when I polish a gem and gain points. Here is the link if anyone is interested in downloading it: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buddio/id1505262406](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buddio/id1505262406).
