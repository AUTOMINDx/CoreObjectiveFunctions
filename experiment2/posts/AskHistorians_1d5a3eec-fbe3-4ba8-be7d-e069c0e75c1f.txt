Yao Li the assassin
Hi,  
In Chapter 96 of Romance of the Three Kingdoms Jia Kui says to Cao Xiu, that he suspects Zhou Fang to be a traitor and a liar. That him cutting his own hair resembles the way Yao Li cut of his own arm to fool his target Qing Ling.  
I have the german translation of the book and in the footnote it is written (which usually gives some bit of historical background info), that apparently Yao Li (\~600BC) was a famous assassin, that killed his wife and cut off his own arm to fool and kill Qing Ling, the son of the prince of Lu. I'm very intrigued to learn the whole story.  
How did he fool Qing Ling with that strategy? The wikipedia entry doesn't say anything else other than him killing his mother too and the linked article doesn't exist anymore.  
Does anyone know the whole story or could give me a lead were I might find it?
