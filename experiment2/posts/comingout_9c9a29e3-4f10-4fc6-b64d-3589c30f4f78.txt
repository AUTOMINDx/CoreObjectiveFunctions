It feels like I’ll never come out…
I’m 17F and a lesbian. A few of my friends know, but I’m worried they don’t believe me (most of them are bi but I get the odd comment about if I could like men/sexuality is fluid stuff like that that isn’t said with bad intentions but is invalidating). I find it very hard to talk about, I can’t imagine ever being open about it. I worry everyday about telling my parents, I think sometimes that I could walk in to the kitchen and just say it, but it feels too life changing to ever say. I know they wouldn’t look at me the same ever again. I don’t think they’d even believe me- it feels like few people do. It makes me second guess myself even though I know I only like women. I’m very girly and had a few celeb ‘crushes’ on men to join in with my friends when I was younger, but have only had actual crushes/ fantasies about women. When I first realised it just made so much sense. I’m incredibly insecure and get nervous even when talking to my bi friends about women. In the back of my mind I always worry I’m being weird. I just wish I didn’t feel like this and that I could get it over with :(
