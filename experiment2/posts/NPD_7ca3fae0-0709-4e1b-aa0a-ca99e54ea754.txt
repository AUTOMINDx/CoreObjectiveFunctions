Christine Quinn on Selling Sunset: proof of how misunderstood Narcissism is.
I’m pretty sure a lot of those girls on that show are narcissistic in some way anyhow, but Christine Quinn, if we’re being honest, she’s your stereotypical high functioning narcissist. 
I felt so sorry for her during the entire show, and respected how much shit she took on for her past mistakes that were essentially results of some severe insecurities. The only other woman who was respectable in that show was the Mexican one, forget her name? 
Christine was bullied, mocked, bitched about for the entirety of the show. Like, there would be no show without her and they’re all giving her what she wants. I did have a peek on Twitter, and a lot of people are thinking in the same ways; she really is adored. 
The world is full of narcissists, but it’s also full of hypocritical assholes and those girls on that show were made to look so ugly towards the end. Christine is so much more pleasant all round.
