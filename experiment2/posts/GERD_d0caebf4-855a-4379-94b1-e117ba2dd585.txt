Palpitations/ fluttering after eating.
I am unsure if I have GERD but I believe I might as I suffer with the following:

- feelings of fullness/ trapped window 
- feelings of indigestion 
- heartburn/ reflux 
- having to swallow air and forced burp it out to relived symptoms 
- splash back of liquids when burping 
- making myself throw up to relive symptoms


I have been prescribed a handful of PPIs by my doctor but I am unsure how I should be using them as the instructions are slightly convoluted e.g. take 30 mins before food twice a day etc and I have anxiety around dosing these correctly. I also fear that the PPIs make my heart fluttering / indigestion worse. 

For the last few months I have noticed that my heart beats very hard and fast after eating  pretty much any food. This started out as certain trigger foods but has now escalated to everything I eat. This is also accompanied with a buzzing sensation in my legs and a sharp increase in anxiety. This is making my life extremely difficult and badly effecting my mental health. This set of symptoms can be some what relived by making myself throw up.

I have had a 24 hour ecg and am waiting on the results. My doctor doesn’t know what to do about it and I feel really abandoned and am frightened I have an underlying Heart condition that will be put me in an early grave.

My question is, does anyone have anything similar to the things I am experiencing? Or any insight into this? to be honest I am terrified.
