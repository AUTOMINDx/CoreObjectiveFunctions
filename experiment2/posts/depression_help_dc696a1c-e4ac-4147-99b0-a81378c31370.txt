This is not a light issue
I’m a man in my early 20’s who has been suffering in silence since I was first able to form memories. My mother did everything she could on her own to give me a great childhood and it would absolutely destroy her to hear the trauma I underwent as a young child. (ages 4 1/2-7ish. It’s hard to remember how long it lasted because I’ve repressed it so deeply.) If my story got out it would surely tear my family to shreds and that’s not even including the details of my experiences. As I’ve reached high school/college age, I have become more than just sexually active; I am fully addicted to sex and lust festers in my mind. I can’t even escape it in my dreams. Not only does it affect my relationships with women but more importantly my relationship with Jesus as a Christian man. This past year has been the hardest because the repressed memories are becoming more prevalent in my thoughts and I don’t know how to escape the mental prison I’m in. Ive tried to run from my problems by leaving everything behind and joining the army directly out of high school and I am more than blessed to have been discharged honorably regarding my prior hard drug addiction. The drugs/alcohol I can do without and have been for a while, but I still do like to party every now and it does not negatively effect me since I’m just in college and only do it for recreation. The only thing I cannot escape is the lust and PTSD from my younger days. It just hurts every single day to have this on my mind when all of my friends and family look up to me as a strong man and leader and are under the allusion that I’ve had a kush life growing up. Most of them undermine me because they think I have not experienced real trauma. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this life.
