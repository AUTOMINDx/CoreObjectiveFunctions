I have poor communication skills
It’s like if I get into a fight with anyone (which happens rarely online) I immediately get a mini anxiety attack and I feel like disappearing from their existence forever because I’m my mind, to me, there’s just no way I can be forgiven and so the best thing to do is just to fuck off for good.
