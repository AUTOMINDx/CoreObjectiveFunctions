Is it as bad as they say to accept a counter-offer?
Two other people at my company that started at the same time as me just got promoted and one of them told me how much they're making now, which is $30k more. Apparently, they had applied to other companies in the industry and got offers, our manager then made matching counteroffers, which they accepted. I applied to other companies and now have three offers which would have the title and pay bump and even a sign on bonus for two of them. I don't necessarily dislike my current company and would like to stay since I have acclimated myself now and also my project team would be even more short-staffed... A lot of what I read on Reddit is that counteroffers generally should not be accepted. I'm just not sure what I should do.
