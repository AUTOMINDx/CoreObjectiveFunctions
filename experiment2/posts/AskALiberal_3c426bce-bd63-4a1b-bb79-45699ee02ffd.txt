How is the Africa ban different from the Middle East ban
Both are dark skinned and probably muslim countries and areas. Both sets of restrictions limited immigration for the national interest (covid and crime). Trump's ban is considered racist, I haven't heard the Dems complain about the Africa ban. Can you guys explain the difference as you see it?
