My world revolves around my girlfriend and it scares me
I’m a 23 year old guy, she’s a 21 year old girl.
We’ve been together since more than a year now and things couldn’t be better between us. Everytime we see each other it’s magic, we go on romantic dates, we have great sex, i like her friends and she likes mine, i like her family and she likes mine as well. I’m in love with her and i tell her that quite often, she’s in love with me and she tells me that quite often as well. 
The ONLY problem in my opinion, is that we don’t get to see each other often enough. I live and work in Paris, she is from Saint Brieuc and studies in Angers (all french cities). My problem is that i constantly think of her whenever we’re separated, i make plans to make sure i’ll be able to go see her as soon as possible. It causes me to stress a lot. One time she was supposed to come and see me in Paris but couldn’t in the end because the train tickets were too expensive or the trains were all full. At that moment everything i could think of was « if she had taken her tickets early enough as i advised her then i wouldn’t be feeling miserable right now because she’s not coming »
That thought scared me. She was able to handle the distance and separation for one more week way more easily than i did and it scares me. It scares me that i’m not able to be cool about it. What can i do to fix that ?
