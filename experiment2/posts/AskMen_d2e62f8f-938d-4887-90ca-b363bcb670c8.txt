Men of Reddit, how do you deal with body image issues and what issues do you wish were spoken about more?
There has been this wave of “body positivity” and normalizing what society might deem flaws but is clearly more focused on women. After having a good discussion with a friend of mine about how men feel they cannot be vocal in the same way about their bodies and celebrating them, I wanted to ask your opinions to educate myself more. 

Whatever you’re comfortable with sharing. Thank you in advance :)
