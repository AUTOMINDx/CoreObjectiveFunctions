Where: Feminist Spaces in the Philippines
Does anyone know a filipina feminist space? Discord, books, literary texts anything that is related to it. I am a 17yrs old filipina who feels like the feminism I have learned is mostly west focused. I feel so lost. Even though the west feminism is a great start for me I want to focus in my country. Any suggestions will do!
