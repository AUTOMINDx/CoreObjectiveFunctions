What do I do when I'm being blackmailed to date someone?
Basically I got into a fight with one of my friends and we broke things off. Recently they came to me and threatened to tell people i care about negative and personally things about me if I wasn't the perfect boyfriend and doing things. What do I do in this situation? If she tells anyone things will crash and burn around me. I'm not a bad person and im not scared of my image im scared of people knowing so much about me. 

If I do anything I'm in trouble what do I do??
