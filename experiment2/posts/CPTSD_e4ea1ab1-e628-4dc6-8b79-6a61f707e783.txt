Vacuuming makes me cry. I just did it successfully.
I have full on panic attacks when I vacuum without headphones. The loud noise of the vacuum scares me SO bad. I have to have music blasting or else I can’t do it. 

Well, I can’t find my headphones anywhere and I just vacuumed part of my carpet. It wasn’t for very long, about 2 minutes, but that’s a huge achievement for me. 

I’m so proud of myself
