I got beaten just because i said i wanted to killed myself
This was 3 years ago im 15 now. I remember i was so stressed and sick of my parents I remember saying I'll kill myself. I couldn't remember this well but i remember my father attacked me for saying that. They're so fucked up in the head. My mother encouraged this to happen. I remember one of them said 'go ahead and kill yourself and I'll just cry when you dead and forget about it' . They think. I wanted to do this because i wanted to have my own way. My father said I'll go in hell if i committed suicide.
