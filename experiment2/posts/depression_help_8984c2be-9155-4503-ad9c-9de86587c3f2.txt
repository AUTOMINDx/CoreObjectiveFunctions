doing drugs to feel happy
i’m 18 about to be 19 and have never tried to get professional help for my depression because i don’t know how to ask for it and i don’t want my friends finding out and treating me differently. so instead of getting help i’ve turned to drugs like weed and opioids such as codeine and oxy to feel happy for a few hours. how do i quit this and get proper help when i’m to scared to ask for it ??
