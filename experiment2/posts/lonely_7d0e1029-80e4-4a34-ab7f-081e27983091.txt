Whats the point of being yourself if nobody likes the real you? I'm stuck in a cycle and I don't know what to do
Everyone tells me to 'be yourself'. school, home, literally anywhere. And I've tried to, I really did, but nobody likes me when I am. Everyone that is stuck in my day to day life think I'm weird and a loser. People always say 'the right person will come some day' but when? When will they come? Nobody likes me, nobody even acknowledges me unless they feel pity for me. 

I've tried to hide myself in a mask too, be someone more likable. But I feel so uncomfortable hiding myself, I don't even have fun like what friends should have. I want to have friends desperately but I also want to have fun too.

I'm just stuck in a cycle. I be myself nobody likes me, but when I'm not I feel uncomfortable. What do I do?
