Seem to be rejected from every job
I have been trying to get a job for five years. I have changed my career path in the last two years I have degrees one in English and the other in film.
Despite having lots of qualifications I can’t seem to get even the most basic of jobs not even elderly care home job.  
So I have a applied to all kinds of jobs not just my dream jobs but also any jobs I feel I am capable of.
I don’t understand it I have changed my CV so many times I’ve written cover letters to the best of my ability I’ve created a portfolio to show off my best to work and still nobody seems to want to hire me I don’t get it.
The rejections are often without reason.  It has gotten to a point where I don’t even want to try and apply anymore because I already know what’s going to happen.

I’m 25 and if I don’t get a job soon I will probably be homeless one day.
It’s hard for me to not get angry and upset since no one cares but I also realize that this is the real world and it is not personal.

I would appreciate it if someone on here could give me some advice as to what I’m doing wrong
