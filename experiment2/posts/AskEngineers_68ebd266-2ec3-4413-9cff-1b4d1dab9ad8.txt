What skills/competencies do I need to pursue a career as a product design engineer?
For reference, I graduated 1 year ago (BSME), been working at a small MEP firm for just over 7 months. I've been managing my own (relatively small) projects for a while now (mostly small commercial buildings, but some multi-family and light industrial facilities as well).

I'll be moving cross-country for family reasons this spring (maybe sooner if the job search goes well) and figured it would be a good opportunity to change industries, as I'm pretty dissatisfied with my current job. I've always found product design appealing, and would like to eventually end up there. I'd like get a list going of relevant skills/competencies that I need so I can specifically call out what I can on my resume, and maybe take some steps to address my deficits.
