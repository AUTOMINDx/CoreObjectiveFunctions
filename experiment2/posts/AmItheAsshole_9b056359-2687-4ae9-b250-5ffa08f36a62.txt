AITA for asking my bf to vape for a weekend?
My bf (24m) and I (24f) were invited by my parents to come on a weekend retreat with my family. My boyfriend smokes weed all day every day, it's the first thing he does when he gets up and the last thing before he goes to sleep. I smoke daily as well, but usually only at the end of the day. Sidenote: smoking weed is legal where I live. 

My parents and I are not particularly close and I don't feel comfortable smoking around them. They have expressed that they don't want to know what I am up to when it comes to booze/drugs. Nobody in my family smokes at all, not even cigarettes. My family is not big on drinking, either.

I don't feel comfortable bringing weed to this getaway. I asked my bf if he would consider vaping instead of smoking, since it is more discreet. I have a vape that he could use. He flat-out said no, wouldn't even consider it. I told him the idea of him bringing weed and smoking in front of my parents makes me very uncomfortable. He said that being around my family makes him uncomfortable and he should therefore be able to smoke.

I don't think I'm being unreasonable. We'll be there for two/three days at  most. I'm not even asking him to not smoke at all, an option I would prefer but I know he would reject immediately. I'm just asking him to consume his weed in a more discreet way. AITA?
