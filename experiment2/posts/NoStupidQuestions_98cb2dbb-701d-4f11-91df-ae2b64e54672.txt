Do doctors still find the human body attractive after having to work on them with medical problems 100+ hours a day?
I've always been curious about if doctors find the human body attractive or disgusting after having to work on people all day long with so many different fluids, smells, and diagnoses. 

Especially if they are attracted to the female body type for obgyn or if attracted to the male body with the physicals. 

Maybe it's actually a turn-on? I'm just curious. 

Thanks
