How do I handle a full time job, home life and a relationship?
Been on  work for 2 years due to anxiety and depression and a potential eating disorder. 

Been back to work since 27th September this year and it's still very overwhelming for me but I am coping...with work. When it comes to home and relationship life I feel like I can't manage both, either one or the other and I just want to be able to handle all but how?
