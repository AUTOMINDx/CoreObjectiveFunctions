I feel so behind in life and like I don’t really know how to do anything
I have so much stuff I want to do with my life but every time I try to I just get reminded of how much I don’t know and how “behind” I feel. Like I know I can always learn, but it’s like I’m only 20 but I’m already 20 and I just feel so behind and lost all the time. It’s just kind of discouraging knowing that there’s so much I don’t know that I probably should by now and it just feels sort of humiliating and I always feel kind of ashamed about it. I feel like my parents just didn’t teach me certain things and now that I’m an adult the responsibility is mine to teach myself. I don’t know if I can completely blame my parents though, because I’m pretty sure there’s lots of stuff they don’t know because their parents didn’t teach them. Like I said, I can always learn but I carry a lot of shame and embarrassment from this because it feels sort of humiliating to not know things that other people my age all learned from their parents when they were young. It makes doing things like going to college, getting an apartment, etc. a little more difficult. And this mixed with my overthinking always sends me into a “hopelessness” spiral and I end up doing nothing. Does anyone else feel this to any extent?
