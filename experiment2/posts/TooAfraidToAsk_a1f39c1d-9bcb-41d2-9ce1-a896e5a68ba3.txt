How would you feel if you received a thank you card 11 months after a situation?
Probably a silly question for this sub, but I’m genuinely too embarrassed to ask elsewhere. In January of this year I was hospitalized from anaphylactic shock, and put in a coma for a few days. When I came home I learned that besides my immediate family, basically all my extended relatives and my parents’ friends had called about me and some, being in the healthcare field, regularly checked in and helped my parents understand what was happening to me in the hospital (I had to be alone because of covid restrictions). 

Anyway, I made some thank you cards not too long after I came out (basically just thanking them for their prayers and well wishes and for being there for my family while I was in the hospital), and I’ve given them to my immediate family but not all of my extended relatives/friends. I’m genuinely so embarrassed to even send them at this point, because it’s been almost a year now since it happened 😭 Time flew and I don’t even have a good excuse for not sending them either, other than dealing with literal debilitating depression,  having had a hard time picking up my writing skills again (my hand would shake so bad writing anything; ironically I’m a calligrapher too so what a convenient skill to lose 😁), school, and just flat out procrastination. 
 
What would your reaction be if you received a card from me 11 months later thanking you for all the well wishes ?? I feel like it would literally be so random and you probably wouldn’t even remember what I’m talking about 😭 Should I include something in the card itself, like apologizing for sending it so late? But no one is expecting a card anyway so what would I even be apologizing for ? 😭  A part of me would love to just forget about the cards I haven’t sent, but honestly I truly am thankful for my relatives and I think it would eat me up (more than it currently is) if I never told them I appreciated them thinking of me and my family when I was sick.

Ahh I’m genuinely so embarrassed even just writing this post is killing me and I absolutely hate that I put these cards off for so long but would appreciate some perspective! Thank you all. 😊

TLDR: I suck and didn’t thank my family for their well wishes immediately after I was hospitalized in January. Would it be too random/embarrassing/cringe to send out the thank you cards I had planned on sending now, 11 months later?
