So I went on a first date..
We met at a bar, then hopped around to a few others as they closed. We had a great time chatting and one place even had a cover band. 

We met through tinder, so I knew cat fishing (or at least tightly controlling how you’re seen) was a thing. This girl has a pretty face, but is bigger than I pictured. 

I myself used to be really fat, and I want to say I have nothing against bigger people. Especially when things click, and we have a good time together. 

For some reason it almost feels like a deal breaker. But I know it’s me being judgmental. 

It may come from one time in college, I brought a girl to have dinner with my parents, and my dad cracked a fat joke when she was gone. Now I almost feel embarrassed for whatever reason. 

I want it to not be a problem. I could tell she was into me and she seems cool (has a career started, living in her own, has a dog) when I don’t necessarily have the independence she does. I digress. 

I’m wondering if anyone else here has similar experiences.
