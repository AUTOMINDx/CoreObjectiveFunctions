Hey! I don’t know if this is the correct sub to post this on but I need some help!
So I (15M) have a really tough time socializing.. I’ve been dealing with depression, social anxiety, and a bit of bipolar-ness for the last two ish years and I’ve always found it hard to conversate with people but recently I went to a party and had a good time socializing (let’s just say I was on something) but I found it fun socializing and the next day I carried on and went on the school bus and sat down to this dude I know (not well) and tried to enter a conversation with him but as soon as a spoke the first word my whole entire body froze up and I stuttered and I felt uneasy and heavy chested like I was holding in a giant gasp of air that I didn’t wanna let it out so I ended up freezing up and jus shaking my head to everything he was asking me and the last word I said to him was “I got to go” and sat down on a seat and let out a big gasp of air into my hoodie sleeve.. that was around 3 weeks ago now I’ve learned that I contradict myself a lot and I care what others think of me and I have a weird humour.. and I still find it it hard to talk to people .. so I guess what I’m asking for is any tips ? On how to socialize better and get that uneasy feeling gone and ask questions and be out going and happy and positive ?
