Why do therapists dislike medication?
Like when I started therapy they were all like “medication is a last resort, we want you to build up your coping skills and resiliency first” and some other CBT stuff. But like, yeah, I’m sure that will help once I build it, but would it not hurt for me to be on something that makes it so I don’t have massive anxiety attacks in the meantime?
