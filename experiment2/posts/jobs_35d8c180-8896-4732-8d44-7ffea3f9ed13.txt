My newish boss told me to revamp some goals last minute and I kind of feel weird about it. Am I overthinking?
So I've been at this large company for less than a year and because my department is still growing I ended up getting a new boss as my previous boss already had a lot on his plate.

With the first boss, it was known that everyone employee sets goals for themselves (obviously used for promotion justification) and after some few discussions, I was able to create a list of goals and they were all approved by the first boss.

Second boss is assigned about a month later and we of course had a transition meeting and I also sent him my goal sheet, to which he stated in email he reviewed. He's overall super nice and polite and up front if he has a strong opinion about something.

Cut to now, all of a sudden my goals need to be revised as they were too vague and not 'good.' He wasn't mean or anything, I just found it odd that he suddenly rereads it now and makes revising  suggestions. Idk, something about our last discussion seemed odd to me. When I created my goals initially, I followed as closely as possible to incorporate company thought principles as well as relevant metrics.
