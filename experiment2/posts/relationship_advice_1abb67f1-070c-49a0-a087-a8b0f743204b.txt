How do you move on after realizing you were the toxic one the whole time?
I broke up with my ex about 5 months ago now. I believed she was the toxic one. I’ve had time to think though. I’ve realized I was the toxic one. I treated her terribly and she loved me so much. 

I treated her like I didn’t give a fuck about her. I told her to get out of my life during our arguments. I said horrible things. 

I still think about her a lot and I feel terribly every day for the pain I’ve caused her. I went completely NC to help her heal from me. I just want her to be happy. Being with me was a great deal of pain and misery for her. 

I’m at the point now where my pain of how I treated her is unbearable. 

How do I try to forgive myself for this? Has anyone else felt similar?

S, if you’re reading this, I just want you to know how sorry I am. And you will be happy.
