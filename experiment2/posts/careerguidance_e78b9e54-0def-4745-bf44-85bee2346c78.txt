24 yr old w/ bachelors but no job or prospects. Any advice?
I am a 24 year old with a bachelors in economics. I am also in the Air Force Reserves. However, I currently don't have a job after graduating and I never had any internships thanks to COVID. I wish someone told me sooner or I realized that business/finance is not what I want to do and the lifestyle does not appeal to me. I have always been a tech centric person and wish I went for computer science instead. With that in mind, I have been self teaching myself some basic html, css, and javascript and would like to transition into a developer/ engineer role but the more I research, I realize that this is going to take longer than I expected.  What im really asking is what do you think my next move should be? Should I go back to school for CS? I would go back but the fact that it is 2 more years and no or little income makes me feel selfish and like a failure. Do I attend a bootcamp? There are so many options which makes it stressful to decide which one to go to and there's no guarantee that I will land a job afterwards. Should I find a job somewhat related to my degree and just take more time to self-teach and become proficient in coding then transition? I have been applying to jobs related to my degree just so I can get some income and feel less bad for myself but I have gotten no  interviews or offers.  I have considered the thought of doing the Data Analytics certification through Google to accompany my Econ degree and try to become a data analysis. That career field from what I gathered involves some coding which I could then use to transition to a software engineering position. I know this is a lot but should I try and find something in the meantime, go back to school or attending a bootcamp, or any other suggestions?
