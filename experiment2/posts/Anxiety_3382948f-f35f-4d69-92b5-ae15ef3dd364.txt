What the hell is wrong with me
I am in a LDR and my girlfriend came to visit  and I was so so so excited, and so was she! It was all good up until the drive to the airport. I felt incredibly sick very very quickly. To make a long story short I couldnt eat, was throwing up, and had to take Ativan which made me feel completely out of it. I just dont know what is wrong with me. I have dealt with horrible anxiety before but seriously WTF?! I just feel so guilty because I really was so excited and I feel like I completely fucked up. My girlfriend and I were still able to do things but it definitely limited things. I have explained myself and apologized so many times, and she understands. I have been very open about my mental health and my girlfriend is an absolute angel and has always been there for me. But there is still this part of me that feels so guilty. Why did I do that? Why cant I enjoy anything? Like everything has been ruined because of me and now this. I just cant see a bright side.
