What is something in history that was meant to be temporary, but became permanent only because no one ever changed it?
It could be an important building or structure, or perhaps an important law, program or institution.  Something that was fully intended to be for temporary use only when it was built or established, but ended up becoming permanent simply because nobody ever bothered to change, end, or replace it.
