Anxiety impacting physical health
I (23M) got diagnosed with high blood pressure and the doctor said probable cause is stress and anxiety.

I can't help feeling anxious. Just when things seem to be improving and going good in my life, something from my past comes and hits me hard and it feels I am entering the same hell I struggled for so long to exit.

Every minor setback just reinforces the urge for me to just disappear.

I have no idea what to do now that it's also impacting my blood pressure and physical health.

Please help.
