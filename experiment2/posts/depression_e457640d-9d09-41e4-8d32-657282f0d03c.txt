I miss an old friend who was everything to me...
Ok, so she was my classmate back in my school.. Now I'm in second year uni ...She wasn't a gf or something but she was like a sibling to me.. She's the best person I've ever met...2019-20 were the happiest days ever in my life.. Now we barely talk with each other... We didn't have any big fight or something... She's just moved on and found new friends.. Also she got married recently... But I couldn't digest the fact that she's gone from my life.. We still follow each other on insta but something's stopping me from texting her (NOT EGO).. She's busy with her life rn cuz she's doing a professional course.. Even I'm busy with my life but still I'm reminiscing about all the old memories...  I have my exams coming week.. So I'm thinking of texting her after my exams.. Should I do so or I just move on?? (Apologising for my bad english )
