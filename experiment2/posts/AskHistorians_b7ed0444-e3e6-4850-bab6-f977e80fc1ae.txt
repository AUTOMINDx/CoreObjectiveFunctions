Musically speaking, what is the meaning of a "carol?"
With Christmas approaching, we talk about Christmas carols, and during Eastertide my church hymnal has some Easter carols listed. Is a "carol" a specific type of music (using particular rhythm or melody), or is it a term that's been applied more broadly to songs that are sung during a holiday?
