AITA for telling my husband to buy our son the Christmas gifts he missed out on last year.
So last year my son wasn't really the best kid. He was still a sweetheart but had gotten in trouble because he didn't finish a lot of his online schoolwork and instead played Minecraft and Fortnite. After we grounded him for a month and didn't let him play his games for a while he learned his lesson and got better grades. Last Christmas we were going to buy him a Ps4 and surprise him but since he didn't get better until after Christmas. This year however he got a lot better and after thanksgiving dinner, I asked him what he wanted he told me he wanted whatever he missed out on last year because he didn't want us to waste money on new presents and wanted a fresh start. I thought this was sweet but my husband, however, thought this was funny. He laughed at my son and said you missed out last year you'll have to try harder to get that. Now I'll admit that my son hasn't been perfect and even got grounded a few times but he was better this year and his grades only slipped once. I talked with my husband and told my husband that our son deserved his Christmas presents this year and needs this to boost his morale and do better in the future. My husband believes that our son needs to learn that he can't make up for every mistake and needs to simply understand that life doesn't give back everything he loses. So Am I the Asshole or not.
