I just got two job offers. is it worth finishing my second bachelor's degree? I'm already 40k in student loan debt.
I struggled to get a job when I graduated in 2020 with a BA in Psych. I decided to get a business degree from WGU, transferred in a lot of credits, and could potentially graduate by next summer with a second BS degree. 

Well, I recently got two job offers, one in hr payroll and one as a student support person for a community college. They both pay fairly well and would look good on a resume. I am wondering if it's worth finishing the second degree. I am already 40k in debt, I don't know if I should go and get a second degree, even if I'd only be adding another 4k in debt for the next semester.

I only signed up for WGU because I couldn't get a job with my BA and was scared as hell. Now, I have some job offers. I wonder if it's worth getting the second degree. If I extend my education, I am thinking of learning to code or some data analytics. Community college tuition is free for me, so I might as well learn a trade or learn to code. 

What would you do in my situation?
