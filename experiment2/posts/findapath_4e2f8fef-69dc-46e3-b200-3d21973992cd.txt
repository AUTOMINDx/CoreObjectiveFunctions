Want to find a job unrelated to my degree (physiotherapy)? - Sydney
Sorry for the long rant! Physio graduate with some experience in a bit of everything, wanting a career change. Hoping individuals in the business space can give me ideas on some roles that I am possibly qualified to do. 

Context - 

I am a physiotherapy new grad and want to change career paths instead of becoming a physiotherapist.

Whilst studying, I was doing a generalist role for a company (HR, project management, sales, marketing, accounting, management and training other staff, writing applications for awards and bursaries (and being selected). 

The business is in the disability/ engineering sector and has different branches. 

I really like the above aspects of the role and despite not being trained, I taught myself everything but I don’t know what jobs would accept me as my only qualification is physiotherapy. 

My previous jobs were all typical admin jobs in healthcare settings. 

I am also afraid of listing my current employer as a reference in case it makes things awkward. 

I would’ve stuck with the above job if I was given actual lunch breaks and annual leave (forced to work all the time and too many varied roles no career progression). 

I really want to find a fulfilling, challenging role where I can grow. I know I have the potential to achieve great things and am incredibly hard working, innovative and self-driven.


Thank you!
