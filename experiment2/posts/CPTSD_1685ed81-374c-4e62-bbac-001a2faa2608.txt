I opened up to my cpstd to my manager and set boundaries
I consider my manager like kind of a work friend. Sometimes he’s really cool and I know he appreciates me as an employee. But his main way of speaking to me had become just negging me. I like a little negging and some banter every now and then. Sprinkle some in, but it became very one note. Him being fake mean kind of just became *mean* mean. Always saying he hated me, teasing me, shoving me. Mind you, he’s a man and I’m a fairly small woman.

I know he’s going through some stuff, but I feel like he makes it everybody’s problem sometimes. I texted him last night and divulged in telling him that I struggle with cptsd and bipolar and he was triggering me. I told him that I was reaching my breaking point and my fear of confrontation wouldn’t let me tell him in person.

He thanked me for telling him and apologized for the way he’s been acting. I’m hoping things can be normal but I’m scared I overreacted.
