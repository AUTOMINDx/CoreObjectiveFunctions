If it could just stop, that'd be great...
Has anyone else had anxiety just pop up out of nowhere?

I've had panic attacks before in the past, but they never bothered me. I never fixated on them. I just went about my business the next day. Also I had zero anxiety symptoms. No dpdr, no shakiness, no increased heart rate, just no anxiety minus the 3 times I had panic attacks.

But about 4 months ago, I'm suddenly having tons of anxiety symptoms, getting panic attacks that leave me shaken for days, anticipating my next panic attack, and just living in a heightened sense of fear and uneasiness.

Granted these symptoms showed up when I had a major life changing event. But I've had major life changes before and never had anxiety...So I'm wondering what's so different now?

Can anyone else relate to this? And if you have had anxiety from a major life changing event, were you eventually able to go back to the way you were before anxiety?

I miss my old self....
