Is tired eyes and a heavy feeling in the forehead a known symptom of DPDR?
I don't want to attribute everything to DPDR since there are a thousand other possible causes, but I have noticed that on my bad days, my eyes tend to feel heavy and my field of vision becomes narrower and I get a dense feeling behind my eyes in my forehead areas - whereas on my good days like to day, I can keep my eyes open effortlessly and my field of vision is wider.

So has anyone else experienced this?
