New job first day help and advice - nervous, anxious and social anxiety.
I deal with depression, stress, anxiety and social anxiety on daily basis. I will be starting a new job in the office soon after leaving a super comfortable job of 14 years.

I need some help and advice on how to become less nervous, anxious and how to meet everyone at work and in the department with social anxiety on my first day at work?

Also, I have been invited to a welcome lunch on my first day at work at a restaurant with the colleagues. So with social anxiety, how can I become more comfortable at the welcome lunch? Please help and advice.

Thank you very much.
