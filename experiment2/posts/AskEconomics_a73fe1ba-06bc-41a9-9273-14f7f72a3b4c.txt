Would this work? What if the money supply were solely increased by essentially allowing producers of certain items (food, handmade items) to print money, the amount based upon how many products they sold. This method of increasing the money supply would lead to lower prices on the designated goods.
So the government tells farmers and solo artisans, hey you sell 10 items, we’ll print you a dollar. 20 items, two dollars. So, this would lead those people to charge less for their products, since they’re making printed money as well. Prices drop. Everyone’s happy. No more sweatshops. Everyone just buys locally made clothes. Fresh food grown in urban farms. The amount of jobs would increase since all you have to do is learn how to sew and you can start your own business. Yay.
