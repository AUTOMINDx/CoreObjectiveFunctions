[TX] Choosing a masters program for an HR professional.
I currently hold a BSc.HRM, and I am considering to do an MSc but I'm not sure which to selected to enhance my career. The options are MSc HRM and MSC Organizational Development.  I am not sure which one to choose. OD is an area I like but would getting an HR masters cover the OD areas? I hope someone has experience with this to guide me to.choosing the best option .
