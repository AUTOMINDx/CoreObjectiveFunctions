How to be social?
Hey guys hope u all had a nice day
So i wanna talk about my situation rn and get ur opinions about it, so i always wanted to be so social and communicate well with anyone like even with an stranger in our ages that i see in a park,but the thing is 1_idk how to do it and how to find cool friends 
2_i think im a little lazy and i cba to hang out with my friends
Id have that many friends but well im trying to find new friends and be social but im not seccusful at it , like im trying to be more energetic and be funny and cool (im not a serious person anyway and im more funny than my friends and ppl arround me usually) but i still dont have that many friends and i just dk how to find new ones
I've just looked for solutions in google or utube and they were like get out of ur comfort zone and like try to shake hands with ppls randomly to warm urself up and things like this but dont u all think doing these methods r so weird? Like imagine walking in a Crossway and shake hands to person that is passing next to u
So in short i just rly rly wanna make new friends but idk how 
Also id like the friends i have that much so thats why im lazy to hang out with them maybe idk
Im sure so many ppls in our age has the same problems so ur helps can fix this for so many ppls guys (im 18 btw)
Sorry for my bad english and Grammer mistakes english is not my first language 
Thanks for ur helps
