Should i negotiate my salary
Hello!

I'm graduating this December and just got an offer, this job is the only offer I have had and one of the two places I got an interview with so I have very little leverage. It's a non-profit offering me $56,000, and I'll be graduating with a social sciences degree, I have some work experience with co-ops and summer internships but unsure if this is worth a little negotiation (most people keep telling me to always negotiate but I wasn't expecting a salary more than 40-50K)
