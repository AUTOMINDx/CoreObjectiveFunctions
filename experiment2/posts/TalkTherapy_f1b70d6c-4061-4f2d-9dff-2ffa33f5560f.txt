Invested
Has your therapist ever told you they are invested in your recovery/healing? I am pretty avoidant and untrusting and I think my therapist said it to connect and I can’t decide if I trust that they meant it. I guess it did the job, I’ve been thinking about it all day - whether she is invested or not. But I can’t decide if it makes me want to run away or if it makes me trust her or why.
