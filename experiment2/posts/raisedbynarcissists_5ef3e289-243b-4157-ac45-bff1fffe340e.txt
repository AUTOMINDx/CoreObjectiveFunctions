Gaslighting/ Emotional Invalidation
Hi all,

I was just wondering if any of you have tried explaining how you feel to your NPD parents and what kind of responses you receive.

I tried explaining tonight that I often feel invalidated when I try to express myself, and the response was: "you're the only one who feels that way about me.  I talk to hundreds of ppl each day and no one says this kind of thing about me."

I told him he's literally invalidating me again as we speak.

Or I told him as a daughter it's hard for me to trust him because he has lied to me so often throughout my life, and his response was: "I don't lie.  I'm a good and sincere person."

He's essentially saying everything I am saying is wrong again right?  

Does it come across as me picking on him by saying this?  Do you all have similar experiences?

What is the right way to respond at this point?

I appreciate you for reading/ sharing experiences.
