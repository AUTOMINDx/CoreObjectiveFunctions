I'm a horrible person
I don't deserve to have friends, I'm horrible to them. They do so much better than me at school, might as well kms. I'm just another person that doesn't matter at all, I'm not special or different. I literally don't have a single talent or anything unique about me. I'll just stop existing so that the people worth something can succeed without me dragging them down.
