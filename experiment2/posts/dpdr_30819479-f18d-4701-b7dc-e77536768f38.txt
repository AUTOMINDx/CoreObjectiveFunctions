Looking in the mirror and seeing someone that’s not “me”
I’ve had a hard time pretty much always looking at pictures of myself when I was little. The more I go to therapy and talk about my childhood I realize that (maybe my entire existence) I’ve been completely depersonalized from everything when it comes to looking at myself. It gets pretty bad sometimes when I look in the mirror and realize I have no fucking idea who I am? Like physical features.. I begin these thought loops of “who the fuck is this” “what do people see?” “Am I actually seeing myself?” Leading to more of this intense Alice in wonderland effect with my vision and perception. I know that it’s dpdr and try to rationalize with myself what’s going on but there are just these times of having absolutely no recognition of my face or body. It’s almost this clarity that hits me of realizing “wow who is that little girl in those pictures? And she’s standing in a mirror rn?” Does this resonate with anyone
