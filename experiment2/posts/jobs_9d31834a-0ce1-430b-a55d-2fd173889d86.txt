Can we talk about nepotism in the trades?â€¦
I have some questions to any who might be able to shed light on this. We have a shortage of high skilled labour. So why is it so hard to get in the trades unless you know someone? Why are all the day labourer p.o.c. While all well payed positions are dominated by w.a.s.p. This seems to be a common trend in Ontario, Canada. Is this trend common elsewhere? To those  currently working at  or over 100k/year as a tradesman, how did you get started, and what year?
