Anyone else have a job under their level of competence in order to focus on recovery?
Last year I started ACA at about the same time I graduated with my masters. Although I did look for a job in my field, I ended up getting a job that someone with a high school diploma can get, and it is hard work for low pay. I did this because my mental and physical health is more important than anything and I wanted to put more of my focus on that. I’ve been doing the job for a year now but it’s getting to the point that I have to start looking for a better job ( looking at you student loans). Anyone else go through this?
