Am I taking To Long to Get my Degree?
Hello all. A little background, started at a community college right after highschool (Fall 2016), worked while going to school with the intent to get a BSME. Transferred to a local University after 2.5 years (Spring 2019), have been working, taking classes in the Fall, Spring and Summers since then. As of this moment, I am taking 2 courses, first semester Capstone and a required ME class. And next semester I am currently enrolled to do the capstone and one tech elective. After this semester I will only have 6 credits left. My grades are fine (3.94 gpa) but geez, I'm absolutely exhausted. I feel like I have nothing to show for the past 5 years. On top of that, I don't even know if I can mentally continue the capstone. My group members don't care and don't work, my advisor doesn't care and keeps changing his mind on what we should be doing, and I have been outright ignored and laughed at by people involved when I point out flaws. Because of this, I'm thinking of taking the next semester off to help my family with current financial issues. But if I do this that would make my prospective graduation May 2023, 7 years from when I started. I see people saying they graduated after 3.5 years and don't know if I'm doing this right at all and if I'll ever finish. Has anyone had a similar experience? Should I be worried? I'm doing the best I can but I don't know if that's enough. What are your thoughts?
