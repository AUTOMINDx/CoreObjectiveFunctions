AITA for brining my own food to a party because I couldn’t eat what was being served?
25m if that matters. Sorry for any spelling errors. Due to an injury I can only type with my non dominant hand right now. 

A family member had a re-signing party yesterday. I’m allergic to tomato and they were Ording Pizza from a place that doesn’t do pizza with white sauce. So I got food from somewhere else. I had planned to eat my food before more of the guests arrived but I got busy helping my SO and his sister with setting up so I ended up eating when everyone else was. 

I was eating the food on the couch. My boyfriend was outside and other people were getting some food. Someone’s kid saw me eating complained to their mum that I was eating something different. The mum came up to me and told me it was rude to eat something different in front of other people. She said it wasn’t fair to her son and now her son is asking why he can’t have what I was having. I told her that I have an allergy and her son wanted what I was having she could go pick that up for him. She said that I should eat it somewhere else and be more considerate of other people. AITA? 

I didn’t bring this up to my boyfriend or anyone else yet because i didn’t want to bring it up at the party , so I don’t know what their thoughts on it are.

Edit: not sure if it matters the hosts new I would be brining my own food.
