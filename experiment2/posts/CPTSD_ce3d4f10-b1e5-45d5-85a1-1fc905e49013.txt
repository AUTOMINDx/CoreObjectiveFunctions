It isn't the fear of abandonment. It is the suffering of waiting. Shows in opportunities not relationships. Anyone else experience this??
I see it like this:

I'm an infant. I have primal needs- eat, bathroom, sleep, love. I do not know I have these needs. My mom needs to attend to them. My mom needs to fulfill those needs. These needs are *primal,* so, it *feels* like **death** when deprived of the things that we need to survive.

Its this intense anxiety we feel today. It literally feels like there is no way out. We are helpless, and we don't even know what we need. We become that infant again.

I see it like this:

A "good enough mother" will hear their infant cry and naturally attend to their needs. They will love their infant consistently and reliably. 

A neglectful mother will hear their infant cry and ignore them. Or maybe they hear their infant cry and they are too busy doing drugs or whatever, so they end up attending to their infant hours later.

So the infant DOES get attended to, sometimes, for extended unknown long periods of time.

From my studies, I learned that "hope" is formed in infancy. The infant feels an innate "hope" when they have a need, before their mother meets it. They learn the value of hope, because it is what gets their needs met subconsciously. Its like an invisible force. 

When the mother doesn't attend to the infants needs consistently and reliably and lovingly- the hope lasts long. They hope their mom is going to come meet their needs- at some time or another. The hope is equated with **waiting** for mom. The waiting equates with the deadly anxiety above, because you are stuck in the middle- Am I going to die? Or am I going to survive? 

You can abandon me, that is okay. I just want to know that, so I can stop waiting. I can die. There is no suffering or waiting or hope. The anxiety is finally gone. What if an infant starved to death? There was long suffering between the time they needed to eat to the time they died. It would be easier to die in the beginning because then you wouldn't have to suffer. 

This is seen in my life today,

I HATE waiting. It does not matter what the context is- I always feel that anxiety.  I need certainty in my life. I need yes or nos. Like with a breakup, or taking a break with a boyfriend. I am stuck in the middle with the unknown, the waiting. I want to know: will we be together, so I can hold onto this hope? Or, will we not be together so I can cut the cord and die and disappear forever. These black and white routes ease anxiety within me. It is like this with everything in my life.  

Abandonment seems connected to the need for love. And this fear is projected onto relationships throughout life. Waiting seems connected to needs for food, diaper change etc. And this anxiety is projected onto life's opportunities.

I read and write about this stuff in attempt to help myself. When I regress back to infancy, and feel that deadly anxiety. I imagine a mother outside of myself, talking to this infant, meeting my needs in that moment. It helps.
