Was admitted to hospital for 3 days, is this all water weight from IV fluids? How long will it take to go away?

I had a gastric sleeve surgery about 6 months ago and have been losing weight but unfortunately I was admitted to the hospital last week for an unrelated illness, cyclical vomiting syndrome. I was admitted on Saturday and released Monday night. 

During this time I was being given IV fluids. When I went into the hospital I was 216 lbs but since returning I am 225 lbs. I wasn’t eating while in the hospital because I was there for a vomiting related illness, is this all IV fluids? I otherwise can’t fathom how I gained 10 pounds. 

Also I’m worried because I thought if it was water weight that it would have come off by now but it’s almost been a week since I’ve been out of the hospital and I still have retained all the weight.
