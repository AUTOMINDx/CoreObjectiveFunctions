Forgot to pay my restaurant tab
Hi, 

So I ate at a restaurant by myself. Staff was really nice and I enjoyed their food. After eating, I cleaned my table (put everything together), stood up, walked towards the restaurant's exit, struggled to push open the door, only to be stopped by a staff and be told that I haven't paid my bill yet. 

Jesus, I have completely forgotten that I was at a restaurant, not a fast-food chain. The staff was nice and handed me the bill, and I apologized, paid it and even gave him a generous tip, because it was embarrassing. 

When I got home, I called them and said sorry. They were nice and told me it was okay. 

I could not stop thinking about this. It was humiliating. My brain is really tired of thinking about so many things. ðŸ˜‘ I feel like disappearing.
