Considering leaving the family business
Hey everyone! I have personal experience leaving the family business, and I know how tough it can be to even *think* about leaving (almost feels like treason). I want to help people in similar situations who are either considering leaving or know they want to, but don't know how to do it without damaging relationships and/or finding their own path.

I'd love to start creating content (blog posts, etc.) diving into some topics around this difficult decision/transition. If anyone has been or is in a tough spot like this, I'd love for you to shout out what kind of topics would help you! Or even just what's bothering you/holding you back.

Thanks everyone, and remember, *the family business does not define you!*
