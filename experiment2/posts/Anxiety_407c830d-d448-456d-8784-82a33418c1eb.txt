Sometimes I just wish people would hear me
I don't like to take up a lot of space or call attention to myself, but sometimes I wish people would stop talking and just listen for a little while. 

No matter who I'm talking to, I'm taking a passive role and letting the other person dominate the conversation. Normally I don't mind, but I've been going through it recently, and want talk about stuff, only to discover I can't get a word in edgewise. The other person will say what they want, and I sit like a wall with ears, nodding and making appropriate noises at appropriate times. It makes me feel lonely, but what can I expect? I let people think that's just how I am, that's not their fault.

That's the reason I made a reddit account in the first place, and isn't that sad? Being so repressed that the only way you can talk about yourself is to a screen, hoping for some stranger's passing sympathy. No one knows about this account, and it's gonna stay that way. It's too pathetic to see the light of day.
