Why does living life, working, and exercising feel so pointless?
Like I do my exercise routine, go to my weekly squash games, go to work, maybe post a picture of my exercise outfit to my instagram story, then think about how my instagram is just all me and no friends because I guess all my friends have fucked off somewhere else over the course of the last 5 years...

Is this really it? We just spend our time trying to get life over with. My dating life is alright but nothing is forever. From time to time I meet someone great who helps me get through another 2 months by making life really fun but then after itâ€™s rinse and repeat and they are replaced by another person or a tv show perhaps.

Why do I hate being alive or something?
