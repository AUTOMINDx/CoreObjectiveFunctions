Does anyone deal with chronic dizziness/ feelings of unbalance?
I have been dealing with this for a year now. My hypochondriac brain goes straight to the possibility of having a brain tumor since I have been told that my dizziness is not coming from an inner ear problem. I ma getting an MRI of my brain in 7 days so I am kinda happy that I could finally put that worry to rest. But it been a hard couple days Bc all o do is research to help me remove the fear of having a brain tumor but I end up reading something that makes me feel worse
