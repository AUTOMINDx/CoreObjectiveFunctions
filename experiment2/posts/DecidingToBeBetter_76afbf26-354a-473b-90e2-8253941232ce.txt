I feel like i don't really want to get better
I know what im suppose to do so why don't I do it. To give some context im a 20 year old male highschool drop out that wants to go to school for Compsci. I quit my job a few months ago because i was just tired of being a dairy queen shift manager, my entire life ive battled with depression recently been diagnosed with bi polar schizoaffective disorder. I dont really hate myself when i look in the mirror, i dont think im an ugly person, but when i say i hate myself, i truly mean that about a good chunk of my psychology. I have always been reluctant of accepting other peoples help. I consistently made and make poor decisions in my life, knowing the outcome and what the consequences could be. Why do i even complain? Its as if this IS what i want and the only thing that comforts me, or gives me reassurance is my depression and the logic behind it. Ive never had to ask myself "why do i feel this way" rather "why do I keep doing this to feel this way". You remember farcry 3? Vlad said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results. Well if this is truly the case then everybody, including myself. Is probably right about me.
