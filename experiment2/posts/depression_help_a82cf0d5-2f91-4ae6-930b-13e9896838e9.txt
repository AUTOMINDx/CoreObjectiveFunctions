Exercising is great
I did 30 minutes of spinning, had a little bit of sweat and it feels great after the spinning. I felt a bit lightened, like the feeling I had when I woke up from a good night sleep. The feeling that the logic self knows that the intrusive thoughts and guilt feeling is not real. 

I hope we can all take some time exercising everyday
