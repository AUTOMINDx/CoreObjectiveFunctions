How can I feel beautiful when the internet wants a certain type of woman?
More in the sense of body type.


I'm envious of women with curves, plump butts and thighs that can suffocate the life out of anyone 


I am what's called an inverted triangle.


I have broad shoulders, and my waist and hips are narrow.

The only thing going for me are my long legs. But they are skinny..


I have a decent sized chest but I feel like a disgrace to my heritage. I'm Hispanic.


I tried exercises to maybe help shape my body into a more "thicc" shape. But I'm frustrated.

The saturation of thicc women with thunder thighs and booties so PHAT you can cry has been overwhelming.


I feel like that is a standard. Either you were blessed with an hour glass or pear body or not.


How can I help myself to feel more beautiful?
