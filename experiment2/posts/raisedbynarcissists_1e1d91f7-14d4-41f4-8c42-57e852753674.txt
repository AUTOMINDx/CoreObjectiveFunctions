My brother is having a baby
I haven’t spoken with my Nmom in 6+ months, but she messaged me a few days ago to let me know my older brother is having a baby. I know this would typically be happy news, but ever since I found out I’ve felt physically ill.

My grandfather was a horribly abusive man with an angry/sadistic streak, who passed it onto my father, then onto my brother. I want to hope that he would never hurt his own child, but I know what he’s capable of and he’s never made an effort to address any of his issues so it seems inevitable. I mean, he directly contributed to a lot of my childhood trauma and abuse.

Then add into the mix a narcissistic grandmother who’s ruined her relationships with her own children and likely sees this as her second chance, and a grandfather with a history of physical, verbal and sexual abuse… This baby hasn’t been born yet and already has so many cards stacked against it. 

It makes me so furious to see another child bought into this dysfunction and the cycle of abuse continuing. I can’t comprehend how people can be so selfish. Children don’t ask to be born - so don’t make that choice for them if you’re not prepared to be the best parent possible.
