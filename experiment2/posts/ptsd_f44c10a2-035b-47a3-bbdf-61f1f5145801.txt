I miss my old self before I was raped. I hate that he took so much more than I originally thought. I went to donate plasma today - and they told me I take too many medications for ptsd. Are you fucking kidding me? I can’t even donate plasma because of this stupid fucking condition. Nobody around me gets it either. I feel like such a burden. The flashbacks have been horrible recently and it’s not only embarrassing but it’s exhausting. I hate this so much. I found his (my rapists) stupid TikTok account. I am so afraid he is going to go viral. He doesn’t deserve it and I feel helpless.
