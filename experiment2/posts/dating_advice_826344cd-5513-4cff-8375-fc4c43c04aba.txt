Is it considered a red flag when someone wants to date you right after they stopped dating someone they liked?
I consider myself relatively new to casual dating, and the guy i’m seeing now told me that he stopped dating someone else two weeks ago. I kinda have a lot of emotional trauma from exes making me their rebound after they ended their previous relationships, that’s why i feel the need to ask people and make sure this is okay. 

But what do you guys think? Is this considered a red flag or am i being too uptight? I just don’t wanna feel like The Next Available Person all over again.
