Tired.
I’m just tired of everything. Tired of working long countless hours. Tired of faking a smile,  and hoping no one sees passed the part of me that enjoys making people laugh only to notice the darkness that lingers around me because I can’t trust anyone enough to let them see that side of me anymore. I just want the thoughts in my head to end.
