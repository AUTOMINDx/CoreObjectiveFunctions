Putting concept syllabi/other app materials on website?
Hi all!

I defended my PhD last year and am currently on the job market. I'm developing concept syllabi (i.e. for courses I haven't taught, but would like to) to include in my teaching dossier. Would it be odd to publish these on my website? My site already features syllabi for courses I've taught; I don't think that's unusual. But I'm not sure about courses that are purely hypothetical.

Relatedly, am I correct in thinking it'd be odd to put up research/teaching statements on my website? I haven't done this just because I haven't seen it on other academics' sites. Thanks so much for your advice.
