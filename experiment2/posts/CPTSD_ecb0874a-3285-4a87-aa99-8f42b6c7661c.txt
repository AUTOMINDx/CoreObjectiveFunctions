An OMG moment and trigger
I will probably delete this later. I know you guys will be cool so I will share this. Maybe I don't understand. Maybe it's stupid. I am watching the original Blade Runner. I am so damned triggered. Trying not to cry in front of my SO.  I have always loved this movie, identified with it. Thought it was the hero. But, I understand now. It's the Replicants. They have patchy memories, horrible pasts, and emotions are impossible for them, destructive.  They only exist. They have no one. They are lost. They live in fear. I knew this movie spoke to my soul and I just figured out why, I  think. Replicants are abused and exploited then expected to die or they get "retired" for fighting to live. We are like replicants in many ways - minus committing extreme violence. I am trying to understand this feeling.  Everyone in this movie is so twisted, the hero, the antihero - everyone. There is no good or bad. In the end one of the replicants comes to understand, saves a human, and loses his fear. He saves a human who would kill him and then just sits there and dies.
