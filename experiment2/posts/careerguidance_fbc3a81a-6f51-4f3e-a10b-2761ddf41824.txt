What careers would you have recommended?
I'm currently a junior in high school but completing an associate's degree at the same time. Nearly all my credits are accepted by most universities in Texas. However, the more I progress into CompSci, the more I feel depressed in it. I can't go into arts or animation because my family thinks it is useless and is not in demand. (aka Asian family). What careers should I do?
