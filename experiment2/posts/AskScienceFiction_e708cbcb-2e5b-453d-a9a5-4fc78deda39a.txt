[Spider-Man 2] Even acknowledging that Spider-Man is pulling his punches like he usually does, how is Otto Octavius able to withstand so many of Spider-Man’s attacks?
He’s a middle aged scientist who gets the ability to control four metal arms with his mind and no other superpowers.

Let’s assume this will also carry over to No Way Home where he’ll withstand THREE Spider-Men hitting him.
