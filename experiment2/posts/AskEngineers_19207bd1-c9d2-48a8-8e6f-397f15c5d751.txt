How do you get into management as a junior engineer?
I'm a computer science engineer and unfortunately I only took this education because laws here meant I could only do a master in computer science. I love tech theory but I hate programming more than anything in the world. 

At the moment I work in a huge IT consultant house and I'm looking for a new project. 

However, all I ever hear is how much they want me to code but I truly hate programming and I'm not good at it either.

I wanted to get into management for soooo long and I don't know how to. When I raise this people just shake their head "not for juniors". I know that I'm not gonna get senior responsibility from day one, but why can't I be hooked up with a product owner or something? I wanna do stakeholder management, learn about economy, talk with customers. I'm a terrible programmer but I understand tech and I'm great at talking with clients and customers. 

Is a big consulting firm the wrong place? Should I find a smaller place? How can I pivot my profile? I'm deeply unhappy in a programmer role and I avoid it at all costs. So many people are working in the software industry and seriously not everyone is a programmer. So I don't understand why I can't get to do more "soft" parts.
