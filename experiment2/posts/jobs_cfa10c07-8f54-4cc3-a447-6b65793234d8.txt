Looking to move careers, any advice would be greatly appreciated
So I have been working as a General Manger for the past 5 years at a corporate national chain. Lately they have been pushing us into doing more sales, but my heart has never been into sales. I always felt more passionate about merchandising. Plus, the company seems to be going in a direction I no feel I support. Ive been considering a career change but unsure of where to start. I was curious if anyone has worked for any great merchandise companies, or worked in a specific leadership department they enjoyed. Any suggestions?
