I am weak
I literally donâ€™t have what it takes to live on this planet. Like a total waste of space. I was doing so bad in high school the teachers literally had to curve my grades just so I could graduate on time. You could probably guess who my first semester of college went.

No girlfriend. No friends. No social life. This shit is fucking terrible and I cannot even cry because I have zero emotion and cannot push myself to.
