I've been working retail too long and it's killing my soul, how do I find an art career?
I'm an artist living right outside Atlanta. I know there's so many studios right next to me that do cartoons and comics but I don't know how to apply, or what I would even need with me. I'm autistic and have a hard time learning what I need to do without someone spelling it out for me.
