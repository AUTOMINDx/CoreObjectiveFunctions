Use photos on your profile that represent the way you look NOW - ie. The way you would look on a first date.. Not photos of the way you used to look or the way you wish you still looked.
I expect a lot of heat for this post... Sorry if it's upsetting to some people.

*Note: This makes me feel shallow as heck but you know what.. I don't like being misled and I want to feel physically attracted to the person I'm dating on top of being attracted to their personality.*

People age - the difference between 2 years can be fairly significant.. People get wrinkly, sagging skin, add a few more grey hairs, etc.

People gain/lose weight - old pictures showing a slimmer version of yourself is very misleading when in reality you're quite a bit larger. It wouldn't be an issue if you were up front about it.

Dudes (or ladies), if you're going bald, let a person know! Show at least one picture of your baldness. Yes, you might be insecure about it.. But it's important to let people know what to expect. Also, if you own it.. That's 100x more attractive than hiding it.

If you have any other features that you think or know may be surprising to someone just meeting you for the first time, let them know! You might not think it's a big deal and you might just want someone to "like you for you" but reality is, you are you and you includes your body and all your features.
