When does a Robinson Crusoe allegory break down?
I am a physicist, but as an amateur also very interested in macro economics.

Whenever I encounter a complex concept in this area, like a financial instrument, the housing market or externality problems, I try to imagine what this concept would mean on an isolated island with a few shipwrecked inhabitants trying to survive.

I imagine them bartering or using shells as currency, making promises (contracts) and trying to allocate resources either by market or using some power dynamics.

I have yet to encounter a concept that can't be visualized using this allegory.

Do you know of any economic event or concept where using this island would be a pretty bad idea? Not because it's unrealistic but the idea makes no sense at that scale or even leads to a false understanding?

For example, in physics the concept of temperature or pressure is meaningless for a small number of particles.
