the pain of shame
I want to ask for advice/perspectives/any help you can possibly give.

I am usually a pretty calm person but there are incidents where I can experience narcissistic rage. it's pretty rare and only happened twice in the past few years. but it's usually the same situation: I am vulnerable and trusting of someone and then I find out that person lied to me over a period of time and/or betrayed me with someone else.

something that anyone would be angry about I suppose. but the pain this specific situation brings me is so overwhelming, that it can almost immobilize me for a few days and usually drops me into a suicidal spiral and intense rage.
I don't let it out on anyone but it boils in me and kind of eats me from the inside

what hurts me the most is a) the fact that I was lied to and believed it and b) that there is another person they chose, that is "better" than me.

I'm pretty sure the reason this pain feels like it almost rips me apart physically is because the underlying emotion is shame. and thats like what npd is mostly based on.

the thing is, in these situations I have a very hard time coming out of it. when it happened in 2018 it took me about a year to function again. there was a S attempt and I had to go to a clinic for a few months. the anger only slowly subsided.

now I'm in a similar situation and everytime I think about it my nerves feel like they are filled with hot water. and thats basically constantly.

I am very angry but also resigned because I know I have no way to get "justice".

I try to deal with this in a logical way but as of right now it feels impossible. I can try to calm down a little but the second I think about it again the paralyzing pain comes back.

any tipps? insight? ways to deal with the chronic shame inside us?
