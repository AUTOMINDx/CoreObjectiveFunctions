My (21M) gf (22F) dad raped her and is still important in her life, and wants me to act like nothing ever happened with him
So to keep things short and sweet, she recently opened up to me and her family about the abuse. It destroys me that the family still stayed together almost as if nothing happened. Before her opening up to all of us, mind you the abuse was 5 years ago, i would see her at her house, go every few days, hangout with the dad and mom, drink a few beers, maybe watch a movie. Since she told all of us, i havent been to her house. Ive picked her up once since then. All these other times we’ve hung out, she comes to my place and then we’ve gone out.

Yesterday she told me that she doesnt want to lose me. That she loves me, but she also still wants her dad in her life. That, and i quote “want him to walk me down the aisle, want him to see our future kids.” I had told her before that if she wanted the relationship to work, that i would not allow him to see our kids in the future and that he would not be their grandfather. I love her, with everything i got. She makes me the best version of myself. I just dont know how to handle the relationship between me and the dad. I asked if things are back to normal in her household and she told me yes. And that she does want me to go see her, to spend time with them again. She went as far as to say if i could just ask as if nothing ever happened.

This just seems like an impossible task for me. And i feel like i will always be uncomfortable around him now. I hate what he did. I feel like i wouldnt be able to hide the anger i have towards him. And i dont want to create more issues in between them either. Is it possible for things to go back to “normal”? A point where i can not necessarily forget what he did to her but to accept it and move on?
