How long will my life be ruined
Trigger warning for vets. Will be talking about explosions and death. 

I’m very young and a “combat veteran”.  I’m in therapy after traumatic events from deploying to the Middle East that include rocket attacks and seeing two people die.My therapist says it will take time to get better. But how much time? I’m suffering. I’m an extroverted person but now I’m the opposite and people notice and ask all the time. They know I’m crazy in the head. But they don’t get it. They don’t get it that I want to be normal just as bad as they want me to be. I feel like I’ve been cheated out of life. How can I go back home to my wife like this? I love her but I can’t stand to think that I’m not gonna come back as the person she loves. I’ve never thought about killing my self because I’m afraid of dying. Absolutely terrified of it. But sometimes I think maybe it would be better If I did die in that attack that day. Guess I’m venting. Sorry.
