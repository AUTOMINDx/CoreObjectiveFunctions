Is it a bad idea to get a PhD in philosophy?
I’ve been debating which graduate degree to get for years. I have an undergrad degree in French, and I’ve bounced around in ideas, thinking about getting a grad degree in Linguistics, social work, French, TESOL, on and on. The main issue for me is passion vs financial security. The things that would give me the most job options are uninteresting to me, and the things that do interest me…not a lot of career options. It’s not that I need to make a lot of money, to be clear. It’s the fear that I’ll get the degree and not be able to support myself at a minimum and pay off my debt, if I can’t find a job. 

Philosophy seems like the worst fit for this! It’s not a versatile degree! But it’s the most interesting to me. I know I love language, and I think studying philosophy of language would be fascinating. My mind works very abstractly, I love the theoretical and abstract, and I love living an examined life. I think it might be the perfect fit. 

When I think about what I would think about my life when I’m nearing my end, I don’t want to think, “man, I paid off that debt fast. I really bought a lot of good stuff, too.” I want to think, “I tried to understand. I didn’t go blindly through this life. I didn’t focus just on the money. I really wanted to live an examined life, and I did.” And I also want to feel like I excelled at something. And I think I would excel in academia, in this field. 

Yet, money is a thing. Lol. 

Any thoughts? Especially from people studying or working in philosophy?
