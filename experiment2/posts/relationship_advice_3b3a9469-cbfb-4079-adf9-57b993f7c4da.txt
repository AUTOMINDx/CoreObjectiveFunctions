My husband drank a bit and later cried about being hurt by his ex best friend (girl) a person who he liked for years… not sure what to think
Long story short, my husband cried over his old best friend. We will call her Nicole. 
Him and Nicole were friends for several years and after dating other people (he liked her throughout the years) he said he came back and was friends with her and he waited to get her to like him back after that. 

He said after he finally got Nicole to like him, she stopped talking to him a few months later and dated another guy. 

He was incredibly angry and hurt about this. This happened a couple years ago. 

Fast forward to this past weekend, he finds out Nicole’s boyfriend cheated on her and he confides in me. Cried and said he’s tired of feeling and hurting because of someone who was supposed to care about him since they were friends for so long. 

He said he’s glad he could talk to me about it and that he feels better after talking to me and getting it off his chest. He said he didn’t realize he was hurting about it. 
I comforted him a lot and I hated seeing him sad but now he’s fine and I’m just left feeling a bit weird. I mean I trust him, he’s my husband but I just feel kinda of off that he was crying about an old girl friend. 
Maybe I’m being selfish
