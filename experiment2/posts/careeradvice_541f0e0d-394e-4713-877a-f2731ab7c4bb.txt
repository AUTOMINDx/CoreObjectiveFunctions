What are some good programs post UG (except MBA) to change career path? Basically I don’t want to write the GMAT exam.
(27 F) I have been on the GMAT journey for quite a while now and I feel like I’m getting nowhere even with great material. This is making me think if I should actually pursue an MBA. 
I currently work at a big aerospace company as a data analyst (started out as a mechanical design engineer) and I’ve been with this company for 6 years in various roles in two countries. 
I want a push to my career and want to get into a more generalist role. Is there a way to get there without doing an MBA? 
Looking for programs particularly in Canada.
