Do you treat contractors differently that your “actual” coworkers?
I work as a 3rd party engineering contractor for a large pharma company in New England. I kind of notice that my manager (who is an actual full time employee) treats contractors poorly as compared to his peers. It is strange, since we are both chemical engineers and I have seen this trend with others as well. Is it normal for actual employees to be condescending towards contractors?
