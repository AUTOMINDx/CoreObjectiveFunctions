Isopropyl alcohol is conductive in the MOhms range
Yesterday I was cleaning a motherboard with it, and troubleshoting a malfunction. and it stopped to power on. After sometime I gave up, and went online and bought another one with processor and RAM.

A couple hours ago I tried to turn it on, and it just worked fine. I guess the Isopropyl was somehow still not all dry yesterday. :(

It says 99.5% purity on the label
