I did it. I had a good damn day yesterday
There was definitely a moment of depression because of someone else, BUT for the most part, damn it was a productive day.

I did the dishes, laundry, I cleaned some stuff up in my office, I drove to an appt on time, I cooked, I cleaned my fish tanks.

Wow. Just did so much.

I’m still deeply depressed but damn, I got stuff done. I’m not giving up on myself and I hope you don’t too.

I’m feeling really shitty today, but I’m gonna eat, take some Tylenol and go run some errands.

I’ll be sad and depressed but I won’t stay still!
