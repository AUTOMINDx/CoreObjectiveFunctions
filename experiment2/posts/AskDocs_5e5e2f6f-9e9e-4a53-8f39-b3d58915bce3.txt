What does a medically-supervised fentanyl detox look like? (30M)
I just got the news that my ex-boyfriend of five years is addicted to fentanyl. It got pretty bad: he’s being evicted, was living in physically unsafe conditions because of how dirty everything was, began participating in home robbery, hung out at homeless encampments…

Apparently he’s been using opioids for the past three years, even when we were together, and I had no idea. He’s been using fentanyl (something about smoking pills with tinfoil…? I know nothing about drugs…) and I was painted a pretty bleak picture. My heart is breaking for him :( 

30M, gained about 50 pounds since he’s been using, 6 foot, cigarette smoker. About a year of heroin use and 5 months of fentanyl use. Alcohol addiction as well. 

He’s now at a medical detox center. I’m wondering if anyone could give me some insight on what this looks like, and what he might be going through? How long could he be there? He has state insurance, but found a place that accepted it, and checked in the same day. He went there willingly, but I don’t know if they can make him stay there or if he’s free to leave. Is he in a lot of physical pain? Will they help him with that? 

I’m so concerned for him. We haven’t spoken, his aunt called to tell me. Any information would be so helpful.
