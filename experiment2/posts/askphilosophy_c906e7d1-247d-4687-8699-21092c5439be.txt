What Is Evolutionary Monism?
I'd never encountered this term before but apparently it's associated with Herbert Spencer &amp; Ernst Haeckel. I'm choosing to post here instead of a science subreddit because it came up in a reading I'm doing about philosophical traditions &amp; since this reads as a more philosophical foundation for evolutionary theory, I figured I'd ask here first. Just an overview would be ideal though if I can get a paper or two discussing this, that too would be appreciated for later reading.
