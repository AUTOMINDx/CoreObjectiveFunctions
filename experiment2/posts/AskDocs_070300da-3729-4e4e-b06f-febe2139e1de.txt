[25][Female] is it possible for your vein to be.. swollen?
Hello. 
As the title says, I’m wondering if this is possible. I’ve been having pain in My right arm for about a month, as well as mysterious bruising. And then yesterday I discovered what felt like a swollen vein? I’m not sure if that’s exactly what’s happening, but it’s in the inside of my right arm ( the area that mainly hurts ) and it’s a line that goes from the upper part of inner arm down to that inside of my elbow (I’m also not sure if that’s what it’s called, but it’s the folding part lol ) 

I was just wondering if anyone knows what is happening here. I also think I could have  hidradenitis suppurativa and I’m concerned I have a terrible infection or something but can’t for the life of me find a dermatologist in my area that takes my insurance
