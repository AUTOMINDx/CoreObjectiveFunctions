How do I stop overthinking social interactions?
I am a really bad over thinker. Recently I saw someone I knew at the bus and she said hi to me. Ofc I couldn’t just ignore her so I said hi back and we started to talk a little.
The interaction was normal but I messed up twice.

Once was when I asked if she had new glasses cause it seemed new. And she said no, she’s had them for awhile. And I said it must’ve been because I haven’t seen her in awhile then. Looking back, the last time I saw her was beginning of November which isn’t even a long time ago. 

The second time was when I said I always think I see her around campus cause I’d see people with her hair. She said “bruh”. But I think I came off as rude. I don’t want it to come off as her hairstyle is generic. 

Lastly, I know I’m overthinking. She probably doesn’t even think that and she’s just like “oh I saw this person today” but STILL, each time I try to rationalize it, I just can’t help but critique myself
