(Seeking career Advice ) Which career i should focus on ?
I am (30M ) Last year i have  finished “Master of Cybersecurity “ from Australia over this year i have been applying for numerous jobs on either companies job board or job sites such as (seek and indeed) , but i always get rejected . I know almost 80% of my rejection because i am not a citizen nor a PR holder and the other half because i don’t have the experience nor industrial certifications.   

I truly don’t know what should i do now . I am trying now to apply by my bachelor degree which was in mechanical engineering , but I don’t know if I would be able to land a job in this field. Note: ( I don’t have practical experience in mechanical either) .  

I am seeking an honest advice on what I should focus on or do
