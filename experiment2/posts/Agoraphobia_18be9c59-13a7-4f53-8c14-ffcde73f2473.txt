Advice on getting a dog
Hi friends! I would really love to get a dog, but of course am worried that my agoraphobia may prevent me from being a good owner. I would love to have a companion while I work from home and am able to take short walks near my apartment building, but am worried about taking it to the vet, groomed, etc. Does anyone have any advice on owning a dog while overcoming agoraphobia? I do not think I can afford to get an official ESA dog, but I would love to hear about anyones experiences with them. Thanks in advance :)
