I’m conflicted on the path I want to take?
I currently work for the Government as a contractor in data analytics. I’m making almost 70k. I’m conflicted on what to do for my next step after I finish my bachelors degree.

I’ve made a lot of connections in the Government and have a lot of options in terms of easily earning a civilian position. I could go into contracting and be a buyer. Learn a lot of valuable skills in contracts, contract negotiation, etc. 

I could go into program management (once again, in the government sector). 

Or I could venture straight out into the private sector/away from Government work and not have to take a pay cut like I would with being a civilian. 


-Do you think it’d be wise to stick with the Government for the benefit of learning valuable skills in contracts or program management? 

-Or would it be more valuable to go out into the private sector/away from Government work right after I graduate?
