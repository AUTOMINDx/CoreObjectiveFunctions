My first job was a failure, what to do?
I moved to the U.S. to take this job and I totally flopped....most people say I'm doing fine but I know I can do a lot better than this. I have been here 8 months now and I see no light at the end of the tunnel. 2 months in I got a new manager and we never got along. We speak maybe every month and a half if that. I lost passion for my degree (engineering) and so it reflects on the job. My department lost like 70% of its people due to quitting or moving to other areas. I've been sticking it out for months just to get to that first year but now it feels like I'm really crawling there and I still have 4 months to go. Luckily December will go by fast because of the holidays. 

My performance at the start was amazing because it was just stress driving me. After 4 months it kind of wore off and it started dropping slowly. 1 month ago I just kind of let go and then it dropped precipitously. I am pretty much coasting at this point (if that). I am working on transferring to another job in the same company but its doubtful that they will let me move. What to do?
