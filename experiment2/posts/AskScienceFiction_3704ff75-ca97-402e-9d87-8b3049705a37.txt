[Silence of the Lambs] Could Starling have fired a round to get backup?
I completely understand her not taking the time to dial for another cop. But instead of doing that could she have just fired a round into the ground, and pray one of the neighbors hears it and dials 911 for her?

It may not work but it doesn't really cost her anything,  it takes maybe two seconds and one bullet and she has additional rounds.

The only thing I can think of is the chance of a ricochette but it shouldn't be that hard to find something which will stop a bullet.
