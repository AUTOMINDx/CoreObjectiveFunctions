Am I actually showing signs of progress?
I don’t know, I think I might be improving. I felt a bit better today, I didn’t have an anxiety attack, I was somewhat outgoing, and I haven’t woken up with anxiety for the past couple weeks. I could be getting better possibly. Sadly, I don’t wanna get my hopes up too much, but, I don’t know, I feel okay right now, it’s great! I pray that this keeps going! There’s still some stuff I need to work on though (anxious triggers).
