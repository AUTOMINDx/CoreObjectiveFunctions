Is it frowned upon to use cover letter builders?
As somebody who is only a few years into the job market, I struggle to write a good cover letter. I was wondering about using a cover letter builder to assist me, but I'm not sure what the general consensus is on these. 

While I'm intending to change some of the information to be more relevant to the position and my experience, some paragraphs are perfectly fine as they are and require little adjustment.

Is this something that employers are likely to dislike or is it generally ok to use these sorts of websites?
