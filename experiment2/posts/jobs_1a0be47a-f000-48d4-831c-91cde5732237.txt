Deadass need another job
I get paid $14/hr but I'm really tired of working outside pushing carts and doing stocking inside. Like it's gotten to a point that I'm gonna go insane if I can't find anywhere to work. An office job is a haven to me rn I'd love to just sit back and do some data entry instead of sweating my ass off and getting looked down upon and yelled at by customers.
