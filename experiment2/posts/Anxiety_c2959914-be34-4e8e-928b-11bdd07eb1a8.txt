Fear of driving is ruining my life
I’m 24 without a drivers license. I had a traumatic thing happen while I was first learning how to drive at 17 which has caused me to never drive again. I was already scared of driving before that event, and then what happened kinda reaffirmed all of my fears. 

That being said, I’m a real adult now and not being able to drive is no longer very feasible for many reasons. I can get away with it, but it is just very impractical and makes life 10x harder. What sucks is that, while I am anxious I am also extremely stubborn and will resist facing my anxieties until I’m absolutely forced to. Since I can technically get away without driving, I can skate by without having to face my fears. 

If you’ve had driving anxiety, what has helped you? What has helped you face anxious situations in general? Obviously I can’t take medication while driving, but I would if I could HAHA
