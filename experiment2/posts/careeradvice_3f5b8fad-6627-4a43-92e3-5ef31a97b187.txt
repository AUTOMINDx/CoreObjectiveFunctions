Real talk: How to get a manager job and get ahead in corporate when no one gives you a chance to manage others? How do you get people to trust you can do the job?
I’ve been in recruiting/HR for 11 years and at this point in my career I should be at a manager or director level and gotten to a point where I’m managing others. I haven’t been in roles where I HAVE gotten to manage others (been a contractor, been in orgs that have been in mergers/acquired so no personnel changes, etc). Now when I apply for jobs or get in a new job, I feel like I have a scarlet letter on my forehead and no one will consider me for manager roles because I haven’t done it already. How am I supposed to get a manager job if no one gives me a chance in the first place?? I’ve managed others on project teams in the past, managed others in a nonprofit setting, managed others when I worked in the restaurant industry previously for years, but no one’s giving me the chance to manage now. Am I just stuck? How do I present myself as management ready?
