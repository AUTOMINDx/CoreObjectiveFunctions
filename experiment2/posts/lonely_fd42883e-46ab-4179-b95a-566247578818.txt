I'm neurodivergent, today is my birthday and none of my friends remember it. I just wish I could have a beautiful birthday for once.
I've been bullied all my life and my condition made it even worse to connect with others. Growing up, I struggled a lot socially and I still do. I try my best to be considerate to others and I always remember my friends' birthdays, but they never remeber mine. I wish things were different and there was at least one friend to celebrate my birthday with me. That's all folks. Thanks for reading this.
