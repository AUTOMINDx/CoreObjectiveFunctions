AITA for refusing to buy the class photograph when my son isn’t in the picture?
My son is 6; last month they took the traditional class picture. Unfortunately, both my so and his “girlfriend” were confined at home as contact cases of a confirmed Corona case; per our country’s policy.

The next day, we got an e-mail promising the absent kids would be photoshopped into the picture.

A week ago, we received the order form for the picture, with an example photo posted at the school pick up area. Neither DS or his friend were included. Apparently, it turned out to be “too much work” to add all the absent kids.

So I didn’t return the form; figured that would be it. Now his teacher is mailing me at ask which of the 2 versions of the picture we want. When I replied neither since my son isn’t in the picture; she pretended to not know “where I heard he would be included.”

I don’t want to be a Karen demanding they photoshop him and GF in properly (or just add their pictures separately); but if he isn’t in it, then I don’t want the picture either. We’ve got plenty of pics with his classmates from his birthday party; so it isn’t like he’s have no tangible memories from this year either.

I felt justified in my decision, but his teachers insistence makes me think this stuff isn’t as optional as I thought it was. Also, my son asked me to buy it; *because his teacher told him to ask me*.


So, AITA for not buying the picture?
