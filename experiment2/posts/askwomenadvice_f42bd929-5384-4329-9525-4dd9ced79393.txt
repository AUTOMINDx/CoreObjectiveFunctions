What should I do about this?? (friendship) Age- 15 Gender-she/her
Every friendship I’ve ever had never really worked out. It’s not like anyone did anything bad, it’s just we grew apart. I’m scared that the friendship my my best friend will die out. We always knew of each other and we’re friends, but recently we’ve both gotten into this school and became closer, and best friends. I don’t want to lose this her because she I somone I can count on, I know I can trust her with my life but I don’t know if she feels the same way anymore. Like before thanksgiving break, I would ask her to hangout numerous times (span of 1 month) and she would cancel last minute, but during school me and her were always together, and the only person she would talk to was me. During thanksgiving break she texted me saying she was thankful for me and that she loves me. After break she’s been cold and distant. I don’t know if I’ve done anything to her, if somthing is wrong, etc. but I don’t want to lose her if I’m just trying to pull something out of nothing, just pure worrying
