When to follow up after informal but seemingly promising job discussion?
Posting on my phone from a throwaway and keeping things vague! 

I’m currently an Assistant Professor (non-TT) in STEM at a private R1 in the northeast. For a variety of reasons, both personal and professional, I want to leave. At this point, I’m honestly fine with leaving academia if I could live where I want to and have better quality of life. But ideally I’d prefer to stay in and am fine with non-TT jobs. 

About 3 weeks ago on a whim I reached out to a colleague who recently left my institution for a promotion at a university in the state that I really want to move to. The conversation went better than I was ever expecting. They went through similar issues that I’m going through so understood where I was coming from and my desire to move for my personal life too. They are hiring for their lab and sounded very optimistic about the ability to bring me on. They even asked about potential timing and when would be ideal for me to leave, and we talked about strategy and keeping cards close to the vest until the time is right, etc. I say all that as context that it was a relatively concrete conversation and not just BSing with each other. They were going to be meeting with their chair soon and asked for my CV, which I sent right after the call.

I’m sure I’m being overly eager so I wanted to get the group’s wisdom on when to reach out again. I know there are a million part to these things that move at a glacial pace and when they asked about my time frame, I said the beginning of the 2022 academic year, which is obviously a ways off. But I’m just so over my current situation and literally replay our conversation in my head everyday. 

I was thinking maybe a brief check in email or text (I have their personal contact info) after the New Year. Does that sound reasonable?
