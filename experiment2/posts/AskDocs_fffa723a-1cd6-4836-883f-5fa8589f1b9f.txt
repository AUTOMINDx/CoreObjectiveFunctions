Uncomfortable poops for several days, today I had a tiny bit of blood when I pooped.
Several days ago, probobly like ten ish, I had a hard time pooping. Not crazy hard, just sorta firm  and mildly uncomfortably like it sometimes is. What was weird is that it was like that p much every day. and afterwards it always felt like the left side was still tense, and the entrance was kind of itchy. Today its was a tiny bit painful going, and when i wiped there was a tiny bit of redness on the paper. What is going on and should I be worried?

I have been crazy anxious and panicking the past couple weeks (mental health issues I'm seeing a therapist about), and thats definitely been messing up my digestion. Could it be related?

I'm not particularly privy to add a photo but if it really helps I guess I can send???

update: the tiny bit of blood was about 5:45 pm. I've just looked and it seems like im still bleeding a little bit. how bad is that? Its currently 630

update 2: its ab 8 now, idk when but its stopped bleeding
