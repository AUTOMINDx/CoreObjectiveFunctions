Career options for tired misanthropes?
I'm currently looking to make a career change and I'm willing to go back to school to do it (no degree). I've been in the workforce for about 10 years now, mostly customer-facing jobs. In that time I've learned two things about myself:

1) I no longer wish to work with the public;

and 2) my joints will not tolerate a lifelong career in manual labor, so trade school is out.

I don't *hate* humans and am unwilling to do anything that hurts them, like crime or investment banking. I'm just far more introverted than I thought and have expended all of my patience with humanity. Ideally I wouldn't even be working with more than a small number of coworkers (preferably none). I don't need people to keep me on track or motivated - in fact, a lot of meddling from management or others makes my work worse. Just give me clear objectives, leave me alone, and you will get your stuff.

It's the joint thing, however, that's made a career change necessary. After years of retail and restaurants, basically everything from the hips down is shot. Losing weight and the best work shoes my meager wages can buy have not helped. More than likely I've simply jumpstarted what will be a lifelong battle with arthritis. I MAYBE have enough endurance left to work my way through 4 years of college but that's it. After that I need to spend at least half my work day in a chair. Working from home would be even better, but you can't get everything.
