Why do adults act condescending to kids and still expect kids to like them?
THIS. I've never in my life understood why adults act condescending towards children and don't see how that is simply not the way to go about things. I mean, don't they remember what's like being a child? I witness this far too many times, like how older relatives talk to younger relatives (and I'm talking about pre-teens here) as if they are stupid. Using that voice that you use to talking to pets, not treating them as equals in a conversation, constant interruptions, not taking their ideas seriously... the list goes on. Later they're left wondering why the kids don't like interacting with them.

Man, I remember DESPISING that behavior from grownups as a kid. It just made me hate them, so I've always been confused when people do that and act as if it won't have any negative consequences. To be frank, I don't like kids that much but I'm usually a kid magnet at social events and I've noticed that it might be because I treat them like I treat any other person and they seem to respect and like me way more than they do with other adults. So if you're trying to interact positively with a kid (or your own) why not treat them like humans, no better or worse than yourself? It's not rocket science, **kids see RIGHT through your bullshit, just saying.**
