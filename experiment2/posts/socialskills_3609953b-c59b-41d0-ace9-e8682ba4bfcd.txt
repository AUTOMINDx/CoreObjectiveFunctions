How to shut down a competitive single friend
There's a women I've been getting to know over the past year and up until today, I thought she was pretty chill. She's almost 30 years older than me, single, college education, well traveled, and very independent. The few times we've hung out, we've either been in the company of other women  or just with each other and she seemed normal. Today I brought a guy friend over (he's also 30 years younger) and she was so rude. Anything I said, she'd have a snarky, condescending remark but she talked my friend's ear off asking him all kinds of questions and was super interested in everything he had to say. I'm pretty sure she had a little crush on him......At least, up until she mentioned she went on this vacation in 1990 and he mentioned he was in diapers around that time.

At one point, my friend paused to check his phone and said to me "Oh, my mom wanted us to stop by"  so I responded with "Oh, okay"

She then snapped at me "Oh what? You don't want to hang out with me?" while staring directly at me as if I was the one who suggested we leave. 

 It was very uncomfortable. At one point, she didn't even notice I stopped talking. The funny thing is, this is the second time I've encountered a woman like this: sweet as pie with me/rude in the company of men. 

I mentioned all this to my guy friend when we left and he felt bad I wasn't having a good time and did think some stuff she said to me was kind of off.

It was very disappointing. I don't know why I keep encountering people like this. How should I handle this in the future? Should I cut her out of my life like I did the first person? Is there a way to shut this behavior down?
