I'm increasingly uncomfortable with the lack of financial transparency in my new company - what now?
I'm about two months in to a job where I supposedly have a "senior leadership" position. I have no insight into my employees' pay rates, vacation accrual, reported hours, calendars, software or partnership budgets... anything, really. We are having trouble figuring out what we previously billed for some things before I joined. I've never worked somewhere that doesn't have simple budgeting and billing figured out.  


I'm being asked to evaluate an employee's contribution to the company vs. a vendor, and there's no information being given to me about what they are paid, alongside the other problems. I'm being highly compensated, but I can't resolve any issue right now, and I'm not even sure everything is above board. Should I consult an employee adjacent to me to see how they feel? Confront my boss? Just let things work themselves out?   


I have to sleep on this, but any advice is appreciated.
