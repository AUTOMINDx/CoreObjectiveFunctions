Finding Closure
Just a reminder to everyone, no matter what happened to lead to the break up, I feel everything should be talked out and left on the table so if you two do decide to permanently go your separate ways you know what things you could possibly have to work on for yourself or your next relationship. Just don’t leave your partner wondering what they did wrong or could’ve done better, they’ll never find the answer because it lies within you, allow them to find closure and in the end it’ll be better for both of you.
