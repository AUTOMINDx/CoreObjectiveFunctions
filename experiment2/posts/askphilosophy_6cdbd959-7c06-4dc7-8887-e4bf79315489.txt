Collective Responsibility in Virtue Ethics
Is there a concept of collective responsibility in virtue ethics? The way I see it, collective responsibility is debated in many utilitarian circles because they start from consequences. You can look at who was responsible for a certain consequence and then ask if there is such a thing as collective responsibility. 

With virtue ethics, it seems as if the individual being the good person is the starting point, so the question of collective responsibility shouldn't be raised because it starts from individual responsibility which might culminate in collective action.

Is this right? Is there a way to conceive collective responsibility in virtue ethics? How would that look like?

I am very interested in any papers or books you might have on the topic. Thanks in advance!
