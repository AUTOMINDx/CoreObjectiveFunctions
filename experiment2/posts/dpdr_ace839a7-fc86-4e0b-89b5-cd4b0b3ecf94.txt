HELP! Visual disturbances. Do I have Dpdr or psychosis??
I’ve had pretty bad fluctuating dpdr since ending a pharma drug in July that I had an extremely negative reaction to (worse panic attack of my life felt dpdr for the first time) Things seem to come and go but recently I’ve felt more disconnected than I ever have and have been experiencing weird visual issues. When I look at text it seems to be warping some what (moving up down left right) and if I look at a photo on my phone it also seems to move. For example if someone’s arm in a photo is moving upwards my brain will make it look like the arm is continuing to move up for 1/2 a second. This issue really only seems to happen while I’m on my phone. The text thing doesn’t bother me too much as I’ve read that this happens to others, but the images moving in ways my brain thinks the would be moving scares the fuck out of me. Any advice??? I’m scared I might have psychosis or something.

For reference my dpdr is characterized as having a detachment from reality (understand that this is not how other people experience things), extreme visual snow, don’t recognize myself in the mirror, memories don’t feel attached to me, feel like I’m not actually experiencing reality but rather watching it unfold from behind a display. And now the issues I mentioned above.
