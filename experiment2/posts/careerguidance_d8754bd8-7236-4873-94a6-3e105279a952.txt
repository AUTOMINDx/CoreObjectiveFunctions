What are some good jobs that don't require much knowledge, but a lot of logical thinking and problem solving?
I've turned 30 and wasted most of my life so far half assly chasing wet dream in arts and humanities. That didn't pay off, but I transitioned to Software and been doing alright and enjoying it for the past year, however I'm lacking skills compared to younger folks with IT background. I can solve problems and fix stuff easily, but it's rarely "best practice".

My main skill is problem solving, but not fast learning or people skills. How can I steer my career to make most of it?
