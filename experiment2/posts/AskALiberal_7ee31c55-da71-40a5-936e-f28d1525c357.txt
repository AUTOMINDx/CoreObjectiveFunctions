Do you think politicians being able to invest in companies they can legislate contributes to distrust of government officials?
EG - When covid first started getting reported, senators downplayed the impact of it. Later they received a classified briefing, sold their investments in some areas and bought in others, and then began giving more serious information to the public on covid.

This was all completely legal, and really not even that abnormal. Legislators have always been able to invest in companies that they legislate.

Do you think this is something that causes distrust of the government? Specifically, could a reasonable person not trust what government officials are saying in regards to covid?
