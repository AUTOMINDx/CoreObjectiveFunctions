How do you respond when an older person comments on how handsome you are?
I am a young adult and occasionally I’ll meet a friend of my parents or grandparents and they’ll comment on how handsome I am or how handsome I’ve gotten. It’s very nice of them but it always leaves me feeling super uncomfortable as I don’t really know how to respond. I usually say something to the likes of “Aw, thank you!” But it tends to be followed with an awkward smile and silence. Is there a better way for me to respond to this sort of thing?
