An idea..we’re living the dream life
Chances are if you’re reading this, using your phone or a computer to check Reddit, even on this sub page…you’re living somebody’s dream life. 

Anyway, I thought it might be interesting to hear your irrational anxieties…for instance: I’m going on a three week trip to another country. I should be soo excited, and parts of me are, but other parts are so hard wired after years of anxiety, that can you believe I’ve actually spent the last few days with bouts of panic, sobbing, etc. worries about leaving my dogs with my folks, my depressed mom, missing Christmas. It’s not that these worries are entirely irrational—it’s just that if it wasn’t this it would be something else. I’m incredibly fortunate, generally speaking and especially with this fun trip.  

I’ll always find something to be overwhelmed and anxious by. I work to rewire my brain with meditation for two years now and have come so far, but the work will never be over.
