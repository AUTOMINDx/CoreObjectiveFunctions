I [M24] haven’t had a morning or random erection for years, is this a concern?
I cannot remember the last time I woke up erect, or experienced a random erection. In my teenage years they were regular. I also do not have the highest sex drive, maybe once a week I feel capable of having sex which compared to many my age is not often, my penis even when erect feels softer than it used to be. When I ejaculate my sperm is also very watery, I have never had the typical thicker white type  you see in porn (I’m aware that porn is not the best comparison). Are these symptoms a concern for my physical health? I don’t seem to have any control over them so struggle to see it being psychological. 

Worth mentioning I am not overweight, or ant any other medical conditions. I am 6ft 81KG and reasonably fit.
