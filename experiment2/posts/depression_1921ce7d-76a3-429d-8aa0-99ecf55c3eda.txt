I’m pregnant living with a depressed partner
Hi all, as the title states, I’m pregnant (6 months) living with a depressed partner. I’m trying my hardest to be strong, and not take it personally, but my pregnancy hormones are all over the place and just want to constantly cry. He has finally spoke to a doctor and we are receiving couples counselling which really helps. Im trying my best to give him space (we live in the same house so is tricky) it’s just so hard not to take him been so ‘off’ with me personally. any advice for this please?
