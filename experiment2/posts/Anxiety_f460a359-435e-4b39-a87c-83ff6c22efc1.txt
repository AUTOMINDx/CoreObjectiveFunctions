I feel like I will never be normal again
Anxiety and depression is taking over my life. I’m so scared to fall asleep and wake up in a panic state. Every little thing triggers my anxiety, whether my heart is palpitating, or my shoulder had a small pain or my stomach is feels acidy. I feel like I’m living my life like I’m watching a movie. I’m here but not really. It’s been like this for a year now, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried exercising, just do deal with social anxiety and insecurities. I’ve tried reading, but I don’t really read. Baking, cooking, everything but nothing brings me joy. I feel like I’m failing my daughter, because I’m not really in the moment. I feel like I’m acting. I just want to get better.
