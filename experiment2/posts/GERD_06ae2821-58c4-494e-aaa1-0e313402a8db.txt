Help
I feel I should preface this by saying I have health anxiety due to a complication during pregnancy and am very overweight. 

My dad suffers from diagnosed GERD and I believed that before I was pregnant I suffered with it too, I would always have to cough constantly after eating dinner and felt like I couldn’t clear my throat and was prone to having heartburn. Once pregnant it all stopped but my throat was in agony, long story short I was diagnosed with silent reflux. Post pregnancy thought the GERD like symptoms would return but nothing did. 

Fast forward 2 years to the end of last month and I developed a seasonal sore throat/cough after my husband and daughter caught it. About halfway through the cough I started getting the odd heart palpitation and pressure and tickle in chest. It started by being present when bending/moving around then stopped being related to exertion and just happened randomly. Mostly when at rest or at an increased frequency if on my own. Saw the doctor who arranged for an ECG which came back clear (I didn’t feel any chest discomfort at the time of the test) the doctor then felt given my history that it was anxiety related. She asked me to keep a two week diary of the palps and prescribed me propranolol which I didn’t get on with at all. Went back to the doctor after keeping the diary and she read it and still wasn’t concerned but asked me to take the propranolol and this time prescribed me 40mg of omeprazole as my cold cough was getting worse after eating. 

Does anybody else suffer from sporadic palpitations/ chest discomfort that happen at rest and get better when eating or drinking or coughing? My health anxiety has me in overdrive.
