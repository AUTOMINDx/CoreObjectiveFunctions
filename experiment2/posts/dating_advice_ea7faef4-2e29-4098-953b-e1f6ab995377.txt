It turns me off when a girl shows too much interest and i hate myself for it
There's this girl that always messages me and wants to talk with me. She's a cool person but i just get this weird feeling like something is off. I rarely text first and yet she still texts me. I reply very dry sometimes and she still texts me. I hate myself for getting annoyed by it because i used to be like this not long ago..

I don't know if i should give her a chance and ask her out or to completely cut all ties to not led her or disappoint her

Any advice?
