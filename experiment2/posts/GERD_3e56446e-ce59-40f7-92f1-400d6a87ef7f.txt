How soon do your triggers "hit" you?
I'm currently on day 5 of a relapse from hell. I'm down to eating overnight oats, plain chicken breast, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, and a few other very "safe" things (still experiencing mad symptoms despite this). 

 I'm having trouble identifying what's a trigger or not for me. For a few weeks there I was indulging in the occasional chocolate, fried food, and even coffee with no problems. Now it feels like everything is a trigger?

Just curious about your experience - how soon after eating something do you recognize it as a trigger?
