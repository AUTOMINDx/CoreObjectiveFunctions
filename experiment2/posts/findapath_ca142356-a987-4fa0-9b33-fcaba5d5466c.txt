What good careers focus on problem solving rather than knowledge?
Some background: I've turned 30 and wasted most of my life so far chasing wet dream in arts and humanities. That didn't pay off, but I transitioned to Software and been doing alright and enjoying it for the past year, however I'm lacking skills compared to other folks with IT background. I can solve problems and fix stuff easily, but it's rarely "best practice".

My main skill is problem solving, but not so fast learning anymore or people skills. How can I steer my career to make most of it?
