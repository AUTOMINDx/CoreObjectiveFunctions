Irrational Thoughts
so a while ago i was driving my best friend of 11 years back to her house, and she had told me to take a way that i was very unfamiliar with. it was pretty late at night and i think my anxiety kicked in. i began to think too much and next thing i knew i had convinced myself she was taking me somewhere to kill me and i genuinely could not hold conversation with her after that until we reached her house. i wanted to get home as soon as possible and it really tampered with my mood every other interaction i had with her afterwards. if it were anyone else it would make some sense, but sheâ€™s been my best friend since kindergarten. any advice?
