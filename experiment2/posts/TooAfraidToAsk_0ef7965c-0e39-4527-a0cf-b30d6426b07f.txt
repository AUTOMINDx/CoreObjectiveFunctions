Why does Richard Williams (father of Venus and Serena) get a significantly more favorable public portrayal than Earl Woods (Tiger's dad)?
Growing up, I feel like I never heard a kind word said about Earl Woods. They'd make jokes about him on SNL, pretending he'd glue a golf club into Tiger's hands and he was such a psycho parent and terrible husband.

Now I'm hearing a lot more about Richard Williams, who seems similar to Earl, but also worse in almost every way, and I don't understand why he's so much more respected and admired. 

He legit has no idea how many kids he has, one of his own kids guesses as many as 20. He admits to hiding his wife's birth control to get her pregnant. He went out of his way to put the kids in dangerous Compton because he thought it would make them tougher, which ultimately led to one of Venus &amp; Serena's sisters getting shot and killed. 

What am I missing?
