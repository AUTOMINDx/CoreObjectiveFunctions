In United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland PhD schools or post-doc positions, how much of a disadvantage is a diagnosis of PDD-NOS, ASD or asperger's (from perspective of requiring accomodations)
My thesis advisor is very understanding, and supportive of my occasional shutdowns/burnouts for undergrad/MSc studies in Hungary.

I hope to move to either Ireland or UK for PhD and later, and I worry that it'll be less survivable with my personal difficulties.

For someone who has such diagnoses (F84 and subtypes), either made late or in childhood, what were your experiences when it came to asking for accomodations, and how those accomodations affected your academic career?
