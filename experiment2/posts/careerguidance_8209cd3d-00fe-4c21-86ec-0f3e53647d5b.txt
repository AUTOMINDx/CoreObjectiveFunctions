Boss playing mind games with me?
I have had many issues at my new place of work, all dealing with my supervisor. I realized I have 2-3x the amount of work compared to people of my same position. This seems to be a norm, some assistants have normal work loads and then there are assistants like me. Other assistants in my position seem to be doing unpaid overtime which is actually breaking contract. My boss has recently expressed his displeasure in my work and continues to reiterate that maybe I’m not fit for this role (going to fire me) or maybe this isn’t what I thought it would be or maybe I’m not happy here (he wants me to quit). Today he said I’m not meeting expectations but in my 90 day review which just happened the other day, he wrote that I am meeting expectations. I am so sick of my boss but I have good benefits and pay. Do I just wait for them to fire me? Or quit ? (I am a 1099 so I don’t get unemployment, though I am treated like a regular employee) 

P.S. I have spoken to HR about this and they seem to care but nothing has been done yet
