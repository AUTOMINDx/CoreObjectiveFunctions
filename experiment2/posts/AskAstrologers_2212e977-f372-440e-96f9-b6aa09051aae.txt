Is this upcoming solar eclipse a good time to quit my unfulfilling job?
Hi all. I need to quit my current job for a multitude of reasons and had planned to do so this Friday, December 3rd. However, I just noticed that the date coincides with the total solar eclipse this week. 

Is there any reason I should put off handing in my resignation until after the solar eclipse? Could handing it in on Friday provoke an explosive reaction tied to the current planetary alignments? Or conversely, is it a good day to make a change to usher in new beginnings? Any guidance is welcome! 

I might need to quit on Friday regardless, so please let me know if there are positive aspects too! Thank you :)
