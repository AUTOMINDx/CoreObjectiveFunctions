My girlfriend’s behavior the last few days has been immature, how to bring up that her behavior was shitty
My girlfriend and I are in our mid 20’s and together almost 2 years. This weekend showed a side of her that made her look like an inconsiderate, immature teenager.

Item #1- we were invited to my parents’ for dinner. She knew but slept in and ended up eating at 3pm.

Item #2- after we got to my parents’ she stayed in the den while I went to help with dinner. I came to get her for dinner she said she wasn’t hungry because she had a late lunch and I can go eat without her. I literally had to drag her to the dinner table.

Item #3- my parents cooked. I did the dishes but she sat there and played on her phone. She usually helps but nope just sat at the table.

Item #4- this morning she was talking to me but hung up to go to the bathroom. After radio silence for 2.5h- I  called and she told me she got sidetracked and forgot to call back or tell me.

I already talked to her that we were guests at my parents’ and her isolating looks bad. I’ve also talked about not telling me she wasn’t gonna call back. I don’t think she understood cause I didn’t get a single apology.

I can’t believe I have to have this talk with a grown ass woman but how do I get the point across that the way she behaved was more or less how a fucking spoiled teenager behaves?


Tl;dr- girlfriend basically acted like a child. Doesn’t think she did anything wrong and already talked to her about some of these things. How can I tell her what she’s doing is immature?
