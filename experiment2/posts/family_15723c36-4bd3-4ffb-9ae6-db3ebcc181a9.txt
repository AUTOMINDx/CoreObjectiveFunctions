How to deal with a toxic sibling at college
Even just writing this I get mad. Long story short, unfortunately my sibling followed me to college (I’m a junior she’s a freshman). Ironically, she has a twin sister who also goes here. The thing that makes me mad is she tries to act cool around her friends whenever she passes me and it pisses me off. For example, I don’t have my license for various reasons, but one day I was driving a golf cart on campus for my job and pass here and her friends and she says “wow you don’t have your license but are driving that!” Like she always tries to make some comment like that, and honestly it really pisses me off. I feel like I’ve lost the respect of the people in her friend group now—and I’m an RA so it’s even worse. On top of that she’s emotionally unstable and sometimes tries to unload that on me. She’s honestly ruining my college experience. My other sister who goes here is awesome. She’s super fun to be around. Any tips on how to deal with this situation? And do you think I overreacted by getting mad about the license thing? She said it in front of a group of people.
