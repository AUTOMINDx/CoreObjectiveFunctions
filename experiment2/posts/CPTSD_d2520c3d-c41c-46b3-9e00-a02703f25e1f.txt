Self-Kindness
I’m so tired of being my own worst enemy. I hear from therapists all the time “You need to be more kind to yourself” or “You need to practice self kindness” but it’s so much easier said than done. Plus I don’t even know how you’re supposed to do that. The only example I’ve heard of is people telling themselves in a mirror that they love themselves or that they’re good enough but it doesn’t work for me. I still get flustered and beat myself up a lot.

I just want a clear answer on how to practice self-kindness 😪
