Do therapists believe virtual work is just as beneficial to the client over in person meetings?
It seems like this whole industry has gone virtual and it bums me out. I understand the circumstances of Covid-19 have played a big part, but I really suspect we won't see this change back. I mean, I get it. Who wouldn't prefer to work remotely (from home even), if possible, but from one client perspective, the idea of virtual therapy makes me extremely uncomfortable.

I've been looking for someone locally for awhile now, and I just can't find anything local that fits my needs. Even if I could, they all say only telehealth appointments now so I guess I don't have to search locally anymore. I have the best of intentions for wanting to go to therapy...which is to improve a relationship. But my fear is my uncomfortableness with virtual therapy will unintentionally undermine this process. 

I mean, I like to think of therapy as being very personal, and the inability to make eye contact with a therapist is the antithesis of that to me.
