Project Management Certifications worth it?
Is getting a PM certification worth it? If so, are there certain ones that hold more weight than others?

I work in environmental consulting, so ymmv, but a decent amount of the PM’s I work with have some sort of PM certification. I’ve about 7 years of experience and have started doing some deputy PM tasks, but really want to step forward into being a PM.
