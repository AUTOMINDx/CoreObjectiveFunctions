What are some rights and laws people in dating field or relationships know? (Posted this on r/women wanted to cross post but couldn't)
I will start first.. 
1. If you consented to sexual acts without being aware he was married. 
2. If the person wearing condom was why you consent to the act and then they proceeded to not wear it. 
3. If you consented to sex because of promises of marriage and cohabitation and the person had no intention to marry you. And that was THE reason you consented. 
4. Even lying about age,. You can sue the person for fraud in inducement. 
5. If they get you pregnant deceitfully. 
6. If they give you STDs deceitfully. You can sue them for emotional damages. 

You can also sue them for criminal breach of trust in a lot of conditions. But ofc it depends on the laws in your state and country

BECAUSE THE CONSENT YOU GIVE IS NOT INFORMED CONSENT
