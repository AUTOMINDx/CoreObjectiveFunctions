Issues with back, need it to heal fast.
Basically I (M22) hurt my back when moving heavy boxes down awkward stairs all day when moving. I don't exercise much, never smoked or done drugs only drank like 5 times in my life. Usually if something like this happens Ill just ignore the pain and leave it till it stops in a few months. Issue is I cant sleep cause it is just painful enough to wake me every 30 min to an hour and I need to be doing a lot of heavy and constant lifting soon and currently it hurts in most positions and under load however the actual weight itself isn't a factor.   


I believe its a torn muscle between ribs/spine area and shoulder blade as it keeps cramping if I keep it still in a angle that doesn't hurt. I cant rotate my arm back without a lot of aching and pain and cant move it upwards either. I have 2 weeks maximum to get it healed but I don't know what I can do to help it. My hands cant reach it and would rather avoid using ice packs due to a circulatory disorder.  


Any advice would be appreciated as I really don't have the time to let it heal slowly and don't need to add another permanent issue to the list. Apologies if this isn't what this subreddit is first, only thing I found online is Ice packs.
