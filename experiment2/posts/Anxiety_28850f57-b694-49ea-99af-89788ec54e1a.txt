Don’t invalidate yourself and your symptoms
A lot of us deal with anxiety and it’s symptoms in a very physical way, and we subconsciously numb ourselves to the physical feelings. A baffling amount of us have gone to the ER over having physical symptoms, and after being told you have anxiety over and over, despite it supposed to being reassuring that nothing is wrong, it can make you feel invalidated. 

I was feeling sick, and it wasn’t very different than the everyday sick my anxiety causes, but I had a legitimate infection caused by an abscessed wisdom tooth, which can be very dangerous. It didn’t bother me pain wise, but I assumed it was just my anxiety portraying itself physically like it normally does.

My point is that, yes anxiety can cause legitimate and very real physical problems, but you shouldn’t always ignore them either, it can be difficult to find a balance. Your doctors are not tired of seeing you, the ER would rather you come in and nothing be wrong than you have something wrong and not have gone. 

Go to the dentist!
