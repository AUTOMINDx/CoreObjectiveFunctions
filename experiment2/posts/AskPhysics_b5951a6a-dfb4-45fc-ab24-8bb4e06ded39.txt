Which unit is equivalent to meters per second?
I’m pretty sure that the key for my homework is wrong, since the question asks which answer choice is equal to meters per second. I think that it is Hz(m), since Hz is pretty much 1/s. multiply that by m/1 and you get m/s. However, the answer marked as correct is m/Hz… am I doing something wrong or is the key wrong??
