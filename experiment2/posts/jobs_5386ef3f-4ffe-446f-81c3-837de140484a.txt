Interviewer says they'll get back to me within 30 days =/..
Recently had a great interview two weeks ago for a role I really want. 

Felt informal, more like a conversation. I got along well with the supervisor and answered well.

I asked at the end when should I hear back, he said within 30 days...

My anxiety is sky high lol.
