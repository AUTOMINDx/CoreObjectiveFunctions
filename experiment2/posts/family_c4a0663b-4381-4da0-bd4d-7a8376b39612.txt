Advice?: I’m cutting off my brother permanently
LONG STORY: Maybe looking for some light advice from those who have gone through this with a sibling. I’ve made my decision but need to vent this. I have a therapist that I’ll talk to next week about this but I just had a falling out with my brother and want to post while this is all fresh. 

Background: I (31F) have an older sibling, Brother (33M) that I’ve tried really hard to help and get along with all of our lives. It’s never been easy. Brother is diagnosed bipolar, manic depressive, has very disruptive OCD and severe anger problems. He has always had these since we were kids and it’s resulted in violence, mild assault, problems between family members, cost him jobs, etc. He tried before but now refuses medication and counseling. We are each other’s only sibling, have the same parents, both of whom are still alive and have been divorced since I was 3 but get along decently. I have helped Brother numerous times in the past to get on his feet, help him get to work, letting him borrow cars, given him money, food, I even paid for furniture to furnish a room he was renting from a mutual friend which ended badly and did not ask for him to pay me back ever. he either sold/threw away the furniture. I’ve given him any help I can. A year ago I convinced our mother to let him borrow her car during winter (she can’t drive anymore) so Brother wouldn’t have to ride a bike to work in freezing weather at night. she still pays the insurance and my husband fixes the car when Brother damages it or it needs tune up, which husband does out of love for me, not because he likes Brother. 

However, this year I began to distance myself from him because I am finally reaching my tolerance limit of his manipulation, anger, abuse, selfishness, and because the last straw was when I had to put my first, most important and beloved 12 year old dog to sleep unexpectedly, and he used her as an excuse to come to my house to bitch about how awful his life and job is, for 4 hours and then wouldn’t leave so I could spend the last remaining hours with the most important friend I ever had in my life. He literally only cares about himself. Our relationship now is (or was until today) cordial but I have kept him at arm’s length. I don’t invite him to my house for social calls anymore, I don’t meet him solo, and any phone communication is brief. Tbh I maintain this relationship solely to avoid upsetting our parents who still desperately want to see him even though he is also abusive to them. I don’t blame them at all for this; he is their son and they love him unconditionally. I would never ask them to cut him out of their lives no matter how much I dislike him and I would never prevent them from seeing him. I would not want him to suffer in any way but I’ve drawn my boundary for my and my husband’s own mental health. 

Context so that you understand how dependent my parents are, and how my decision will affect them: Due to numerous health issues, two years ago I moved our mom to my town and 10 months ago I moved our dad to my town with absolutely no help from Brother both times even though he also already lives in the same town. I am a part time caretaker for both of our parents with no help from Brother. He sees our dad once a few times a month and brings him beer/cigs/pizza (dad pays for his own cigs and beer) but can’t be bothered to help with the smallest thing like take dads trash to the dumpster across the parking lot (Dad uses walker and has fallen trying to do it himself). Brother visits mom a few times a month but it’s usually to use her washer and dryer to avoid paying for a laundromat, eat her food, and to watch Netflix on her big TV. More often than not the visits ends poorly due to brothers temper. I am responsible for making sure some of my parent’s bills are paid (paid partially with their money and partially with my money,  and my moms younger brother takes care of some of her bills too), take them to all of their doctor appointments, I visit each of them once a week to help with chores, shopping for food, clothes, taking pets to the vet, other life/care tasks as needed, and some outings/entertainment as my schedule allows. I’m married, no kids, work full time, and have several pets of my own. My parents are both physically disabled, walk with walkers or wheelchairs, mom is on oxygen, and they are not able to take themselves anywhere on their own. This makes them very dependent on me for help and I’m glad to do it. This also means they don’t get out of the house as much as others so friends and family must come to them. 

So here is the last situation which made me finalize my decision to cut him off: my mother in law (MIL) hosted thanksgiving yesterday in her home and for the first time in many years my whole immediate family has been together for thanksgiving. We had my parents, my brother, my husband, my MIL, and my husbands best friend over for the day for festivities. Everything was going well until right about 30 min before everyone was about to leave, and during a FaceTime call with some other relatives, we hear Brother yelling from the living room at one of my MIL’s dogs “I will f**k you up” and “I will f**king kill you”. I scolded Brother briefly for yelling while I was on the phone, and he gathered his belongings quickly/angrily, and sat in the car until we finished our call and I walked our dad out because Brother was supposed to drive dad home. I apologized to Brother directly for scolding him and I thanked him for taking dad home, but Brother would not speak or look at me. Today, after speaking to my husband about what husband saw/heard/Brother told him directly while I was on the phone, I learn that the dog either snapped or growled at Brother while Brother was “petting” him. The dog had a leg surgery almost 10 years ago after getting hit by a car and does not like to be touched on his legs or tail, but has never bitten any of us or any strangers unless we try to invade his space, cuddle him, or pick him up. Brother very much loves dogs and cats but is not respectful of dogs at all and has a tendency to immediately invade an unfamiliar dogs space trying to pet or cuddle. I realize he unintentionally may have hurt the dog or made it uncomfortable, but it was likely due to incorrect interaction and he immediately got angry and threatened violence on my MILs dog when it reacted in my MILs house. As a multiple dog parent myself, I sent a very direct message to Brother today about how brother’s actions could get him very hurt, how I observed other dangerous actions he made with the other dogs (MIL has 3 and I caught Brother trying to lay in a dog bed with one of them, whom he had never met previously), and how it’s never ok to threaten harm to someone else’s dog in their own home.  His response to my message was “F**k yourself c**t.” Another bit of info: 2019 during Christmas at MIL’s, Brother got angry with a different dog almost accidentally bit him while he was trying to hand feed her (we all knew not to hand feed her but unfortunately didn’t think to tell him). He was insanely disrespectful to my MIL for the rest of the day (taking out his anger on her) and it pissed me off very much because she is a lovely, wonderful woman who is one of my closest friends and has been nothing but absolute gold to my entire family, even going so far as to offering to house both my parents personally in her home for free. I almost didn’t invite Brother this year but knew the disappointment from my parents would prevent them from joining for holidays so I made sure to ask my dad to ensure Brother understood he needed to behave especially after what happened in 2019. 

So looks like Brother won’t be talking to me for a while but it’s just as well since I honestly want nothing to do with him and I don’t even think I love him as family anymore. My MIL is afraid of him and my husband, who is incredibly tolerant to a fault, is wondering if Brother is safe to be around. 

Has anyone had to cut off a sibling like this and what was your parents reaction? My parents will never ever cut him out and honestly seem to grovel for his forgiveness when something goes wrong so that he will visit them again. I dont think it’s right for my parents to expect everyone to continually tolerate Brother when he is abusive and potentially violent. I have made my decision and am going to tell my parents that I no longer will extend Brother an invitation to any holidays that I host and that I, my husband, and my MIL will not attend any event that Brother will be present at. I anticipate that this will make it difficult for my parents to have holidays with him since they can’t get around on their own but I’m no longer willing to sacrifice things in my life or relationships to cater to Brother. 

TLDR: my brother will be the only person not welcome to future holiday celebrations I have with my family and I will be permanently going no contact with him due to his own repeated actions. Has anyone also had to do this to a sibling and how did you break it to parents/how did they react? TIA
