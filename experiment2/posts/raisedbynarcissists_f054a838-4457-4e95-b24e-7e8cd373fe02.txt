Tis the season to be obligated and annoyed
My parents have been divorced for 37 years. I'm my mom's only child and my dad had another kid in his second marriage. My parents live 4 hours apart, so I alternate holidays. But recently my mom told me that it's not fair for me to alternate because my dad has his son, so she should get me. It was striking to me that my role in that scenario was solely to balance the scales between my parents and not to be a person--and a parent--who might want to balance time with my parents.
