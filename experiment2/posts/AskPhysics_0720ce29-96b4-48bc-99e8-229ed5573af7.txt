I don't understand physics for the life of me
I am taking electricity and magnetism for physics right now and finals are next week and I am barely passing. Every test/quiz we do, everything is just confusing to me. I watch so many videos and try to practice problems but my mind is blank. I can't understand the concept or understand what is even going on in the first place. I need to pass this class and fluids later on before I transfer for Fall 2022 to a 4 year and I am stressing myself out. Any tips on how any of you got out of this for those of you who have struggled really badly in physics.
