2nd date - what should I do/expect?
Hello,

I've met a woman last week-end through online, we spent 6 hours together and I think that we could have been together longer. First time in a while that I feel a sort of chemistry with a woman. We didn't kiss but she told me that I can hug her at the very end of the date.

Now, we have planed to meet this week-end for an activity (ice-skating) and I was wondering what should I do during this date? I'm a bit afraid because I've never kissed a girl before and she is older than me.

UPDATE: She blocked me last Saturday, I was confused and sent her stupid messages/voicemail, now she keeps blocking and unblocking me. I'm not playing games. I've blocked her.
