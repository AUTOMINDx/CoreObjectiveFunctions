Is it possible to create visible light beams for my art project?
I’m a high school student who’s pretty bad at physics, but I have to make an artistic object for school where light plays a positive rol. I was thinking about painting a box black, and placing mirrors around it with a light source. That light source will ‘shine’ towards one mirror, which will shine towards the other, and all the light beams should eventually create a star. I first doubted if this was even possible, since light sources usually shine all over the place, and don’t have visible light beams. I talked to a physics teacher about it and he gave me a very strong projector with different lenses to work with. What do you think? Could it be possible to create visible light beams that will make a star shape?
