WTF! She tells me “I’m not a very good girlfriend, you deserve better” but never changes the routine or improves.
Basically when I bring up an issue like reciprocation, this is what I’m told.  

In my head, the ball is in her court and it’s her move to show me she cares, listens and wants me, but I haven’t seen much to my satisfaction after multiple conversations of our needs in the relationship. 

Is it over?
