[29M] Went on a date with someone who was about 40 lbs heavier than their pics...
IDK if this is more venting or if I am looking for advice or what, but I am typically very superficial and I will admit that and probably going to get flamed...

Please don't flame me.... just a superficial man here that keeps up with his health and is important to me to be with someone who does as well for looks and just plain self respect for themselves. (I have flaws too that make me strive for this in a partner due to lack of self confidence on my end)

Side/funny note: She asked if I was a catfish before our first date and complained about someone catfishing her who was 70lbs heavier than their pics so I know she is fully aware of how she is probably being perceived by me as she is doing the same thing...

Before and after our date our convos have been great and we share similar interests. It seems to me she has always been fit and active, but COVID made things get away from her.

I want to continue to see her, but currently do not feel very attracted to her physically. She is active and keeps up with the gym so I see her getting back to being healthy and whatnot. 

Do I take it at face value right now in the moment and this is not someone I would want to spend my life with and end it now? Or do I enjoy getting to know her and hope she gets herself back into a healthier spot? 

I like her personality and want to continue seeing her, but we have already talked about being sexually active and I do not want to let her down in the near future because I do not feel that way right now.

Us men are barbaric and simple minded when it comes to attraction, but for women can physical attraction grow immensely from about nothing?

Would the attraction come, or would it always be less because of first impressions?
