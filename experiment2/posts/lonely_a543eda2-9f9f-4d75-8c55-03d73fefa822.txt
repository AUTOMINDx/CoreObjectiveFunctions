Trying not to cry on my birthday.
Today is my birthday (Nov. 28). I just attempted last night, didn't get the job done. I'm really trying not to cry now cause my mom's here. Existential crisis, depression, anxiety and PTSD hits hard. 

Listening to music, taking care of my dogs and doing my artworks are the only thing that makes me alive today.
