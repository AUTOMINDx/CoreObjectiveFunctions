Not sure if herpes or something else. Looking to become more educated.
M24, had unprotected vaginal sex 20 days ago, gave her oral, didn’t receive oral. I noticed the spots in the pictures about 3-4 days ago, but that was also right after I shaved. I typically shave dry and am not always super vigilant about going with the grain, I cut myself pretty regularly when I shave and am pretty sure I did this last time(feel free to roast me for anything in that sentence, I know I’m an idiot lol). Also jacked off using a different type of lotion last week because I am away from home and only have a face moisturizer lotion, not sure if that would be a factor. The spots are not painful at all, and I haven’t really noticed any of the other common symptoms; no major fatigue, no fever, no major noticeable burning sensation when peeing, have had an occasional headache but I also started wellbutrin 3 weeks ago, and haven’t been wearing my glasses lately so am assuming the headaches are more likely associated with those factors. 

Went and got tested for a full panel with bloodwork today so should have those results in the next couple days, but am just looking for some additional opinions in the meantime to become more educated on what this might be.
