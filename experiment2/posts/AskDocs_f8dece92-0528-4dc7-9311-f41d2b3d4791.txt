Male : age 17, I have a lead paint ceiling in my kitchen that is flaking. Is this a threat to my health?
Im still a teenager and my parents doesn't worry about these type of things... So they wouldn't repaint the ceiling. It's unfortunate but I guess I'll just have to deal with it, the least I could to is make my self stop worrying. I'm just concerned on whether if the flaking paint and its dust (if any dust would be formed by flaking paint), would land on my food or be in the air I breathe. Would that have any effect on my health?

Side note: my house is built in 1965, not sure if that provides any helpful info...
