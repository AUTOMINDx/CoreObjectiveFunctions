Why don't I want to do anything?
For context, I'm a second-year college student and I've been stuck at home since May because of the pandemic.   
I've been incredibly unproductive for most of that time. All my lectures are online so I just record them and never touch them again. My assignments keeps piling up, and I only do them half-heartedly just before the deadline. I go to bed late (around 2AM) and wake up at like 9 or 10 AM, not feeling rested at all. I spend most of my time playing with my phone, watching youtube, sleeping, or just reading random things on the Internet.   
I feel like I don't have the energy or motivation to do anything. I aspire to be an artist (which is kinda related to my major), I have registered for an Illustration course but then quit because I didn't have the fundamentals.   
I don't know what's wrong with me anymore. Is it because of the pandemic, or is it just because I'm lazy. I clearly have time for personal development and to study, but all I do is doing nothing all day.   
How do I end this destructive lifestyle?
