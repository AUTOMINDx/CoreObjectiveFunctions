16, feeling lonely and suicidal thoughts
(sorry for bad English)

Hey guys, i just don’t like the feeling of being lonely everyday and it push me to suicide thoughts sometimes, everytime I go home after school or the whole weekend I got nothing to do and feeling very lonely, nobody invites me, I even got a job on the weekends and I’m still feeling very empty inside of me. I still haven’t got a gf cuz I’m not very good looking, I full work on myself this year, lost 70lbs, got a fresh haircut,new clothing,skin care routine, everything good. I got very good friends and laughing with them and stuff. But inside im not happy at all. Every time I see people at my age and even below my age in a relationship it makes me disgusted,sad,lonely or something idk. I’ve been in 3 talking stages this year and all of those girls left me. Left me for her ex, left me for boy bestfriend and friendzoned… and Now? I don’t know what to do, I have suicidal thoughts cuz I’m feeling alone, not happy, feeling empty, I’ve never got the feeling of being loved or affection in my whole life.
