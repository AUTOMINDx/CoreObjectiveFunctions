How has your childhood around a narcissist affect your love life?
If it has at all.

I entered my late 20s and I’ve been single all my life. It feels like I built defensive mechanisms for myself after how my Ndad has made me feel, and they stop me from allowing myself to experience love. 

I’ve had girls interested in me but I run away from commitment, I don’t let anyone I’m into get to truly know me, I keep everything to myself, I’m worried about every word I say, every gesture I make, I’m terrified of rejection yet affection makes me uncomfortable, it’s like I think I don’t deserve it, etc. Everything about romance stresses me out. I’m doomed.

I’m not really looking for advice because I realize therapy seems to be the only option for me at this point, but I can’t afford it at the moment so I’d just like to know if your trauma also affected your love life this way?
