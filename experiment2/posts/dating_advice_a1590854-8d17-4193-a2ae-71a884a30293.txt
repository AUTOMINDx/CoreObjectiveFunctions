I really don’t get it
I (32F) matched with a guy (28M) last friday. We really hit if off during chatting. I was getting over another bad dating experience and I told him I would like to take things slow. He said he understood and will be patient enough with me until I am comfortable to go out with him. I felt it was strange that some guy would genuinely be so interested in me from day 1 of texting. He said he would love to have serious relationship with me in future. I asked for his IG, we chatted almost everyday without huge time gaps. We planned for a place to meet but did not fix a date. It was thanksgiving and since he said he would be busy with his family, I was waiting for him to get Free so I can schedule something. I am not sure what went wrong but he has stopped responding to my texts. He left me on read on IG texts. I can see him uploading stories but not responding to me. I waited for 3 days and sent him a text saying if he was busy or wasn’t interested anymore and he can openly tell me about it. The message is on sent with no last seen status. Looks like he restricted me on IG and also hid me from viewing his stories, which he uploaded 1 hour after I texted him. I really don’t understand what went wrong, I re-read my texts and my last texts were just regular good morning text, how I was planning to work on thanksgiving since I don’t celebrate it and don’t have my family in the US and that’s about it. It hurts when people ghost all of a sudden, I guess I will just give up on online dating. Sorry I just wanted to vent. It just hurts a lot. I  invest my time in only one person at a time, when I feel like there’s a possibility of connection. I really don’t know who to trust anymore. I will now need time to move on from this. It just messes up my entire world. I will be alright but I just don’t like this phase. 
Sorry and thanks again for reading.
