How to Put in my Notice
Im currently in the midst of a 2 year contract that I want out of. It requires 45 days notice according to the contract. I've lined up a new position, which begins in February.  How does one put in their notice? Do I just print out a document and sign it that says "This is my 45 days notice. My date of resignation is _____" and have it be 45 days in the future? Do I hand it to my supervisor or to HR or both?  Then just keep showing up and doing my job until that date? Is that it?
