Should hunting be allowed?
Hunting is the single best generator of conservation funds in the country. Full stop. Bullets, guns, tags, stamps, fees, taxes, and licenses generate a boatload of money for conservation.

It is one of only two options to control wildlife populations. 1. Government hunters. These guys are paid by the gov to cull animals. (An expense) Or 2. Public hunting. Where someone pays to be able to hunt and gets to take the meat. (A revenue)

I see many liberals these days (although less over the past several years) say that hunting is terrible and abusive to animals. I’d say killing an animal inhumanly (like stoning a deer or something) is wrong, but shooting a deer kills it quickly. We have plenty of laws on the books to create fair chase and to humanely kill to prevent that. I mention this because it’s a Red herring since we already prevent this issue.

So the question is, if we have a renewable resource (the animal) that we can sustainably harvest, that does not harm the ecosystem in the short or long term, should we be able to hunt it?



Bonus if you can also answer if states should be able to ban hunts on certain animals just because they want to even tho it’s renewable, sustainable, doesn’t harm etc.

If you like this topic, I encourage you to look into the North American model of wildlife management. It is widely regarded as the best system in the world and is deeply intertwined with American beliefs.

Edit: and also, if you are a yes, why are some on the left a No?
