Recommendations for texts on nonhuman/animal experiences?
Hi! I'm very interested in animal ethics, particularly so regarding the nonhuman perspective. Research has unearthed a lot about cognition in animals in recent years, and I'm wondering whether you are familiar with any philosophers who take this into account?

In my opinion, some discourse about animals seems to exclude the complex experiences of individuals of various species, so it'd be interesting to read about more knowledgeable reflections on this.
