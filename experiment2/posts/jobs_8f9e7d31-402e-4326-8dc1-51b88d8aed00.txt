Would you pick a boring career for the financial rewards it offers your family?
**Would you work in a field you are good at but are bored to tears for a good life outside of the office for you and your family?**

In the old days, most people had terrible jobs they were boring, physically challenging, dangerous for life. They did not like it but that was expected. You had to work if you wanted to support your wife and large family. An awful job was just part of life and you made the best of it.

Now people seem to think they are entitled to a sexy well-paid job without paying their dues. They feel entitled to a great career with a handsome salary without putting in the work into training and paying their dues.

My best friend- the CPA- Accountant is more old-fashioned in his approach. He thinks being an Accountant is extremely dull and does not enjoy his workdays. He survives it and tries to find joy in the intellectual nature of his work and some nice coworkers. He never thought it would be fun, it is work.

But he has been very successful in his career and he is always fielding calls from headhunters wanting him to move to a new company for an even more handsome salary. He is so marketable that he can move to any city in America and get a good job. And the money he is earning provides his family with a really good life. Great house, meals out, material goods, 5-star vacations, and experiences.
