When I was applying to colleges, my secret #1 criterion was how far away that college would get me from my mother. It's why I didn't apply to a single college in my state.
When I began struggling at college due to the numerous untreated mental health issues she either ignored or caused, I made *and acted on* the decision that I would literally rather kill myself than move back in with her.

Yet it wasn't until 28 years old that it finally occurred to me that maybe she was just a bad mother, and I wasn't a bad person for being unable to love her.

Funny what trauma does to the brain.
