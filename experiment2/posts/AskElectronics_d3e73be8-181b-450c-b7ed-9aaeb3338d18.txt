Project electric engineering - PWM signal to voltage converter
Hi everyone,

I study Electric engineering and for my next school project I'll have to make a PWM signal to Voltage Converter Circuit on a PCB. The goal of this project is to manage rectifiers with a higher current.

Because the max current on one of the device that we are using (MiniTrans Plus) is 30A. And they want to send the PWM output of the MiniTrans Plus (0-10V) for example 100A to the rectifier.

So I wanted to ask for as many help and tips I could get before I start with the process of this project. Thanks in advance.
