Feeling a little bummed out lately
I have finally moved out on my own, I have a good job and a wonderful girlfriend beside me. I feel like I have nothing to complain about yet I cannot say I feel "adequate" to the situation. 

I feel tired most of the time (don't know if I can partially blame the season here, I hate dark and cold), but life feels more like a slow slow grind one step to the other. The days are jam packed , I feel like I have no time to spare. Even seeing friends is getting complicated. Somehow everytime I try addressing and resolving the random issue of the moment 2 or 3 other things magically pop out of thin air requiring attention and resources. 

It's probably a fantasy but I had always imagined this moment like one of absolute bliss and I feel a little like a fool.

I probably just expected it to be easier.
