Were Japanese civilians in WWII imprisoned, executed, etc. if they spoke out against the government the same way Soviet or German citizens were if they spoke out against their government?

Did Japan have a domestic secret police like the Gestapo or KGB? What was life like for the average Japanese citizen at the time?
