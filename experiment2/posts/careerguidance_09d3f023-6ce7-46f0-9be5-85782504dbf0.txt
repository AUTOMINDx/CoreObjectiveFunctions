Interview follow-up question: when to send?
I had one interview with 4 hiring managers, which went well. 2 days later, HR reached out to set up an interview with the managers' boss the following week, which was last Tuesday. It went okay, I think, and lasted the full 30 minute block they allotted.

Based on our conversation, I know last wednesday was a half day, thanksgiving was a holiday, and they were closed the next day, too. Today is 1 week out and I have not heard from anyone, but given the holiday, I don't really think I should count the latter half of last week.

Thoughts on when to reach out for any follow-up, if at all?
