I want to be loved.
Turning 30 soon and I'm in no position to complain about life in general. Nice job, stable economy, a good rental apartment. But all those things don't really make me happy. I haven't been happy for real since 2017. Years ago I used to have a girl who I thought was my soulmate. I loved her above all else, even life itself. She was my best friend and the only person to truly understand me. I let her get away and now she's somebody elses soulmate. Since then I have isolated myself when I'm not at work.. lost all my friends save for one. So I just work instead. When I don't work I drink. I'm sick of both.

I'm not a people person. I can't wrap my head around the dating game. Dating is like being a used car salesman only you're the car. And I'm a beat up old rusty car that rarely starts. At least in my head. I don't believe in myself for a second. I'm like Midas only everything I touch turns into shit. 

I'm so fucking scared of never feeling the same way about a person like I did. Of getting too old to start a family. Of never being loved the same way back. Of never being understood the same way. Of never having a happy soul again. But I'm also too scared of opening up, scared to be left again when they see me for who I am. It's a catch 22 of crap.

Outside of work I've got nothing to live for. Sometimes I fantasize about swerving off the road on my way home from work, make it look like an accident. I got really drunk once on a friday and overdosed on sleeping pills. Woke up sunday night. 

Can't believe I'm turning 30 already. Not that anyone will remember since I pushed everyone away. Feels like I turned 20 yesterday. 

Don't expect anyone on here to read or reply to my drivel. Just wanted to put it into words on a screen.

I just want to be loved. By me. So that I can be loved by someone else.
