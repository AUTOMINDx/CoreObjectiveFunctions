This one is tough. What's a good job or career path for someone with limited English?
I'm trying to find a job for my SO but it's tough because he has limited English with only a high school education. I think it'd be best for him to get a certificate but I have no idea what would be a good fit for him. He's 29 and we are in the Tampa area if that matters. I don't think he will be able to find a good job without some type of certification, which is why I'm asking for help. Anyone have suggestions? 

Thank you!
