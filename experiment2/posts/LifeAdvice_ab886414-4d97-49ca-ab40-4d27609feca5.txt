Any advice can I find out what I’m supposed to do with my life?
I’m 28 and I have no idea what I’m supposed to be doing with myself. I’ve been working in retail for the last 4 years, I started with this company almost a year after I received my bachelors degree and I want to do something different but I don’t know what. I feel like a total failure and I don’t know how to find what I’m good at or what I’m supposed to be doing with my life. I’m almost 30 and I have no life path. 

Also, I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about 2.5 years and we just moved together. He’s told me time and time again that I need to focus on myself and not so much on him or our relationship, which is/has been the biggest part of my life and getting the most of my attention since we’ve been together. I’ve been doing my best to make us work (we used to be long distance) because this relationship is something that I know I want. But other than that, I have no clue. And that worries me a lot. I don’t know how to focus on myself or make myself a priority. (I’m even starting to think that I may be lacking self love in some way and that Im seeking validation from others in order to see value in myself). 
 
I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this, and I can’t afford therapy. So I came here. 

I feel like I’m supposed to have my life or at least a path figured out by now, but I don’t think I’m even close. Does anyone have any advice or stories to share if they went through a similar situation?
