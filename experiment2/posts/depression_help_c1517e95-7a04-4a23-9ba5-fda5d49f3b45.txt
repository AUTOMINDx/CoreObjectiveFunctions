Help: Friend "Not in a great place" I don't know what to do
So I previously posted here about my ex who I'm concerned for. She was exceptionally quiet after she broke things off after her depression worsened and she felt she couldn't give what was needed to a relationship but still wanted to hang out and be friends. After a little while she got quiet (messages left unread) and I thought she was ghosting me at first but we messaged a little bit. Another week or so passed and she quietened up again so I asked her if I was annoying her and where we stood (stupid I know). 

She told me that she isn't in a great place right now and would appreciate it if I toned things down a bit. The problem is I don't know exactly what "not a great place" means and what I can do in the capacity of a friend. The only way I can think of toning things down is to take a step back and not message her but I don't want to just leave her to suffer alone.

Thanks to the marvels of apps like messenger and Snapchat I can see when she's been online (because who needs privacy right?) so I know she's at least still alive but I'm worried for her. I feel like I'm going mad worrying about the possibilities, whether she's ok or seeing someone else or fed up with me. Honestly I'd rather just be told she wasn't happy and didn't want to see or speak to me if that was the case. At the moment I feel like I'm in limbo but I don't just want to walk away. I'm fine if she doesn't love me, I just want her to be happy and healthy. I just miss my friend and the woman I fell in love with.

My question is, aside from the obvious what should I do when my friend says she isn't in a great place? Should I take a step back and wait for her to speak to me or what? I'd appreciate any advice.
