When I'll move out, my parents want to move in the same neighbourhood as me.
FUCK NO FUCK NO FUCK NO FUCK NO

I AM ***NOT*** PAYING A TWENTY YEAR MORTGAGE TO LIVE WITH THEM AGAIN.

They spent half of my life yelling me they can't stand seeing me, they still keep telling me we aren't "compatible enough to live in the same house", and despite all of this, in that period of time they fantasized about moving out in another city with me, and told me about it.

WOOO TURNS OUT THEY STILL WANT TO MOVE OUT TOGETHER WITH ME!!! What about FUCKING NOOOOOOOO

They brought it up and immediately told me they plan to move out close to me.

It's a common thing here, my family is scattered across the world but half the time people and their kids grow old with their grandparents.

A nice cute thing that my parents don't want to live without. They still don't understand I dont WANT this type of thing. IDONTWANTITIDONTWANTITIDONTWANTITIDONTWANTITIDONTWANTITIDONTWANTITIDONTWANTITIDONTWANTIT I!!! DON'T!!! WANT!!! IT!!!

I told them no, straight up. Just no, that I wanted to live alone. But they looked at me weird and didn't really answer. They gave me one of those "I'll nod to agree just to make you shut tf up" answers. You guys know what I'm talking about. I even repeated it a couple of times, that NO, they can't move close to me, and I didn't receive an actual answer.

Luckily enough they don't know I have a job and that I am planning to move out, to them I'm currently just a high school dropout.

But it'll be impossible in the future to hide the fact that I'm not living with them anymore if I move on the other side of the country.

I didn't want to hide where I'm going to live from them, but unfortunately I will have to.

I don't know how I'll manage it. All of my friends there have no idea about my life history, and they will surely receive a call from my parents.

How do I even explain this shit to people? Everyone just sees them as considerate parents, not as control freaks. I don't even want to talk about my parents again after moving out. UGH.

If they move close to me, I'll fucking change continent and stop talking to everyone I ever knew from my home country.

WHY CAN'T THEY JUST LEAVE ME ALONE???
