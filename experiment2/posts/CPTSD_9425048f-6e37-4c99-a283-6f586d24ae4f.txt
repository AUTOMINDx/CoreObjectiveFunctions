DAE feel the need and/or desire to dedicate their life to someone?
Personally, it's either because of my isolated, dictatorial childhood, or I should have been born a knight in the 18th century (lol). Not @ me daydreaming of a prince to serve, not to marry, as a child lolol.

If it's really because of my past, I  need to get a therapist asap cuz I feel like a lost puppy finding his owner, hopeless and miserable :|||
