Post Microsoft Interview anxiety
I recently interviewed for a Customer Engineer position with Microsoft the week before Thanksgiving. This was a 3x45min interview process and from my POV it went pretty well. The conversations were natural and fluid. A-couple times they even provided positive feedback on my responses. Anyways…it’s been a couple weeks now, I reached out to the recruiter last week and still haven’t heard back. Does anybody know the typical timeline for Microsoft hiring process? 

I’m going over my interview process in my head constantly thinking about what I may have said wrong or answered incorrectly. 


Any insight is appreciated.
