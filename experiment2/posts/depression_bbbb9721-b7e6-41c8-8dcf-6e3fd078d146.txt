Today I realised my depression and low self esteem is brought on by having super high expectations/standards that I place on myself.
There are areas in my life that I am failing in. I feel defeated by things that I cannot achieve. I'm constantly putting 110% effort into everything I do and when it doesn't go to plan I fall to absolute pieces. I get burned out, emotions run high, and my motivation dwindles.

It's just something I learned about myself today. I tried something, I failed, and now I feel really defeated. To anyone who has felt like this, what did you do to address this problem?
