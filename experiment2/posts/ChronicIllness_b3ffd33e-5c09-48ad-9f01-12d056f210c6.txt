Ketamine infusions vs Lyrica for neuropathic pain
So I’ve been dealing with chronic pelvic pain/pudendal neuralgia and basically what it feels like is that the nerves are always “on” and are very hyperexcitable.  Any activity that involves their “use” - sex/masturbation, peeing, pooping, certain exercises and sitting positions - causes mild to moderate pain for an extended period of time.  There is also this near incessant feeling of restlessness/pressure down there that isn’t pain, but is profoundly annoying.  Given all of this, there is sexual dysfunction as well, which is a problem in and of itself.

I’ve tried several things with virtually no help.  I tried pelvic floor therapy, but my muscles are completely fine, suggesting this is purely a nervous system issue.  Kratom doesn’t help, advil doesn’t help, weed makes it worse.  

But gabapentinoids help a TON.  I just don’t want to have to be on Lyrica for the rest of my life.  I want something a bit more sustainable that won’t be addicting and cause cognitive impairment.  I also have depression, which ketamine obviously can help immensely.

Has anyone who’s had pain relief from gabapentinoids found relief with ketamine as well?
