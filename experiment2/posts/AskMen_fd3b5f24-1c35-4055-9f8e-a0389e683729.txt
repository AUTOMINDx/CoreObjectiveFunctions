What to do with thought of death looming over after string of loved ones passing?
It’s been a few rough years 3 years of constant family and friends dying and it’s been getting a little rough and I would think this feeling would go away but it’s not. I celebrate and live life every day but some constant fear looms over. I feel like it’s something I don’t get to talk about with others, and pretend it’s normal(it is). What do we do with this feeling? How do you live a productive life with it? Tips and tricks accepted and welcome ❤️
