Newly Diagnosed 3 Weeks Ago
TW: child abuse

Hi everyone
I’m 23F. I had an abusive childhood. I just got diagnosed with PTSD through an intake evaluation by a professional psychiatrist. I don’t have nightmares nor do I react to loud stimuli like fireworks or stuff. But I block a lot of stuff out, dissociate, have frequent panic attacks where I just kinda freeze up, and I am overly jumpy to being scared as a somatic response. 

I don’t know much about PTSD other than what I’ve read but I saw a few resources here. 

What can I expect moving forward? How to better cope with it? Or even just better understanding it? I think my triggers in general are feeling abandoned and social anxiety like being around too many people or worrying what people think of me. Could these be related to PTSD? My friend suggested EMDR as a treatment which I have very little knowledge about. I also have Unspecified Personality Disorder, ADHD, GAD, and MDD. The psychiatrist also recommended other forms of medication but I’m a little reluctant to try because I’m already on adderall and Prozac, and I just got hydroxyzine. 

TLDR: Had a traumatic childhood, barely got diagnosed with PTSD and idk how to move forward with this diagnosis.
