Is there a responsibility for accountability if you are not the offender?
I’m wondering if people have a moral compunction to hold themselves accountable for offenses they did not themselves commit. For example, if someone’s father commits a crime, do they have a responsibility to apologize to the victims? Obviously this has bigger repurcussions I don’t exactly want to get into, but I’m just wondering about it from a philosophical standpoint.
