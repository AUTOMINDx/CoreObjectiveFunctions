Mucasy Blood in toilet (can this wait for the morning?)
I’ve had digestive issues for the past couple of days.
Having to go to the toilet multiple times a day it feels like an IBS flare up.

Lots of mucas yesterday and today was lots mini diarreah attacks.

Tonight before going to bed I went to the bathroom with the urge to push but only manages to push out mucas but it had strings of blood in it.

I’m very gassy and have stomach pain too.

I’m scared I have IBD or something worse 
:(

I don’t have a temperature or anything.
It’s midnight now.
Can this wait out till tomorrow for a doctors appointment?
