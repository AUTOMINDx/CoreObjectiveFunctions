Do festivals of other religions have the same effect on music as Christmas does?
(Apologies if any of this is ignorant to your faith.)

Do followers of Islam crack out the Ramadan bangers, or do Saudi people care which song hits #1 at Eid?

Does the Holi festival have a set track list that comes out every year?

Does Hanukkah come with a month of carols?
