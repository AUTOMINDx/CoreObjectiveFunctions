Accepted job offer but pre-employment drug test is taking an unusually long time (2 weeks), and I haven't received a call to provide documentation of prescriptions. Should I say something to the employer?
I take medication that shows up on a drug test. 3 weeks ago I interviewed for a job, was made an offer, and accepted it. Went through the background check and drug screen as normal. They collected the urine sample and sent it to the lab. I've gone through this before, and provided prescriptions, never had an issue. Usually the drug test is immediate and I can just give documentation to the tester right then, or they take it to a lab and I get the call that afternoon, give prescriptions, everything is fine.

This time after giving the sample, I have heard nothing in nearly 2 weeks now. I've called to make sure everything is ok, I haven't been able to reach the person in charge of the drug test results, and they haven't returned my calls. Employer said they got an update that it was sent to the review officer. Still, no call. I'm getting worried the employer is going to get the wrong idea or cancel the offer or something. The test almost feels like it's going way overboard to find something I can tell them myself is there.

So should I just tell the employer about the prescriptions? I usually don't, I just give it to the testers. But I'm really anxious here that something's wrong and I want to say something that might explain it. But at the same time I don't want them to know about my condition because I don't want that to frame how they think of me.

Should I just wait this out or tell them straight up?
