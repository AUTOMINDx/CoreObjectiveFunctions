Man, it's hard keeping all this up
I have no idea where to go from here. My boyfriend broke up with me, family drama stirring up again, increased anxiety attacks. It's really hard to keep up the courage of showing up to school. 

I'm having much more suicidal thoughts but I know I'm going to make it out okay, eventually. I used to be able to talk about all this and feel okay but my ex is now acting like I don't even exist, that's why I've been venting a lot of here recently. Don't need anyone to reply, just need to write out my feelings.

I feel like I'll be okay eventually, I mean, I lived like this before I met my ex, but this is slightly more difficult. Hopefully this doesn't last long.
