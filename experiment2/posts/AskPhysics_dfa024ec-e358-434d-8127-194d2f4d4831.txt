Is There a Material That a TOF Sensor With a 940nm Laser Could Transmit Through?
I'm using an Adafruit VL53L1X TOF sensor in a circuit, and I wanted to cover the sensor with a black tinted plastic/glass material for aesthetic purposes. This sensor transmits a 940nm laser, and when it comes in contact with an object, it will reflect off of the object and come in contact with a receiver on the sensor. I have found IR transmitting acrylic materials for sale, that pass through 940nm IR. My question is, will this special acrylic cause the IR light to reflect off of it in any way and give a false reading to the sensor, or will it completely transmit through and maybe absorb some of the IR, and allow the TOF sensor to work normally?
