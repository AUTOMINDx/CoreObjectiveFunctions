Pursuing PhD in power electronics after 6 years of experience in the field
Hi,

I am planning to start my PhD in electrical engineering next year and quit my job in top tech company where I work in the same field.

I would like to hear thoughts from other PhD students/graduates who returned to school after industry. How was it for you? Was it worth it? Do you regret it? How was the financial situation especially if you had a small family?

Edit: to give context, I have a master's degree, work in Canada and plan to do my PhD in US. 

Thanks
