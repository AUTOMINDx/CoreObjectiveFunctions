Education Advice: moving from Computer Science
Hello wise people of the economics community.

&amp;#x200B;

Excuse me if this is in the wrong place (and please let me know where to ask if it is) but I am wondering what the feasibility of moving into an economics-related career is as a computer science major.

I've nearly completed the program but over the last few months have discovered an incredible passion for economic theory, research and just a love of the discipline in general. 

Since I'm nearly complete with my computer science degree I was wondering what options I have for moving into the field-and if pursuing a masters in Economics (or a sub-discipline) is a good idea. 

So my questions are:

  
1. Feasibility of moving from computer science education to career in economic-heavy field

2. Educational path after bachelors to end up in career in said field

3. Degrees to look at in order to make myself marketable and competitive in the job arena
