Coworker called me a white b*tch yesterday
Yesterday while I was at work a new (22m) coworker called me (22f) a white bitch. He said it jokingly but I have no relationship to him outside of work so I found it quite disrespectful and it was completely random for him to say. He then called me a bitch again later on that shift and when I said “don’t call me that, that’s rude” he replied saying “don’t get offended when people call you a bitch”. 

I told my manager what happened this morning, who told another manager, who ended up telling a lot of my colleagues. I have no idea why this manager would do this but I’m guessing it was just something to talk about for them. 

Either way I now feel really stressed, I’m worried that now everyone knows rumours might start to spread or things might start being twisted, I don’t want my colleagues to think I’m a snitch for talking about this with a manager or to come to conclusions about me if this new coworker ends up being fired (he’s already rubbed a lot of people up the wrong way for being very full on but I don’t like feeling I’m the reason for all of this). 

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation? The thought of coming into work next weekend and possibly having to face the coworker I reported (as he might deny everything when my managers are inevitably going to talk to him) or my coworkers who are now aware of everything that’s happening really off putting as I haven’t really been in a situation like this before.
