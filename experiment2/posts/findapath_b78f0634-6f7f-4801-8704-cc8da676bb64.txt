19M gifted kid burnout, stuck in law school and I hate it
Growing up I’ve always done very well in school but never had major interest in any subject. Conceptualizing things to memorize them and vomit them out on next day’s test was a fairly simple task and I aced my classes with no problems.

And then along came university. Quarantine destroyed me mentally and I lost all desire to learn and live. I drank back in high school because of that, and had issues with learning overall. High school ends, exams are over and I don’t know what to do. Now my parents are quite the tradition oriented people and want me to go for law. I’m against the idea because I don’t find that subject to be too interesting. But since I had no other option I decided to at least try one year and that was my mistake. I don’t understand anything, I find it to be honestly boring, I hate the rude people and I’m more lost than ever. I’m depressed, have trouble getting out of bed and my mornings are spent crying without even eating breakfast.

Looking at my current situation, graphic design is something I’m somewhat interested in. I’ve been learning various programs almost every day but it’s not something that makes me literally ooze passion when I do it. I do it because it’s kind of fun and I’d probably be good at it. But my parents keep threatening me that it’s a bad job, pays poorly and they’re extremely hesitant to offer me support unless it’s a subject that they like.

I’ve never felt more stuck in life and I don’t know how much I can take anymore. My passion for learning is but a small flame of what it used to be and I don’t know how and where to reignite it.
