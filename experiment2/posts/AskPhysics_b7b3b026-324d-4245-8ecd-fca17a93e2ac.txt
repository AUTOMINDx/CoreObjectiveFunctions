Question about PVC suction cup UV degradation.
Hello, I've read that PVC suction cups obtain brownish because of UV, but I couldn't find any study showing how much this degradation affects the flexibility of the suction cup? Do you have any‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­idea or study if it will get harder because of UV?
