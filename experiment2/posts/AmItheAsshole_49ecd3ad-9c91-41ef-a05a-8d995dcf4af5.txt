AITA for not wanting my son to go to Florida on Christmas day?
For background, I am a 27f and my son is 9 years old and in 3rd grade. We life in Kansas, and his grandparents live in IL. When we lived in IL, my son would go to their house every other weekend, and he has a good relationship with them.

Today, I was asked if my son would be able to go to Florida to Disney with his grandparents, and his cousins and their parents (whom I dislike) for Christmas (like ON Christmas day).I said no, because I want him home with me on Christmas (and I frankly don't keel comfortable with him being that far away at this age).

Then, I told his grandmother (same one who wanted to take him to FL) that he was probably not going to be able to come for a week during Christmas break because he's failing 2 classes, but if he gets his grades up, he would be able to go to IL for 6 weeks in the summer instead of 4. When I said this, I was hung up on.We have been planning things to do over the summer, but haven't been able to do them since he goes to IL every summer since we moved.

Am I the asshole for not wanting him to be in FL on Christmas day?

UPDATE- I fell like there are some things I should have said, but forgot. 

1)  my son had literally NO interest, he's been asked. This isn't the first time they had plans to go down, but last time, they fell through and no one went, 

2) 1 of the other kids is his half sister, the others are her siblings, but not his. Their parents are all around mean and hateful, hence the reason I don't like them.   
Then 2 of the kids are his ACTUAL cousins. There are 6 kids going, not including him. 

3) I would have been a little more open minded if they had planned it in the summer, not on a holiday that has ALWAYS been spent with family. 

4) his grandmother has a very bad habit of crying when she's told no for any reason. 

5) I'm not going because I wasn't asked. 

I thank you all for your input.
