A "friend"/person to check ourselves
I feel having someone to check on and that checks on me could help. I need to die but i cant bc im my sisters only family. I need to find a way to deal with this situation. I feel this could help

As you can tell im alone. I dont have close friends to ask for help. 
I feel ill snap. im so sad the pain feels phsycal i cant describe it with words.

If no one thinks its a good idea its expected im insane for even thinking on it i guess but i had to try, i cant lose much at this point.
 Deep inside me i still have a fantasy of becoming a human of worth and having a good life
