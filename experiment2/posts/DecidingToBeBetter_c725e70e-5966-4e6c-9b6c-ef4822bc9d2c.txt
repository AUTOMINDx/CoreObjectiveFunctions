how do i finally get the mourning and closure i need?
this may sound weird but… i feel like i need a good 3-5 days of pure depression and ugly crying and no self care in order to move on, but something is preventing this and its really detrimental to me…


long story short my best friend of like almost 20 years died suddenly a few months ago. (end of july) at first i seemingly didnt “feel” too bad but as time goes on im feeling worse and worse. these past couple of weeks have been so bad and i dont know why. everything makes me think of my friend.


i think my grieving process was fucked up because the same weekend it happened i had to go to a wedding of a close relative and act happy and normal. that felt so messed up for me. the next week i had to go back to work.


anyway. im feeling worse and worse. i never had a period of pure mourning. in some context or another ive had to carry on and act normal.


im getting to a breaking point. i feel like i need a good 3 days straight of crying and sleeping and not eating and crap like that. 


but something keeps stopping me. my body wont let me cry for more than 5 minutes. something makes me go to work. somethibg makes me do the dishes. etc. its also so, so stressful. letting the emotions build up really irritates me. my heart and chest physically hurt.


i just really need to let go and just cry and cry. i want the feeling of giving up on everything and just wallowing in sadness. i dont know whats stopping me from this but i need to get rid of it.


i really feel like i need this release. how can i accomplish this??
