Back pay related to hourly differential that I haven't been paid for [MN]
So I started my current job back in June of 2021. I was told I would receive a $2/hr differential on Fridays and Saturdays. I get my paystubs online and I checked a few days ago for the first time and noticed that I have never received the differential on any of my paystubs. 

I asked a coworker if we get a differential and she said yes. She said that you have to punch in differently (cook f_s on the time clock). I was never told this when I was trained in or at any other time. Otherwise I would be sure to do this. 

My question is do they have to pay me for the differential from when I started back in June or any of the Fridays and Saturdays??
