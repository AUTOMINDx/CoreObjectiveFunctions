Dealing with my girlfriend 18 year old son
This young man is 18 about to turn 19 with no independence or value of self worth. Don't get me wrong he is in high-school and doesn't do drugs or party but my issue is now he is living in my apartment now doesn't wanna work , doesn't clean nothing , doesn't go outside always sitting on my couch 24/7 playing games. Gets into disrespectful heated arguments with his mother because he simply doesn't want to take the bus anywhere not even 15 mins from my place. .. this young man is stressing me out. Everyday seeing him not move from the couch.. not cleaning up. Not helping anyone with anything.  .. I really don't understand. No friends. He always expects us to play with him and when we don't he throws a temper (he's 18).. I don't know what to do
