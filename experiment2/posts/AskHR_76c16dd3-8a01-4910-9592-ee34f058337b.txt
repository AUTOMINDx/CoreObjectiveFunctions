[OH] How quickly is EyeMed policy cancelled after ending employment?
My final day with my company is on Thursday. I wanted to get a eye appointment in before the coverage ends. Would I be able to go to the eye doctor, and order a new prescription on Thursday or Friday? How fast are these policies cancelled after your employment ends?
