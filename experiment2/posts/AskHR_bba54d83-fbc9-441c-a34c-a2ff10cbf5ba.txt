[IT] Why is taking so long to get hired?
I did all the interviews at a new hotel that still needs to open. The HR director told me that he wants to hire me but it has been about 20 days since the last interview with the general manager.

Is this time normal for an opening of a hotel? Of should i start looking for something else?
