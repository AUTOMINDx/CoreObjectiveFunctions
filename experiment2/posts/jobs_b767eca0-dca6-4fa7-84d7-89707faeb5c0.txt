Picked up an extra part-time job and they're already scheduling me outside of my availability.
Ugh.

I picked up a part-time job at a coffee shop in a grocery store nearby. During my interview, I gave the hiring manager my availability for the holiday season. Clearly typed out on a physical piece of paper. It's nothing crazy, a few afternoons I can't work and 2 full days when I'm absolutely NOT available. However, I did offer to work the mornings (until 1pm) on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. Also most weekends I can work at least one day. He said great, you're hired. 

Cool.

Except apparently this guy doesn't actually run the coffee shop and never communicated any of this to the guy who *does* run the coffee shop. He didn't even pass on the piece of paper. 

I find out today that they already scheduled me for one of the afternoons that I need off and that the two days I can't work at all fall within a "requests off will not be honored" time period around Christmas. So it's very likely (according to my new coworker) that I will indeed be expected to work on those two days AND that I could also be expected to work until 5pm on Christmas Eve, which would require me to miss an important family gathering that requires travel.

What. The. Heck. Why? 

I mean, I get why. They're short staffed and they need people, desperately. But are they really expecting me to just cancel all of these plans, some of which will result in financial loss, just... because they said so?

Smh. What do I do?
