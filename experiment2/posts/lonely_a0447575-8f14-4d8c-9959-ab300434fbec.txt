Most of the time I'm glad that I don't have to worry about checking my phone/replying to people. But sometimes... I miss having that someone to chat nonsense with.
From the little daily nonsense stuff to the big philosophical things. Having someone to chat with, but on a deeper connection than just a friend, is something I miss so much. 

I guess I'll just go back to listening to podcasts to pretend I'm part of something.
