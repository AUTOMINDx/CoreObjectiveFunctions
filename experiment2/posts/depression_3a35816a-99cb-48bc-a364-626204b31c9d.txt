I don’t feel human
I feel like a shell of a human being, like I have no emotional depth, no deep thoughts, nothing beyond the surface. I’m often unable to get my thoughts together and feel somewhat confused, I disassociate all the time, I don’t know what normal humans feel or think on a day to day basis but I am not experiencing much of anything.
