Atrial Fibrillation - now on beta blockers and anticoagulants - is it safe to do ‘activities’ that would ordinarily spike my heart rate?

Had a concerning episode of Atrial Fibrillation this weekend that lasted a few hours (I’ve been having little episodes for months but didn’t know what they were cause could never catch one on an ECG or echocardiogram or at the doctors office, it was actually my Apple Watch that alerted me!) I ended up in urgent care and they caught it on the ECG and chemically corrected it. I’m now on Rivaroxaban and Metoprolol to manage it until I can have a cardiologist appointment.

My family doctor was not super helpful this morning (understandably as he’s not a cardiologist) and said I need to wait for the cardiologist appointment to see what’s happening and hopefully why, and it could be a hot minute before I get one cause everything is so backed up. However I was a little to shy to ask about sexual activities that may spike my heart rate ordinarily and whether or not it was still safe to do them with my husband while on this medication.

It’s embarrassing and awkward to ask, but thank god for places like this on Reddit…please help?
