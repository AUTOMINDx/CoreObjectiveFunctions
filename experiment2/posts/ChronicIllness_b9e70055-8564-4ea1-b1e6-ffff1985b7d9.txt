stuck in a loop with doctors
so i seem to be stuck in some kind of loop. when i go to see my GP i get told to go to A&amp;E to have emergency scans and tests run but then when i go to A&amp;E they do the bare minimum and tell me “you should be seeing your GP about these problems” even when i tell them my GP is the one who sent me to them. wtf am i supposed to do
