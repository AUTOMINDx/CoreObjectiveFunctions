I am feeling sad and helpless after having fight with my husband.
I am 27 year old woman. I had fight with my husband today. It has been almost two year, we are together. He is really mad at me. My situation is really complicated. Actually, I was a new immigrant(USA) when I met my husband. I don’t have friends. I don’t know anyone here. So, I depend on him emotionally. I don’t know how can I make myself strong and independent. How can I make friends. So, I can go out with them for movie and lunch.
