My nMom took us to different medical doctors each time so they wouldn’t be able to pick up on the abuse
She was in my doctors appts up until I was 17 years old too. The doctor had to kick her out at one point. I could tell the doctor knew. A lot of people did in retrospect. As far as I remember they only took me to the doctor regularly. I was the one that was “healthy” and with good grades. I served as the cover up in the early years.

My middle brother has received little to no medical attention. Something more sinister was/is happening to him. I think the younger one got a bit of medical attention but not sure because we (he knows my parents are narcissists) suspect my mom malnourished him on purpose. He ended up being really small and skinny as an adult. Shit she underfed me too and I responded by eating everything I could get my hands on outside of the house. Pretty sure I had an eating disorder and body dysmorphia. 

It’s honestly blowing my mind that my family was able to maintain this for so long. It’s all crumbling now and the truth is bubbling to the surface.
