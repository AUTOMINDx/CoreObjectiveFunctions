am i silly for being triggered over a joke
a friend of mine knows i can't handle being 'booed' on a bad day, i have PTSD and recently another student (D) has been booing me multiple times a lesson, this isnt just him saying boo it's him grabbing my shoulders and yelling boo or rawr in my ear. i tell him not to because of my PTSD and that it sets me up to be anxious the rest of the day, i almost punched him in the throat not on purpose, he booed me and i panicked thinking it was my ex about to put his hands around my neck so i hit, i luckily stopped myself before making contact but he's been treating me like a monster since, he still boos me. this has made my anxiety worse and i feel horrible for not being able to take a joke but this isnt about him.

a friend we'll call tom,  knows how much its been affecting me that D has been booing me everyday so i assumed he knew the no scaring ben rule was everyone not just D, yesterday he grabbed me by the shoulders and pretended he was going to throw me out the big window, i panicked, went mute and ran off, when i was younger my mum and brother would try to get me to jump out the window (my mum was very mentally ill and thought i was a demon so tried to get me to pass away) and my brother tried to push me out of our window many times so Tom doing this jokingly messed with me. am i in the wrong for not being more clear about what is and isnt okay to do to me as a joke? my friend felt badly but either of us have said sorry
