Need to go to the pharmacy
Can I make it to the pharmacy on this sunny, 30Â° day without wanting to form into a ball? I mean, it's literally 3 mins from me. I can see it when I leave my apartment! If it weren't for that dang fence separating us... 

I think I can. I actually kind of have to since I'm almost out of my meds. (Yay me for having one extra day on my script!) But seriously.  Merp.
