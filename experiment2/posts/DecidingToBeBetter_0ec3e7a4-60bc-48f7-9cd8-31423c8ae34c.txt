It feels like my life is getting back on track
I am becoming more responsible. Operating out of love rather than fear. My body is becoming healthier and a better place to live in. I am taking new challenges. I feel courageous and confident. I feel connected to the world. I cannot believe this me, a person who, two years ago, never believed it would ever get better, who did not want to live anymore.
Some things I can suggest to those courageous people here trying to get better:
1. All the answers are inside.
How much it might seem that there is something outside of us that would fix us, it is wrong. All the answers are inside of us. We just need to get in touch with ourselves. 
I used to feel extremely lonely, I always thought I need more friends, better communication skills but at the end I found if I am not connected to myself, my external connections would not be good. Meditation, yoga and mindfulness have helped me a lot in this area.
2. Physical health is extremely important for mental health.
Since I have started eating clean and exercising, my mental health has improved a lot. I feel much more energetic throughout the day to work.
3. Avoiding emotions is a bad idea.
This I think is the most important part. No matter how crappy we feel, we should face our feelings. Emotions just want to felt. We feel them and they move. In the past few months I have had huge emotional releases. I cried a lot. Sometimes continuously for weeks. Sometimes 5-6 times a day. Letting it all out led to major shifts. As I do not run away from my emotions anymore, I do not feel the need to supress it with smoking or drinking alcohol. It feels like everything is falling into place.
These are somewhat generalized suggestions. If you want elaboration on my experience on any of them I would be happy to do so.
