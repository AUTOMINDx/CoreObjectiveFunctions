Should I be reading my sun or rising/moon sign?
Whenever I listen or read my daily horoscope, I tend to pick my sun sign, Cancer. However, both my moon and rising are in Pisces, and while I feel like a Cancer, most traits of Pisces resonate more with me. Should I be reading the Pisces horoscopes? Or stick with Cancer?
