AITA for limiting where my SIL's service dog can go?
I honestly think I might be in the wrong but also I don't think I'm being unreasonable.

My brother, Brian, and sister in law, Claire, are visiting me. I'm not entirely sure how Claire is disabled but she has a service dog. Her service dog is a golden retriever, so sheds a lot. 

I'm not a huge fan of dogs but I understand Claire needs her service dog. I did ask a few things, though.

I asked that the dog stay out of the kitchen, where food is being prepared. I think that's a little gross, having the dog hair floating into peoples food. I also asked that the dog not go into the main bathroom with the shower. The next request was that the dog not go in the basement. This is where my cats food and litter boxes are. I also asked that her dog not go on any furniture, aside from her bed. Finally, I asked her dog to stay on a leash when outside to not scare my chickens. 

Claire was upset at these rules. She said I'm being unfair and that she needs her service dogI think they're reasonable to avoid dog hair getting places it shouldn't, but also I know I might be the asshole because she needs her service dog. 

AITA for setting these rules?

Edit - because this has been asked, my cats are mainly in the heated, finished basement, but they are able to come up into the house if they want to. They are also not allowed in the kitchen, bathroom, or on furniture(to the best of my ability).
