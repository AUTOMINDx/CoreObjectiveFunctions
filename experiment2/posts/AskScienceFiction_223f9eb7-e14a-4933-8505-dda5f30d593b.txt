[Image Comics] So how does the Hercules Method compare to the general concept of Chi Energy for the most part?

I know the Image character, Luther Strode might be rare to a lot of people. But I assume the video would help get a better understanding of his powers and the idea of the Hercules Method.

The Hercules Method is a subcategory of the Body Supremacy power. Where the user can control 100 percent of their body. Doing stuff like turning off their pain receptors like Moon Knight, healing quickly like John Wick, being strong like Captain America, etc. So could the Hercules Method overlap with Chi Energy a bit? I'm not necessarily talking about the DBZ or Wuxia version of Chi Energy. I'm more so talking about Iron Fist or Shang Chi level Chi Energy. So my main question is. Would the Hercules Method overlap with street-level Chi Energy because of similar power mechanics?
