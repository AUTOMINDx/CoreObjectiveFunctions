Does anyone get scared of being laid off or fired? If so, how do you cope with the thought?
At the start of the pandemic, I got laid off and that affected me a ton because I worked so hard. next thing i knew I was on unemployment for more than a year. I have since found a job with alright pay and benefits, but the ‘what if’ of being laid off lingers in the back of my mind consistently. Not to mention tailoring your resume and looking for a new job takes a while. How do you cope with these thoughts?
