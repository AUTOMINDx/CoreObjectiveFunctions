What happened to the anti consumerist movement?
It is a bit difficult to describe, so please be patient with me. I am referring to the general anti consumerism movement that I saw a lot more of during the early 2010s. What happened to it? Was it all just rhetoric and no action? Did it morph into something else or did it dissapear? When I saw it I thought that it would become a lot more dominant as a movement.
