How do i find the effects of any explosion?
there calculations to the effects of any explosion size(chemical,nuclear,antimatter,etc)?
Do I need thermodynamics to know how far away from a blast I need to be to not burn?
Do I need fluid dynamics to know the wind speeds at any distance?
What formula do I need to calculate the amount of radiation from a distance?
How do I find out the temperature of the center of the blast?
How do I find out the surface temperature of the fireball?
How do I find out crater size?
How do I find out the shape of smoke rising from an explosion?
Please help me understand.
