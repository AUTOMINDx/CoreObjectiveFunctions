Are there really places ok shouldn't try to flirt? Why?
So I've heard from women that you only certain places you should attempt to flirt with them. I get that but then when I see women posting their "how they met their SO" stories it's a lot of it are things they say you should not do.

Like there's a lot of "sliding in dms, giving number to while they're at work, on the street, at work, their boss, one person even said a funeral ffs.

So maybe I'm not understanding why they tell men not to do these things when women themselves do it of seem ok with it happening when certain men do it
