Just Need Some Advice.
Buongiorno/Buonasera, Hi guys I have known my sexuality for about two years, however I have been very, very adamant in coming out, to my friends and family.

I've decided to ask you folks for help.

(Forgive my bad grammar)

Now, I live in a small (very conservative) city in Western Australia, and basically almost every adult I know is a coalition voter (conservative), or are just very homophobic in general.

My entire family is conservative, and the vast majority of them voted "no" in 2017 national referendum for gay marriage.

Not to mention my uncle attended a homophobic Christian lobby presentation at my local theatre.

Now I have a very close relationship with my entire family, (we meet every Sunday to have dinner, and stuff).

I know for a fact that if they they knew I was homosexual I will be attacked for it. Why? because I already get attacked for being a Labour supporter (Left-wing party in Australia).

Now, my friend group. The majority of my friends are right-wing, and you know its bad when one of them constantly sends videos of Ben Shapiro, and Steven Crowder "owning the libs."

I've had to correct a few of them, because some of them are saying homosexuality is a "choice" not a "natural-state".

Here's a good time to mention that I am in A Catholic School, which stuffs religion down our throught, and there has been cases of homophobic behaviour between students.

*Cheers :)*
