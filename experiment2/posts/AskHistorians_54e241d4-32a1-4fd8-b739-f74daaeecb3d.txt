How would Belisarius's Triumph look like? How was it compared to the triumph Ceasar for example.
So I kinda understand how the Republican and Pagan Imperial triumphs went. There are a couple of good videos on the subject. But How did Belisarius's triumph go? Because the Classical roman triumph had a LOT of symbolism with pagan roman religion. From the red face, to the jupiter=triumphator parallel, to the killing of the enemy leader. All of it was seeped deep in classical worship. Clearly Christianity had an influence (as for example the king of the vandals being spared). But the whole Jupiter paragon was removed I supposed. Or the whole signs explaining the scenes of battle. Or even more importantly the fact that it was done in Costantinople and not Rome (Rome had a bunch of religious laws with the pomerium).   


Was Belisarius's triumph complex or was it a simple procession? Was there an equally deep meaning to the rituals perfomed during Belisarius's triumph? How was it different from a triumph in christian rome post costantine? And how different was it from the triumphs of the medieval era?
