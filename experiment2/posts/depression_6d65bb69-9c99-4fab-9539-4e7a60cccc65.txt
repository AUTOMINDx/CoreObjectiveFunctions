Just need to get some stuff off my chest
(17M) I feel like my life so far has been pretty pathetic, I've never felt connected to anyone, I've never really had a friend or been to an actual party in over 7 years and still don't have one I could even come close to calling a friend. When it comes to family I know they love me but for some reason I don't feel loved, if anything its kinda stressful just being around them and I prefer being off on my own even though I crave affection more than anything. I can't even remember the last time I held someone's hand or had a genuine hug and even though I crave it I'm afraid to look for it as I always wear a mask to avoid seeming abnormal when I'm around people because I'm never able to tell anyone how I feel and just end up saying I'm ok apart from strangers on the internet over text. I'm scared of taking to new people especially over phone calls so much to the point where when I was applying to a college and they called me I never had the courage to pick up the phone and ended up blocking their number. I've been to a therapist 5 years ago due to self harm but I was never able to talk about my feelings and in the end lied to my parents that i was able to quit even though I still cut to this day and will probably never tell them. Even though I cut multiple times a week sometimes I don't know why I do it, I don't think I'm depressed which makes it feel invalid but I never really know what I feel anymore and don't really have much motivation.
