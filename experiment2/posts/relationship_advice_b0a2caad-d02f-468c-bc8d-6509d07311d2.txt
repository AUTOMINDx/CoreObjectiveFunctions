I’m losing interest with my boyfriend.
I(f19) have been dating my boyfriend(m20) for about 5 months now, it was very exciting in the honeymoon phase but now I’ve completely lost interest. As soon as he started relaxing and got used to me, I started to see his true colors which I don’t really relate with. For example, he forces his humor on me when I make it painfully clear that I do not get what is so funny to him. Sex used to be really nice but he doesn’t really try to please me anymore, and he’s horrible at taking hints. Other than going on hikes and watching movies we really don’t have anything in common and I feel like we’re wasting both of our time. Should I just get it over with and break up with him?
