Help: my boyfriend says I cheated on him while I was drunk at the club, but I (nor anyone else) saw
For some context, my boyfriend (20), a few friends and I (20) went to a club and all of us were pretty drunk. I remember everything that happened that night (or so I thought). We got into a fight right before and he didn’t talk to me or wasn’t near me in the club from what I saw. But, later he told me that I apparently grinded on another guy. I don’t remember this, nor did I see or feel another man behind me. I asked one of our friends who was with him the entire night, and he also said that he didn’t see anything and would have stopped it if he did. But, my boyfriend is clear that he saw and he would definitely not lie about this. What do I do? (I can’t tell him I talked to our other friend about this) please help!!
