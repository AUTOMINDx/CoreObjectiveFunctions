Stuck, lack of motivation, want to be programmer
Hi guys,
So background info;
I’m 22 years old, originally from Sweden but currently living in Berlin, Germany since the past 2,5 years as I moved here straight after Highschool. 
I have been working here for the past years in just random call center jobs and cafés, which has been fine up until now that I am unemployed and kinda feeling done with the unfulfilling jobs I’ve been at. Im right now going to a language class to learn German, but im only at A2 level.
I want to go to university and get a BA to begin with, preferably in comp. Science as is like to work in the tech industry with aspirations to become a programmer. However to study in Sweden my grades are not good enough, as I was depressed through the first year of Highschool, so I can’t get in. Also I’d rather study here in Germany as I have most of my life here now, but German universities only offer computer science BA’s in German. And as mentioned previously my German is definitely not good enough even though like 80% of the courses in the program are in English, the parts in German will still be lacking. Meaning the public universities not the private ones as I can’t afford this, also seems a bit scammy.
I just don’t know how to move forward in the direction of becoming a programmer and creating a future for myself. I’ve looked into coding boot camps but from what I’ve read these are not super highly looked upon either. In hindsight reading what I’ve written now doesn’t sound too dramatic, but I just feel so so so stuck and I don’t really know how to move forward. What are other ways to become a programmer? Or other suggestions as to what I could do? 
I just feel as if I’m not smart or good enough for anything.
