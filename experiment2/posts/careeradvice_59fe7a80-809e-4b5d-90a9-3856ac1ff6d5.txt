Career that combines accounting and tech?
I'm a senior Accounting and Computer Information Systems major. I will be graduating in a few weeks from a state university with a GPA of 3.63. I've had the opportunity to do an internship this year in the accounting department of a mid-sized tech company. I also worked for Wells Fargo during my sophomore and junior years. The problem is, I don't necessarily know what my value is as I move forward with applying for jobs. I feel lost. I thought completing my degree, gaining some experience, and maintaining a decent GPA would push me into the right direction, but I honestly just feel...lost. Not sure if Im competitive enough or if there are more boxes I need to check off...Also I'm not sure if it would be best for me to lean more into information systems or into accounting. I do know that I have a deep interest in auditing and fraud prevention.
