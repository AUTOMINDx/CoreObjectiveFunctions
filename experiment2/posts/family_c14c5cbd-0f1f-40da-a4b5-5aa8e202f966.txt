I have a sister and a brother but...
I'm 23 years old and I have a younger sister and brother. But, I haven't seen them since I was 4 years old. I've been watching this show called "Long Lost Family" that showed family members finding each other after a long time. It got me wanting to find them, so I decided to post here and see if anyone could help. Anything from showing me a website or anything. I can give more info on them, all that I know.

My grandmother raised me when I saw born because I was a sick one, my mother (not to say anything terrible and go into complete detail) couldn't raise me because she was unfit to. She had my sister two years after I was born and then my brother. Later her and my dad separated and my two siblings went to foster care.

My mom passed away before I was 6 and my dad was in and out of prison.

I was 6 when my grandmother went to court to get them under her custody, but my grandfather passed away before the court date and the judge told her she couldn't take care of 3 kids all on herself.

I faintly remember my sister, she would always hug my leg and laugh whenever I would visit her and leave. I don't really remember my brother too much. I just hope they're okay and living a happy life, I still live with my grandmother, I take care of her and been with her all my life.
