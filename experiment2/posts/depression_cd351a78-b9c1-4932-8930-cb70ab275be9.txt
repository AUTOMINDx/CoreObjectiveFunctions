It's all over
Basically the title. Finished writing exams in my final year of college and I KNOW I'm getting kicked out. Failed every single course in my first semester, and I KNOW I'm going to fail everything in this semester. I just had no motivation this year to do any studying, felt like I had no purpose in life. 

I'm a computer science student, 21,  and it's been my dream to become an app, game and software developer. From what I've done in college the past 3 years, I just don't see how it helps with me achieving that. That's why I've just barely been scraping through each of the years. Last year, in the horrible covid pandemic, I BARELY passed 4 of the 6 courses I did (failing the other 2). While this year was just beyond horrible.

My parents are the type who are extremely strict, want all their children to go to college and finish with top honours. It's been so much pressure on me (being the firstborn of the family). I cried myself to sleep many nights because I don't believe I live up to their expectations. I've even thought of ending my own life maybe when Nobody is looking or is at home.

It's not the first time I've been put on academic expulsion, it happened in my first year as well, so that makes it so much harder to believe I'll be given another chance. 

My family don't know that I'm going to fail, they think I'm graduating. I just want to end it all.

What do I even do in this situation. I guess it really is over for me.
