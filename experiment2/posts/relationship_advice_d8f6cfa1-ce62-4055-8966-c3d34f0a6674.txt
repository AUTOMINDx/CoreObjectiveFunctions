How to convince my boyfriend that I’m serious about breaking up?
I think my (25F) boyfriend (31M) and I have hit our final straw. Earlier we had a fight in which he said “sometimes I have to yell at you” and did everything to justify it, essentially said he has learned nothing from me (even though I’ve expressed that every time we fight I say it’s my fault and I try to figure out what I did wrong), and said that I should express that I want with the understanding I have to expect him to disagree, when lately I’ve been trying to go with the flow to avoid conflict. On top of that, he does not pay rent (we live together and he’s on the lease), does not clean even though he says he will, and is yells while gaming during quiet hours and says that will not change no matter how much I ask him to be mindful. There’s also a previous post i made a few months ago about how he dresses.

The problem is I have a mental illness, so when I try to say that the relationship isn’t working, or most anything really, he says I’m “in a mood” and says to wait until I “feel better” and “more rational.” Is there a way I can make it clear that I actually want him gone?
