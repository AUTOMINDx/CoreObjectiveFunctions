MRI tomorrow and I'm really nervous
Updating! Hi! I had my MRI this afternoon at 4:30 and made it through!!! I counted my breaths and switched between singing Damh the Bard's "Under the Trees" in my head and imagining a music video for it haha! The forest I imagined was absolutely beautiful and I want to go back there asap! (To the forest my brain came up with, not to get another MRI lol!)

My neurologist wants me to have an MRI due to new things happening with my chronic migraine, she mailed me the form in October and I never got it done. I tried, I really did. I scheduled it and went in, but as soon as I got in the machine I had a panic attack and they asked me to reschedule. I had a MRI years ago and did great, so I thought it would be no problem. I'm disappointed in myself. All the thoughts just rushed in when I laid down, what if it's not safe? What if I pass out in there and die? What if? Goodness am I tired of what ifs. I rescheduled, and now it's tomorrow afternoon. I thought I'd post here and see if anyone has any tips for me, or even just a positive story about their experience. 

Adding in that I've been in therapy for my anxiety disorders for a few years now. Currently trying to find a different person to see as my current therapist is not helping me at all.
