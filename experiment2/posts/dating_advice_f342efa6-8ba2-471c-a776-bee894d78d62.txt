Gym Crush
There’s this girl that I go to the gym and I’ve had a crush for the longest time. For the past month she’s been using the squat rack next to me. And asked me to spot her a couple times. I just don’t know how to introduce myself or carry a conversation after she asks me to spot her. We make eye contact with each other and hold it frequently. Sometimes I get the feeling that she’s looking at me and naturally my eyes gravitate towards her. But I try my best to not stare while she’s working out because I’m scared that she’ll think I’m creepy. 

She always works out with a hat and headphones in so I don’t want to interrupt her or come off as creepy but I really like her. 

Side note: I started working out because I wanted girls to notice me but I still have anxiety when it comes to approaching girls. For some reason I have a big fear of rejection.
