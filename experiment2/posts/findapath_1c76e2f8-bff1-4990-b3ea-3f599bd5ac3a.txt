Realization Today
This morning, I was making a list of career paths I am considering and strengths/issues/questions about entering those sorts of roles. I realized something:

**I NEVER wanted a B.S. in Computer Science.**

During the past 3+ years after obtaining that degree, I managed to completely forget that I never wanted that major. I initially chose a degree in Software Engineering, but switched after realizing that our college wasn't accredited for that. Am I good at math? Yeah, but I only do it when I force myself and then get burnt out after a while. I do love solving puzzles, but I always get fed up with coding after a few months, whereas my classmates loved it as a hobby.

In case you were wondering what I've been doing in the meantime... I basically ran away, joined the circus, and travelled the world as a job. Circus was my hobby in the same way as coding/building programs was a hobby for many of my classmates. Now, my body is breaking and I'm trying to figure out what to do next.

Trying to figure out where to go from here! **How can I get people to overlook my degree in CS**? People always assume I want a technical role upon seeing that, and while I've agreed to help with that on projects if *absolutely* necessary, I keep getting thrown into coding positions on short projects that I volunteer for remotely and hate it. Looking into systems analysis and project management (which I ended up doing often for smaller class assignments in college) because I'm an opinionated control freak with a breadth of technical knowledge. **What would you do if you were me?**

**ETA:** I enrolled in the Career Foundry UX course last year and didn't finish it due to 1. burnout and 2. getting rehired for the circus. I enjoyed my UX and research classes in college, but did not enjoy the self-paced course and relearning things. I loved talking to people and doing research for projects, though!
