Eye contact?
I’m most certainly about to come off as slightly serial killer-style, but….Does anyone else here have a issue with eye contact? It’s way too intimate for me, and I kind of feel like someone is trying to look into my soul. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE! ((ESPECIALLY when a wink is involved!!!))) &lt;—- then I just feel molested. THOUGHTS??
