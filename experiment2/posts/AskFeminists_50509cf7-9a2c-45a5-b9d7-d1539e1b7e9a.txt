You think it's time to abandon and relaunch feminism under a new name?
Thing is the kill all men and men hating/women supremacy took the name feminism and ruined it and by calling youtselfs by the same name you make the group look bigger than it is

So my proposal leave feminism form a new group and call out these things bevore they can gain momentum in the new movement




Eddit to make clearer what I want in a Mathematikal way
X= the reputation of the name
Y= the propagande put up against it

X=Y times the years the name exists

The reputation of the name got bad so by changing the name you get a fresh X with no propaganda against it(sure the propaganda will come back but it will take time for it to get bad again) so what you gain is more followers while the rep is still good = more power = you reach the goals faster
