Hi guys I need some help
I’ve been on and off lexapro and mirtrazipine due to side effects and this week I’ve been having severe scary thoughts and deceptions that everything isn’t real. Like this isn’t my own conscious or I’m in a coma and need to get out and it’s freaking me out and has me panicking. I’m not sure if this is anxiety or withdrawal but it feels just like how my brain perceives things now.

I took an benzo to help with physical anxiety but I feel it did nothing to help with my thoughts and delusions. Not gonna lie this has me suicidal and I feel like I’ve gone crazy. I think this may be something psychotic as I don’t think I feel physical symptoms I’m not sure.

Any advice?

Thanks,
