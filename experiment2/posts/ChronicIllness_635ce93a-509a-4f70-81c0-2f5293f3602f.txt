How to Manage Chronic Illness and a Narcissistic Parent?
hi there, just found this community.

I’m a college student with gastroparesis, and recently I’ve been having severe flare-ups which have lead to me fainting at my day job. it’s been like this for a while, but I didn’t tell my parent until today due to not wanting to deal with her guilt-tripping me.

when I was younger, I almost died etc etc and she always turns that around on me, acting like a superhero for providing healthcare to a gradeschool-aged kid. today, I finally told her about my flare-ups and she did it again:

&gt;	You texted me that you’re having symptoms of something that almost killed you. I’m your mother and that time was the most terrifying time **I’ve** ever been through.

her being a narcissist isn’t up for debate, she has a long history of being one. but I was wondering if anyone here can sympathize or offer advice? I’m dependent on her for healthcare for at least another year, so I can’t just to no-contact like I want to. I’d appreciate anything.
