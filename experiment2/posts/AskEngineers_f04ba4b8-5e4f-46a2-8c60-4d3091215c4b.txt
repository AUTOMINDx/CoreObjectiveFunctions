Can a multimeter measure random object electrical resistance?
I'm not electrical engineer
But I have this curious question about electrical

how to measure electrical resistance of the material? can I just stick multimeter to the random object to get its electrical resistance?

For the example can i just stick multimeter to rubber band to get its resistance?

Or multimeter just work on conducting object?

I tried to search it on internet but I still have no clue I don't have multimeter btw, thats why I ask
I really appreciate the answer, thx in advance!!!!
