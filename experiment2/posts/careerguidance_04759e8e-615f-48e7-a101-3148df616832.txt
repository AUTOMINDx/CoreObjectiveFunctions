Would it be strange if I downloaded Grammarly on my work computer?
I'm writing and grammar skills are pretty subpar. I have been trying to work on that, but I have a long way to go. In the meantime, I've thought about getting Grammarly on my work computer, so that my emails would look more professional. Is this a good idea?
