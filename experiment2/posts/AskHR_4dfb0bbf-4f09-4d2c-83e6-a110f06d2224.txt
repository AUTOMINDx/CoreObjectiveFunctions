[OR] Workday Goal Weights - How do they impact overall achievement?
My team asked me what percentage of goal-weight you need to be at "Achieved Expectations" in order for your overall rating to be Achieved, and I cannot locate and answer. Now I'm curious for my own performance rating... 

For instance, my team has four goals with weights of 65%, 15%, 15%, and 5%.

If they make Achieved on the 65% and 5%, totalling 70%, would they make Achieved for their overall rating even if they only got Partially Met on the other 30%?

This came up because prior to this year our main goal was weighted 80%, so no matter your performance on the other goals, what your rating was on the main goal was what your overall rating would be. 

I have gone through my HR docs and tried Googling it to no avail. Thanks!
