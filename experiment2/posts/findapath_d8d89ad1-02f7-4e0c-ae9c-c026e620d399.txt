Electrician looking for career change. IT or Programming? Dreaming about remote work.
Hi! 

So Im finding myself in the position that my career choice is no longer working for me.

Im 33 y.o. Electrician by trade, love to work with my hands, repairing stuff, wrenching on my vehicle and such. Always wanted to live in the countryside and work on land. Having orchard, vineyard, small hobby farm always was appealing to me, I like to get my hands dirty and pick fresh produce from my garden in the morning. While living in big city only managed to enjoy a bit of gardening on my parents backyard, but keep on wanting more haha.

Lately my wife started to rock the boat about leaving Canada and moving to Balkans where people live more relaxed lifestyle and sea is warm and food is good and life is cheaper:) 

While I was refusing her idea at first as total nonsense, now Im realizing that if we do move I will be able to afford my dreams and desires to come true...

Im coming to realization that my current trade and skills wont really work to support my family if we will be moving and I need to change my career so I can work remotely.

At this point of time I have no idea of what kind of remote work will fit me the best. I would love to utilize my trade skills and experiences, but not sure how I can fit them with remote work...

   
 

Thank you.

Will greatly appreciate any ideas.
