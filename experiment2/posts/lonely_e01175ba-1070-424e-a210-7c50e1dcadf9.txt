I have decided to kill myself after my parents leave this world.
Yes that's right , I have made this personal decision.

I am 27 and have been lonely for 10 years.

I have no one that knows of my existence apart from my parents .

After my parents are gone, I will also soon join them too.

I don't want to live in a small flat all alone.....loneliness is worse than death.
