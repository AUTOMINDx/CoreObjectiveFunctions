My mum's story, not mine
In the 80's, my mum lived in flat that had more than one floor. Obviously since it's the 80's and people cant keep their legs closed, there was loads of little annoying kids cutting about the place being absolutely ruthless. My mum always got bullied by these wee crappy kids, but that day they took it too far. Maw was minding her own business wearing roller skates, then these 2 kids ran up to her and tried pushing her down the flight of stairs. I mean, obviously my mum was absolutely terrified. She was screaming and crying because she thought she was going to die! And, in my opinion, it's not a very good feeling. After a while they gave up because she wouldn't fall down the stairs. Later on, my mum ran up to her mum's flat and said "MAW THAT WEE \*\*\*\*\* \[name\] TRIED TO PUSH ME DOWN THE STAIRS IN MY ROLLERSKATES!" And my gran went absolutely ballistic. She ran down the stairs and knocked on the kid's door, and waited. Just kidding, she nearly bust down the door banging on it. Eventually, the kid's mum answered the door and my gran said; "Your daughter tried to push my waen down the stairs on her roller skates!" The kid's mum started boiling with rage. "\[name\] GET OVER HERE!" And so she did. "DID YOU TRY TO PUSH WEE \[my mums name\] DOWN THE STAIRS?" The kid was absolutely terrified. Her mum's rage could've given the sun an extra million years of life. "e-eh, no mum! She's lying!" She stammered out, absolutely shitscared, and without another word, her mum raised her arm, and absolutely wacked that wee b\*st\*rd right in the face! Wee bawbag never bothered my mum ever again :D! I posted this here because pro revenge and petty revenge wouldn't let me :(

TL;DR - Mum nearly died, the kid who done it got beat
