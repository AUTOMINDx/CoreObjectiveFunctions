[Train to Busan] In Seoul Station, how much money did Hye-sun owe her former pimp to make it worthwhile to track her down during a zombie disaster?
Suk-gyu, the former pimp of Hye-sun who is pretending to be her father, is complaining that he can't live in a nice place like the final apartment area because Hye-sun hasn't paid her debt back to him. It would have to be a lot of money for him to risk his life with zombies.
