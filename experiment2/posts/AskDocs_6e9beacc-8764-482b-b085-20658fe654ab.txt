Is this a yeast infection? F22
Long story short - I was diagnosed with a UTI six days ago and prescribed the antibiotic Bactrim. I know antibiotics can sometimes cause yeast infections but I’ve never had one before so I’m not sure if I currently do. 

I have no itch, and the discharge has no smell- but it’s white and thick and kind of resembles spackle? 

I’ve attached an imagine and I plan on going to the doctors but was hoping I could see what someone else thought in the meantime ! 22F F22
