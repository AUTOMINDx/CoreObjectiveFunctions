Keeping friends is hard
I like to see myself as outgoing, easy to talk to, blah blah blah but after some time has passed and my friends group is close to being established I start to feel depressed and anxious and I want to shut myself in side. Like I suddenly hate everyone and feel like everyone hates me and I just want to start over some place new. Is this a Fear of commitment?

I just feel sad and I want to get away and I don't know why. They're all great people who are kind and considerate and fun but everyone I start to get close to a group of people I become really depressed and idk why or what to do
