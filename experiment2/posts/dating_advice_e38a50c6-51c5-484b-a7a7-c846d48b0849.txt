is 2 months too soon to send affectionate text messages?
i’ve (27m) have been dating this girl (26f) for about two month. we see each other about twice a week and it’s been going really well. i can definitely see this becoming something more serious, but right now we’re just taking it slow and spending time getting to know each other before rushing into anything. 

i find myself wanting to send little random text messages telling her how much i enjoy spending time with her or things i appreciate about her, like her beautiful smile or infectious laugh. 

i’m just not sure if enough time has passed to warrant these types of affectionate messages. she has shared with me in previous conversation that she gets scared when things move too fast and i don’t want her to think i’ve fallen deeply in love already or something. i just want to communicate  somehow that i genuinely like her and appreciate her company
