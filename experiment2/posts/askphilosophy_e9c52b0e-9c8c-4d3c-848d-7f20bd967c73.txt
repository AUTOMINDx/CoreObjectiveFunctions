Resolving a dilemma in a novel
Hi -- I'm working on a novel (first-time, but I'm a best-selling business author with a doctorate in business.) I have a dilemma in this historical thriller. In the present day, the protagonist locates a stash of gold and jewelry obtained from concentration camps and taken to S. America in 1945. Assuming it's located on private property, in a country with lax rules on war reparations, what are options a thinking protagonist should consider? Possibly some of the jewelry would be personally identifiable, but by people who are long gone, and not traceable. So it's unlike art reparations which usually come with some provenance that can be traced. Ideas? TIA
