If a marshmallow were to hit someone at velocity of 300 km, will it harm them?
Basically, me and this person are having an argument about something dumb and he's claiming that if a marshmallow somehow reaches a velocity of 300 km, then it can be like a bullet and actually harm someone. I say no. Obviously, I want to know the answer and how incorrect statement is incorrect.
