I have a second interview tomorrow morning, how should I prepare?
Hey everyone! This sub has been a great resource for me in the last year and a half, so I'm hoping some of you might have some nuggets of advice to share with me again :)

I recently applied for an entry-level marketing assistant position with a small video game studio. A few weeks ago, I attended an in-person interview with two members of the management team, and I received an e-mail on Friday to ask if I could have a Zoom meeting with them some time this week. This meeting is taking place tomorrow morning. 

I've been told that this meeting is mainly to ask some follow up questions, so I'm looking for an idea of what to expect from this. I graduated from university last summer, so this is one of the first 'adult jobs' I've interviewed for, and this is the first time I've been asked for a second interview, so I have no clue how to prepare! 

I should add that this second interview is with the same two people who interviewed me before. My first interview felt quite thorough, as it lasted about 75 minutes, so I'm a little stumped on what to say or ask that I didn't cover with them before. I've racked my brains for some things to ask them about in response to our previous interview (for example about working from home arrangements), but I'd like to know what sorts of questions I should expect from them, or anything else that I might want to brush up on for tomorrow morning. 

Thanks in advance for the help!
