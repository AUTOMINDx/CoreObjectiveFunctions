AITA for choosing a long song to take a shower to?
My (16M) mom got this idea from a tv show she saw a couple of years ago that, to reduce water waste, that the family gets three songs to choose from while we take showers and as soon as the last song ends, we have to get out, whether we are finished or not. 

We got to choose the songs so I chose two relatively short songs (1:44 and 1:32 minutes, respectively and one very long song - 9:30.) My mother is now pissed off at me for choosing such a long song but I need time and I use cold water anyways...plus I do other things to cut down on water consumption. But she made the rule specifically so we could help out the world and I kinda undermined her.
