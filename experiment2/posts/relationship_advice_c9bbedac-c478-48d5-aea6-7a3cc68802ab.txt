I (22 f) caught my husband (21 m) telling another woman that he loved her. He told me that they had a “friendly” relationship for about a year. We have been together five.
I’ve been stationed overseas in the military for a couple years. My husband and I both agreed to this, and we were going to work on getting him here with me. Long process with covid. 

My mother (43 f)  called me one day and told me she saw my husband in a store with a woman, and that the woman was putting her arm around his shoulders. Now I didn’t think much of this, and thought that maybe my mother had seen her guide him through a crowd but took it the wrong way. I left it alone. He said he was getting her car parts. But I started to have a feeling that something wasn’t right after that, so I asked for his log in information. He fought me tooth and nail, so I then knew something was definitely happening. 

We fought for three days and he finally gave it up, and obviously, it had been cleared of anything but his male friends. I searched through his block list and found this woman’s snap, and found their saved conversations. They spoke every day, he was sending her sexual memes, and was telling her “goodnight, I love you!” Messages. This obviously screwed me up, and I’ve been a mess.  He says that he got caught up because the distance was hard, and he used her for emotional support.  He stresses that nothing physical happened between them, but I dont believe that after him having this relationship for a year and telling her that he loved her, that there wasn’t anything physical going on. He lied to me for a whole year. Potentially right under my nose when I was able to finally visit home. 

I’m just not sure what to do. He’s already lied to me, and I honestly can’t trust him when he says it didn’t go farther than what I saw, but part of me still wants to believe him. I’m stuck.
