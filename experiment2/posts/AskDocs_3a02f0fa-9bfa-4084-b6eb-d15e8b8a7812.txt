Hey, 17 year old male here, I was just wondering when I should start worrying if my girlfriend is 5 days late on her period. She does also eat irregularly and may have an E.D. which may affect things but I just was wondering if this could be anything other than pregnancy?
Maybe I’ll get her a pregnancy test next time I see her i’m just really worried right now. To be fair, she does have irregular periods however.
