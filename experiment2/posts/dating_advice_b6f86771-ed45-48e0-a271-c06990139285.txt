My work colleague...
Me (F21) am in love with my work colleague, he's incredibly attractive to me, i feel like a teen again when i look at him or talk to him, he's very socially present in the work place, a very happy, positive person, likes to make jokes now and again, works hard, his ego is kinda big, we exchanged some messages and i felt like he was into me, but when i asked him out he said that day he couldnt, and then said that he doesnt have much time for me bc he's always with his friends when he has free time, but said we could go out next week, i know that he does not have enough interest in me to make time for me, and he, in his convinced pants, told me i could go to the park he stays in his lunch time, (later in my dms), i told him where i stay and yold him he could stop by if he wanted to, and he never showed up, guess i know he does not like me and lets me in the corner to be a second option maybe, (my hopes are still up bc i feel this teen love with him, cant avoid having hopes) im feeling so good when i think about him i cant stop myself from liking him, im trying to move on but damn, he doesnt leave my head. I tried distracting myself in all heathy and unhealthy ways, he doesnt seem to leave my mind, and i dont want to go to him and tell him about how i feel bc i feel like he will turned me down if i talk sincerely about hou much of a crush i have on him, what do i doooooo? Help ;-;
