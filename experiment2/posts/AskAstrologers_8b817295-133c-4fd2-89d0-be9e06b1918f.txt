Can my Ascendant change into other sign after moving abroad ?
Hi folks,

I’m very worried if my Ascendant can change into other sign if I move to other country which is part of my plans. In general, I really like my Ascendant (as it’s the only Air placement in my natal chart) and I consider it to be a very important part of my personality so the thought of it changing into some other sign makes me really uncomfortable. 

Any thoughts on that?
