I like going out, I just don't.
I (27M) don't have much experience in dating at all, and I found one of my main concerns is my answer when a woman asks me about my hobbies. I am a homebody, no doubt about it, but I genuinely like getting out and doing stuff. I'm always down to go hiking, camping, just driving, strolling around town, etc... when I'm with another person/people. If I'm by myself, it takes a LOT more motivation to get me to go out. I have a few friends/family members in the area, but they all have families/lives of their own; everyone else is spread across the country, so my social life is mostly over the phone/internet.

Whenever the question comes up, I answer honestly, while keeping the more personal reasoning to myself (there's a bit). From my perspective, I answer calmly/confidently so I don't give off the image that I'm talking down about myself.

Does this make me look desperate or something? I know that's a very not good image. I'm not the best conversationalist to begin with, but it gets worse when I'm trying to impress a woman. I tend to stumble on my words, and frequently second guess everything afterwards.

I know there isn't a whole lot to go off of here, but I'm trying to keep it limited to relevant information.
