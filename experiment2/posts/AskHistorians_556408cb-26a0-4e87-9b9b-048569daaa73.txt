"Don’t you worry, &lt;The British&gt; are not going to shoot any of &lt;the Easter Rising fighters&gt;, they'd be much too afraid of America." Why would the British fear a response from the United States from executing Irish republican fighters in 1916, or rather, why would Irish republicans believe they would?
This quote was relayed by Cumann na mBan member Brigid Lyons Thornton in the 1970s documentary *Curious Journey* about her time spent in prison immediately following the 1916 Easter Rising:

&gt; Early that morning then I heard a terrible volley of shooting and I asked the one who came to me, a Miss McInnerney, I said ‘What was all the shooting this morning?’ And she said, ‘They were shooting some of the men.’ Now I didn’t know who or what and I didn’t believe it. Later that day we were let out for about ten minutes’ exercise and we met a lot of other girls who had been at other centres during the week and I said to one of them. ‘I heard they were shooting the men.’ And she said, ‘Don’t you worry, they’re not going to shoot any of the men. They’d be too much afraid of America.’

&gt; Well the next morning the shooting was on again and again and again, every morning after that at about five o’clock. I could hear the men marching out down by my cell door, a heavy march and then out and then the volleys.

Why would the British government fear some kind of response from the United States for executing what, from the Downing Street perspective, were unlawful rebels? Would the British have feared a U.S. government diplomatic response specifically or more a negative response from the American (and Canadian?) public? And more importantly, was an American response even a consideration at all for the government? If so it didn't stop them from executing 16 men. So why would Irish republicans *believe* that the British government would care?

Thank you!
