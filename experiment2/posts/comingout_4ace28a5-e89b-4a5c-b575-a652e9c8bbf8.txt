I did it!!
Hi Reddit! I am a 28 year old Cis male and Im happy to say, I finally came out publicly! Last week I came out as Bi-Sexual. It was 90% positive. My mother tried to give me the birds and the bees speech again and she told me that my grandmother wouldn't accept anything that has to do with gay anything so She told me let her remain ignorant. I'm so glad I did. The support I got from my friends and most of my family has been really great :) I've been holding that in, trying to avoid family judgment for nearly 10 years and it was such a relief. 

I encourage anyone, if it is SAFE for you to come out, regardless of what part of LGBTQ+ you are part of, I encourage it and support you :)
