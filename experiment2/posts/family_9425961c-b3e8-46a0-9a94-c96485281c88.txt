I love my dad and uncle
So today I thought my dad deserved to be spoiled for putting up with a very pregnant and hormonal me.


I made him an apple tart and forgot the sugar realising this I went to get the cream but his brother called over and they were sitting at the table and when I came back the plate the tart was on was empty bar a few crumbs.


"what happened to the tart!"
Dad "I only had a slice and your Uncle only had a slice and it was gorgeous. Forget the sugar everytime."
So yeah the slice was half a tart but as I made it for him I'm glad it worked out.
