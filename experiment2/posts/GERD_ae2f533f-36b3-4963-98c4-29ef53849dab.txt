egyptian licorice tea?
been getting really into drinking tea recently, and found out that licorice tea is good for GERD, so i picked up some yogi egyptian licorice tea because why not, not taking it seriously as a medication but i'm exploring different kinds of tea anyway. googled a bit while drinking it and now i'm freaking out about glycyrrhizin warnings (i have very bad health ocd lol), and everyone in this sub who takes licorice takes the de-glycyrrhizined (DGL) kind. wanted to ask if anyone has had any adverse reactions from this tea. i'm 19 and in good health except for persistent post-concussive syndromes but i doubt that's relevant.
