Synastry aspects for a deep emotional passionate physical intense merging + deep understanding . Less primal in a pure sexual way, more emotionally bonded but definitely intensely passionate.
I’ve been researching for quite some time about synastry aspects…And come to the conclusion that I would like for the LomL (who i either haven’t met yet or we still have to start dating) to have some „intensely passionate-probably 8th H“ aspects 
(I wouldn’t call it dark since I’m totally against any kind of abuse, always for genuine unconditional love). 

Like for example:

- my moon, Venus or Mars in my LomL‘s 8th house (that person being an 8th h person). 

- Pluto/moon or Mars/Moon aspects. 


I believe what I desire is -above all else - a deep emotional passionate physical intense merging + deep understanding .
Less primal in a pure sexual way, more emotionally bonded but definitely intensely passionate. 

I think sun/moon aspects or Venus/moon aspects are definitely cool for me in friendship, since they emphasise more the emotional understanding between two people but for romance I definitely need more. 

Know what I’m talking about? 
Sizzling chemistry, it can’t be only sexual. But it can’t only be „romantic“ either (hard to find the right words here). Genuine erotic love - is probably a better description. 

Do you think the aspects I mentioned above are fitting?


Some info about me:

I’ve got my own Venus in Leo ♌️ 12th house - with my Mars and south node being there as well. 

My Venus is in exact opposition to my moon in Aquarius ♒️ with my north node being there.

My Jupiter in Gemini ♊️ 10th is in exact trine to my moon and I’ve got an exact Jupiter sextile Venus aspect.

Also my Eros is in Libra ♎️ and Psyche in Aquarius ♒️.

(I’ve got an exact Saturn/Neptune conjunction in Capricorn ♑️ 5th house)

Do you think the synastry aspects I’ve suggested are good for me?
