Do I have sever anxiety?
So, everyday it feels like I am on edge. I’ll be fine for a little while, sometimes feel non existent even, and I will suddenly think of something bad that causes me to panic. I have had a past being terrified of tragic events happening that hasn’t actually happened to me. For example, school shootings, fights, death, etc. It is odd because it is only these things that will set it off, and I can never imagine those things happening. I also can think of why people would do bad things like that and this subconsciously puts me in their shoes, and I then panic because I think I’m just going to go insane one day because my brain puts me in those people’s shoes that do those things. I can’t wrap my head around it, and I still feel strong emotions toward everything.
