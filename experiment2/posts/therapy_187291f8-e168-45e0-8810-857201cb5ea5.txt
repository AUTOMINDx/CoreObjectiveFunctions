I don't have anyone to talk to and I need to vent
i can barely get out of bed. I lie there for hours staring at the ceiling. when I do get out of be I'm constantly exhausted mentally and feel like I need to sleep, but It's so hard to stop my thoughts. yesterday my mom got mad and yelled at me for constantly forgetting things and messing things up, so I yelled that I know and that it's a serious problem, and that I hate myself for it, when people yell at me about it I hate myself more and more and that I need help. she ignored everything that I said and she only focuse on that I cussed and she said that if I ever cuss around her she'll ground me forever.
