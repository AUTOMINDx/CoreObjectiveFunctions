Talking to someone about my problems makes me so uncomfortable
Talking to anyone even my closest friends always ends up in regrets. I don’t know if Its just that I don’t like being consoled, but isn’t talking about problems allows for solutions and words of comfort? I don’t know. I am so agitated and overwhelmed. I’ll eventually get over it, I guess.
