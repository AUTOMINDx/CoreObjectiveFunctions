I don’t know if my girlfriends parents will accept me because I had a kid
I am a (20M) but I have a daughter, and my girlfriend (20F). We are in a tough spot in our relationship, I’ve known this girl for years, I’m meaning like 8 years and for that time, she was my bestfriend, I love this girl like no other. It wasn’t until now that we’ve confessed our feelings. I’ve always had a small crush on her when we were younger but I’d never thought it be anything. It wasn’t until 7 months ago she told me how’s she’s felt and we’ve been seeing each other a lot more then we did before. I love her a lot and I can tell she does too. My family loves her too. The only problem is, I haven’t met her parents , and the problem is, we don’t know what they will say or how they will react if she got with me because I have a kid, they already know I have a kid but they don’t think I’m dating their daughter, which is why they haven’t said anything. She’s afraid that them not accepting me might be a reason on why our relationship could end. Is there anything I could do to help convince that I am good for their daughter? Or what can I do?


My daughter is 3 now. But I don’t see her mother, we’ve been out of the relationship for 2 years now because we can’t workout and it’s best that we just went out separate ways and just speak for our kid and that’s it
