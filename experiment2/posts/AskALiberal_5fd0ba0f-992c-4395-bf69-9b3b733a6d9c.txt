What guides your moral compass?
Just remembered a conversation with my old roommate who couldn't understand how I had any sense of right or wrong without the Bible as my guide. I thought it was such a weird conversation. I didn't have a good answer because I'd never thought about it beyond "don't be a dick," plus the Bible rehashes so many older philosophical and religious principles anyway he might as well have been saying "...without the Code of Hammurabi and Greek philosophy as your guide."

But anyway, I still don't have a very insightful answer to it, but maybe some of you do. So what guides your moral compass?
