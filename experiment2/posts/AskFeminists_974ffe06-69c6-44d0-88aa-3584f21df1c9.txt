How do you feel about sex selective abortion, aborting for the sole purpose that the child is female? How should it be dealt with and should it be legal?
I have had the position that abortion should be legal for all instances but people aborting on the basis that the child is a girl makes me reconsider. I donâ€™t know what to think here.
