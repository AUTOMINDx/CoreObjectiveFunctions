IS 34 TO LATE?
Struggling right now to decide on a career change and thinking it’s to late to start a career is social work (id need to go back to school). The thought of 4 years of education and then job searching terrifies me but I’ve never felt more pull to a career path like this in my life 

Help PLEASE
Tell me I’m not crazy
