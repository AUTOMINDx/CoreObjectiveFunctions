Back to Work and out again.
I restarted work after a 2 month break. I was deeply depressed and anxious in those 2 months.

First day is almost over. But the whole time I felt a sort of pressure in my head.

But I did it. Back full time.

My work is on terrain, so that means that I'm miles away from my city most of the time.

But I think it's gonna go good this time.
