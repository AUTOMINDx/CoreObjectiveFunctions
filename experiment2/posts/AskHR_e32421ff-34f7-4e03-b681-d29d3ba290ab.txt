[NY] Reasonable accommodation under ADA
Employee makes request for reasonable accommodation under ADA due to a a job restructuring initiated by employer 1 year ago. Employee has exemplary record with company and no corrective actions during nearly a decade long tenure with company and (while able to complete new duties satisfactorily) is requesting reasonable accommodation due to a previously undisclosed chronic illness that has never impacted employee's ability to perform work safely.

Employer requests form filled out by employee's treating physician that confirms diagnosis of a chronic illness with no cure. Employee requests two different accommodation as options ( Accommodation #1) **OR** Accommodation #2).

Employee replies that they can approve only **BOTH** accommodations (but only together) and furthermore states that this accommodation will only be for a 3 month span of time and will then be reverted. That according to ADA rules the accommodations are not permanent. That employee can then again apply for accommodation again which will involve documentation from physician again.

Employee asks for legal language mentioning a limited time frame for accommodations under ADA.

Employee provides the following info via 2 links:

[**https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada#general**](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada#general)

[**https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12112a**](https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12112a)

Neither seem to mention such a time frame.

What are the legalities under ADA here? Can HR, knowing that employees medical condition will not be resolved grant only a 3 month accommodation.
