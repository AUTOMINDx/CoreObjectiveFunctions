I don't matter
My thoughts and feelings don't matter. I always get invalidated. My feelings are always dismissed. They minimize my feelings they say things like 'that's part of life grow up'. It makes me feel like my feelings are wrong. Nobody cares. They just pretend they do then they leave when I make myself vulnerale. They have no reason to stay. Friend knew I have a fear of abandonment. They left at my worst. They always hurt me. They tell I could tell them anything but when I'm talking to them they don't even listen. Worse is I get called names which makes me feel like I'm faking my illness and I'm just being dramatic. I guess I deserve these things because I'm such a shitty person. No matter what people say I still don't fucking matter.
