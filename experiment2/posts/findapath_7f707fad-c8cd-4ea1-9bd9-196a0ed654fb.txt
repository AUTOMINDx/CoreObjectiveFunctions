Do the work first, then allow for magic
Lately, I've been obsessing over every little outcome in my life turning out just the way I want/hope, without remembering the power of surrendering after I do my part.

There are so many different 'results' we can get attached to:

* Achieving clarity on our path
* Building a viable business
* Transitioning to a new career
* Generating income from our passion
* Finding a romantic partner
* And so on

Sometimes the most obvious ideas come back and hit me like a tonne of bricks. Recently, that idea was simply this: \*whatever will be, will be.\*

I talk about this a little more in a youtube video I just created: [https://youtu.be/pleA0laLbzw](https://youtu.be/pleA0laLbzw)

This is how successful people approach life:

\- They set their intention

\- They show up regularly

\- They do the hard graft

\-And then... they simply let go (perhaps even \*rejoicing\* in the unknown and unknowable outcome that lies ahead)

This 'high intention/low attachment' mindset is vital to cultivate, whatever you're doing.

I hope the above video gives you a dose of inspiration, and perhaps permission to surrender your the illusion of external control to whatever forces you believe in (even if that just means 'luck' or 'random chance').

I would love to get your comments, questions and opinions on this video.

(If interested, I'm also offering free coaching for young professionals in their 20s/30s around career transformation; see the youtube video description for further info).
