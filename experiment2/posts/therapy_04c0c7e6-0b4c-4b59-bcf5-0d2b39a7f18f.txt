Therapist ghosted me?
Long story short I needed to reschedule a virtual session, new time and date was confirmed between myself and my therapist. The new date comes around and no meeting link has been emailed and I did not hear from them after the scheduled meeting time has past. This was a month+ ago and I have yet to hear from them again. I would like to continue therapy seeing as it was beneficial to me, but feel like if I return to my previous therapist it will be awkward after so much time has past without any communication. Has this happened to anyone else? What do I do? I feel weird and almost abandonedâ€¦.
