How important was Roman aggression and religio-cultural influence in creating the Bulgarian identity and would they have gone the way of the Avars without a strong Eastern Rome.
This post is being made in semi comparison to the Avars who although had  some success in having the state identity bleed down to the conquered  slavs for the most part failed in that and had the Avar identity vanish  soon after the state was conquered, similarly with the Huns who were  even less successful, while the Bulgars and later the Magyars were  successful in that with even the Magyar language surviving. 

I once heard that why Bulgarian identity survived while Avar didn't was  that the Bulgarians had reason to try and absorb in all the society into  their identity and slavs into the warrior aristocracy to better resist  Roman attacks. Now I also seen the argument that Christianity also  played a major role in that, so in a world where there are practically  no major Bulgar-Roman wars, would the Bulgarians being much more  territoriality  closer to Christian institutions be enough to forge a  Bulgarian identity or would the lack of any major treat allow a Bulgar aristocracy to maintain itself as a separate caste from the rest.  
 

Now on the post of Christianity playing a role in forging the identity, I  have also heard that a powerful and Christian Eastern Roman threatening  the Bulgars also made them associate Christianity as the enemy's religion. A none threatening (or non-existant) Eastern Rome would make Christianity be  looked upon more favourably but could also make it look like a weak religion not to be adopted, as well as pull out some of the major Geo-political reasons for adopting Christianity.
