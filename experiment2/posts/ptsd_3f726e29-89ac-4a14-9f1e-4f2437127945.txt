PTSD zoom groups
Hi everyone!

I have recently began my journey to better my mental health and started my sobriety journey also. Due to surviving abuse, a rough childhood and traumatic events throughout my adulthood I have been recently diagnosed with PTSD. I was curious if anybody is apart of or knows of any zoom groups that I could join? Google hasnâ€™t yielded any results but any and all information related to the matter of healing and growing is also welcome! 

Thanks!
