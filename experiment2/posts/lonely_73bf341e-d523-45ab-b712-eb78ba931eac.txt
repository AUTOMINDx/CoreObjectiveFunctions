Hopefully this can help anyone having a hard time
I recently saw this video online about this guy who was just speaking of having a difficult time when it comes to dating and since that video it really  stuck with me since I knew exactly how he felt. He mentioned how he had tried various dating sites and he tried to put up cool photos of himself and even paid for the premium service that came with the apps. But he still would not get any matches. What stuck with me the most is when he said that "he wasn't anybody's type". I felt that to my core and I can't stop thinking about it. I have never dated and I have never had anyone show any interest or affection towards me.

I realized that I'm not anybody's type either and that's ok. I have been finding different ways to feel fulfilled. I have been able to find hobbies that I enjoy and I see my friends when possible.  When I would have a negative thought about myself or felt like I was getting down. I'd tell those thoughts to go away. For a long time I would feel really depressed and down on myself about it. I always felt like there was something with me and that I needed to change myself but some of us are meant to show love and not receive it back. I know my solution isn't perfect but it's been a small step in helping me hopefully be able to manage my depression better then I have. 

I know this time of the year can be really difficult for a lot of people so this is for anybody who has never had a match on a dating site, had anyone interested in you, felt love and affection or who've never had physical touch by another person. I want to remind you that you are not alone, you're important and there's nothing wrong with you, and you are loved all the way in Ohio. If you need someone to talk to or vent don't be afraid to leave me a message.
