No one is willing to train me [FL]
I’ve had a bumpy time at my current job. I interviewed for one position. Got offered another (lower) position. This lower position was supervised by the person whose job I interviewed for (director A). 

I resigned from that position a month in as I was told one thing and they didn’t follow through.

And then got offered a contract position in another department. Part of my new job is to learn what Director A does.

I’m pretty sure Director A knows they’re coming from her. My current supervisor has made comments insinuating such.

Through all this (it’s been about 2.5 months), I have received little training. People have just expected me to know how their systems work. I’m good at adjusting and my wife happens to be in a similar position elsewhere, so I’ve been getting training from her. Which is seriously ridiculous but I’m trying to make it work. 

Yesterday I was told by my colleague that she was no longer doing a particular job and the expectation was for me to have picked this up. The work was due by today. I managed to complete some. But I wasn’t properly trained in all of it so about 2/3 simply wasn’t done. 

I’m a little frustrated at the lack of training. When I speak to my colleague she tells me how I seem to know more than her (courtesy of my wife) but is reluctant to train me in the specifics of our organization, which obviously runs different from my wife’s job. Director A also is reluctant to properly train me. It seems like everyone thinks I’m out for their job. 

COVID was a rough time. I’m in a “lower” position because I don’t want the stress and I don’t want in-person work. I just want to do my job and be left alone. I’m not gunning for anyone’s job. 

How do I address these issues? I truly enjoy what I’m doing, my boss and I are on the same exact wave length, I really like her and I really want to make this work. But I can’t have her think I’m incompetent because of a lack of training.
