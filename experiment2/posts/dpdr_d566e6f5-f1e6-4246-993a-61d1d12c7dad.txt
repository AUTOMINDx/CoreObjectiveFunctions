Neurological / Migraine-based Derealization
Hey folks. I've been perusing this sub for a long time now after working with my doctors to find the root of my derealization issues. I have two specialists who both are in agreement that my derealization is causes either by autistic shutdown or stemming from the visual migraines I have from a rare neurological disorder called Pseudotumor Cerebri / Intracranial Hypertension. I was diagnosed with the neurological disorder in 2012 with my symptoms becoming increasingly bad until I developed episodes of blindness causes by optic nerve swelling from my intracranial pressure. The timing of my first regular derealization episodes (I had previous episodes as a teenager, but attributed them to use of a specific pharmaceutical)  began just a couple years earlier. I'm inclined to think that the root of my derealization is based on this rather than my autism primarily because I have had autism my entire life and only started to have these regular sequences of derealization in my 20's. 

My neurological disorder has made me give up driving this past year and I've noticed my derealization has decreased since starting a new treatment for my disease, though episodes still come and go based on certain environmental factors (light changing, moving through spaces I'm not super familiar with, white noise, etc). 

Does anyone else have a neurological disorder or migraines who suffers derealization? Specifically, does anyone else have ocular / optic nerve disease? I see a lot of people have their diagnosis bases in trauma, and I definitely can see that as a huge factor for the vast majority of sufferers, but I think in my particular case it is neurological.

I know Pseudotumor Cerebri / Intracranial Hypertension is pretty rare, but I'd love to compare notes with anyone else with neurological disease and derealization.
