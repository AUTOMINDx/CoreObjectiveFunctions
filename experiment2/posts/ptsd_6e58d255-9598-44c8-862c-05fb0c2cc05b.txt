Frustrated at the lack of therapeutic interventions in the US
Just read the post of someone successfully working through trauma with ketamine therapy (congrats). I've seen other posts of people who get hallucinogenic treatments. Marijuana is legal pretty much everywhere except for where I live, and when I told my doc I was using it illegally to cope with panic attacks she added "marijuana dependency" to my list of diagnoses. So I can't even get it medicinally now because I'm an "addict." I've tried delta 8 and 10 (legal here) and they just make me cranky and unmotivated without any of the benefits. I can't trust any local dealers with LSD or any other "hard drug" because I used to work in a hospital and saw droves of people coming in who took bad shit and were fucked, sometimes for life. (Seriously, test your drugs, every time. If you can't afford a test kit, you can't afford drugs, period.)

It's just so frustrating that the war on drugs and criminalization has barred me from so many options to work through my trauma. And anyone who tries to self medicate is labeled an addict or considered to have some moral failing. Like, how dare you turn to substances to cope with literal brain damage? You're supposed to pull your fucking bootstraps up to your tits and waddle up the corporate ladder, fucking *degenerate.* Medicinal, my *ass*, everyone *knows* drugs exist solely to expose your SIN, SINNER /s

Anyway yeah that sucks remember to vote thanks for coming to my Ted talk
