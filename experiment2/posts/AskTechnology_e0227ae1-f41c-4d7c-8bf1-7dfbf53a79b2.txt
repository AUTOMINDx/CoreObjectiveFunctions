How to safely dispose of broken devices?
I have two smartphones and two tablets that I can't get to turn on. They newest device is a Galaxy S5 that stopped working out of the blue and I wasn't able to factory reset it, the rest I didn't know any better to do it before letting them die. I currently just have all these devices collecting dust in the closet, but I want to properly dispose of them without compromising whatever personal data is still on them. How could I go about doing this? All my searches only gave me instructions for broken screens, not devixes thst won't even power on.
