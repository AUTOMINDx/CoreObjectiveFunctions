What do you wish you had as a child for your little engineer-self?
Hi, I'm looking for a way to help my 8 years old who is interested in engineering. He is also a big fan of Nile Red on YouTube (chemistry channel), loves origami, and building. 
We tried a free class from White Hat JR, Coding class for kids. But I'm not sure if it is worth the money. What's your thoughts?
What is something you wish you had as a child that would have helped you as an engineer?
