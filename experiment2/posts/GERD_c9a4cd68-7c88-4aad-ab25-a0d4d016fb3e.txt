Gerd Vent
When I first got heartburn and reflux I thought I was having a heart attack, I let it be because I didn’t want to go to the hospital due to covid. I stopped drinking coffee.. the healing process was rough and i didn’t take ppis or blockers bc i wanted to heal naturally, it worked for a week but then i got bad reflux again because of spicy chips, my diet is never going to be linear of course. I still at the time didn’t take any medication, let it heal naturally but the episode was bad i would get ear infections, loads of snot and arm pain. Then i decided to go to the doctor, i got perscribed famotidine and i decided to use them to see if it helped and it did but i only used them once/twice when i would feel an episode and it did work. But today i ate spicy dumplings and i got a mild episode, I’m just really upset that this will never cure. I tried naturally and i tried medication and i know i need to be linear with my diet but it’s so hard. Plus i’m a healthy weight (119lbs, 5’4/5) and i’m tired of catering for my stomach like yeah the week of recovering feels so good and i can eat what i like but keeping it linear it’s just so hard. I hope i never have to deal w gerd again i just want to keep that in the back of my mind so i won’t get panic attacks about this being a long term thing.
