Is this like EMDR?
I recently had a therapy session and was asked to recollect a traumatic memory and describe the feelings surrounding it, and then imagine those feelings as an object, like a turning sphere but to then impart my will on the sphere turning it the other way. Initially recollecting the memories I was close to tears but then after focusing on turning the object in my mind, I felt neutral again. 

My therapist was talking to me throughout and asking about why I felt the way I felt during that time in my past etc. Does this approach sound familiar? Just wanted some thoughts, thanks for any advice.
