Is Absolute Poverty really higher than relative poverty in developed countries?
Is relative poverty a better measure than absolute poverty for developed countries?

I often here conflicted things about absolute poverty in developed countries. On the one hand, the Brookings Institute, for example, says that almost no one is so poor in developed countries that they cannot afford food, shelter etc (the absolute poverty line according to the UN). Sure enough official statistics are that only around 1% of the population lives in such utter destitution.

But on the other hand think tanks say this or that about how even families well above the relative poverty line (ie 50% of the *national* median) cannot afford food or shelter or childcare. For example, one Canadian think tank says that a working family needs well over 37K a year to afford basic needs in my city, which is well above the Canadian federal poverty line of 28K a year.

So which is it?

Is absolute poverty really higher or lower than relative poverty line?
