GERD, gastritis, colitis
Hi Everyone- I seem to have colitis, mild gastritis and GERD. The latest endoscopy said hill grade 3 referring to the valve.

Anybody else in a similar scenario with bowel problems too? Is this common to have multiple issues? Feeling quite down. Not sure how this happened. Been having symptoms for two years.

My gerd symptoms are constant. I always have upper back pain, mucus in throat. Sometimes cough, and shortness of breath. There’s no flare ups as people say on this thread… it’s just constant symptoms. Sometimes they are not as bad but always there.

Anyone else?
