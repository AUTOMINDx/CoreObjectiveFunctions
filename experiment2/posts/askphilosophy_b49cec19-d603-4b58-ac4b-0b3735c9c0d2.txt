Greek philosophy and ‘religions of the East’
In the introductions to Bertrand Russell’s History of Western Philosophy, I came across the following quote: 

“'It looked as if Greek religion were about to enter on the same stage as that already reached by the religions of the East; and, but for the rise of science, it is hard to see what could have checked this tendency. It is usual to say that the Greeks were saved from a religion of the Oriental type by their having no priesthood; but this is to mistake the effect for the cause. Priesthoods do not make dogmas, though they preserve them once they are made; and in the earlier stages of their development, the Oriental peoples had no priesthoods either in the sense intended. It was not so much the absence of a priesthood as the existence of the scientific schools that saved Greece.”

He is quoting John Burnet's Early Greek Philosophy, from chapter ii, ‘Science and Religion’.

I am wondering what exactly is meant by this. I don’t know what anti-scientific aspects of eastern religion are being referenced here, or even exactly what is meant by “religions of the East.”

Any clarification would be much appreciated!
