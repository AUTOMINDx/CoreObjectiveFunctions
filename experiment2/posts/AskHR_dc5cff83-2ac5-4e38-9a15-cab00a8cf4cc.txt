[CAN] Employee may be depressed - How to broach this as an employer
We are a small private learning academy (20 employees) in BC. Our teachers do mostly ESL and after-school programs for kids. One teacher has been exhibiting what management thinks could be signs of depression, and it has affected both his work and his relationships with colleagues.  

Our benefits package includes a confidential counselling and support service that we would like this employee to take advantage of, but we are unsure how to bring this up. A couple of our concerns:  

1) This employee has a bit of a history of contentious dealings with management, and we don't want the employee to think he is being "observed" or targeted.   

2) The company may be re-structuring next summer due to covid-related enrolment issues and a push towards more online education, and this employee is probably a candidate to be let go. There is no connection between the depression issue and the potential termination, but we are concerned that trying to help the employee get counselling will open up a future wrongful dismissal claim.  

In a nutshell, how can we refer this employee to a confidential counselling resource without overstepping our authority and without opening ourselves up to liability?
