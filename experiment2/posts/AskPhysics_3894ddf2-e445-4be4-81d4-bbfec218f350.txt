Cool topics to research about relating to quantum physics
Hey everyone, I have a project that I need to do on any topic on quantum physics. I want to learn some new cool and interesting physics through this project and was wondering if any of you guys have a suggestion on a more sleeper topic (less mainstream and popular) that I can learn about. For reference I am a year 2 student in university, thanks!
