I feel my organization is expecting quite more from me
So, I'm a fresher and haven't graduated from college yet, I'm working as a freelancer in a software company, which I joined just last month and over the period I've been given quite minimal but easy tasks to do and I take up a lot of time in doing those tasks. I delivered very slow rate of completing those tasks that were assigned to me, some took a couple days which were meant to be done within a day and while in some conversation with a colleague I got to know that my organization is expecting too much from me. My organization has over 150 employees, has multiple branches in the country and no one has ever gotten in like I did, they don't hire someone with less than 2 years of experience for a fresher (My colleague said). So that puts a weird dilema in front of me, weather or not I should tell them how I feel (not to be expected too much) and see their response on that or I don't tell this and just wait till everything kinda sets down it's own. 

Idk how will they react when I say this, Any advice how do I say this to them in a respectable way so they don't set this thing in their minds when assigning me any task to do?
