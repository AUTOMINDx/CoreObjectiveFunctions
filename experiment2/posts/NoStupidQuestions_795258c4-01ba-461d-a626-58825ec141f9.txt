How do news companies get away with blatantly false headlines?
My mother nearly freaked out this morning (again) over yet another one of those headlines where its claimed that a giant asteroid is gonna hit earth in less than a week. Of course, despite doubling down in the article about how this giant thing was certainly headed straight for us, the final couple of sentences backed out and admitted the asteroid will miss us by millions of miles. I've seen so many of these bs clickbait articles and I have no idea how they are allowed tell blatant lies like this.
