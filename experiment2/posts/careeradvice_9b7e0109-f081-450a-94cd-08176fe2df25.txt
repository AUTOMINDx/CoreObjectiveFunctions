2+ Years of Experience - Ego-Boosting or Requirement?
Do all LinkedIn job ads for **entry-level** positions ask for 2-3 years of relevant experience? Is the purpose of that one line just to scare people off or is is an actual requirement? Since virtually every position that is not a volunteer opportunity has this requirement nowadays, how does one go about getting these years of experience? People are saying it's an employee market right now, but after 9 months and over 500 applications I am still getting rejection after rejection.

I have an undergrad in international business as well as an MBA, and any relevant field that even remotely interested me has this bloody requirement which is slowly driving me insane. I'm genuinely interested in creative marketing fields like copywriting/content writing, SEO specialist and affiliate manager, but no opportunity seems to be smiling my way for almost a year. Am I shooting too high? I can't imagine any other "field" where you can work your way up to a copywriter or SEO specialist.

It's been 9 months, and all I managed to find was a shitty completely unrelated internship that paid peanuts (i.e. I was the excel sheet boy doing mundane GPRs and Project Orders). My parents are putting daily pressure on me to find a job (gee, thanks, not like I'm spending every waking moment doing that) and I'm beginning to feel like the biggest failure on the planet. It's gotten so bad that for the past few nights I couldn't sleep and just stayed up creating application lists, hunting for emails, editing my portfolio. Even as I am writing this post, I feel the need to throw up from sleep deprivation.

I'm beyond burn out man, and I don't think I have it in me to go through any more of these stomach-turning job ads. At this point I'm mortified or the fact to even start a job because of this newly acquired anxiety.
