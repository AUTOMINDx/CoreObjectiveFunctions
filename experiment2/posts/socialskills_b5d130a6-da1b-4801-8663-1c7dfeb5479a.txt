Odd One Out
Hello, Reddit! I’m a young individual who sometimes feels out of place when in a social environment. I sometimes feel like I have a social disability however, my occupation requires me to have sharp social skills. I don’t understand why I tend to shut down when I’m placed in an unknown social event. I try to break the ice but I feel like my efforts are just too obvious.
