[Lost in space - Netflix series] How can there be lightning on a methane planet? [Spoilers]
This post relates to season two:

&gt;!At the start of season two, the Robinsons and co are stranded on a planet with a methane atmosphere, and also lightning storms.. my question is, how does the lightning not ignite the methane atmosphere?!&lt;

&gt;!For that matter, would the oceans be also liquid methane?!&lt;

&gt;!Did the bioluminescent plant life produce methane? Would other planets absorb carbon dioxide?!&lt;
