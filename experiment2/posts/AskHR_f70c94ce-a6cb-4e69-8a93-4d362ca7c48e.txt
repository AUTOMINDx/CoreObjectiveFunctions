Is it my fault? [NY]
Help the company where i work started to grow in three states and asked me to hire marketing candidate and so i did and long story short i chose 3 candidate have good experience and outstanding track records in the industries lets say these candidate name are kasey, larry and jhony and the manager approve

A month later, the manager called me and said, "I believed you and asked you to find 3 finest prospects, I put them and you blew my dreams." "But sir, I brought the best prospects, but I don't understand what's happening,"

The other two candidates have failed and are about to give up. So, . the manager said Why should I pay you when you can't even execute fundamental HR tasks?"

In that case, who is at fault, is it me or the manager, or the two rejected candidates?
