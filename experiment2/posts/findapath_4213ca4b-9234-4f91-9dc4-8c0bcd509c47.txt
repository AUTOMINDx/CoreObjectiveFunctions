Do I quit?
Hello, I am just trying to debate if I should quit trying to become a physician. Studying for the MCAT has really made me question if I even belong. Just as some background I have a BS in neuroscience and a minor in biochemistry and I had also graduated with an overall average of an A-. (I am not trying to show off or anything it just helps build the whole situation). I am studying for this test and had taken 6 practice tests (7 hours each) and my score was improving and this was hopeful but now it had dropped and I am back at square one. I don't want to study anymore and I don't want to continue this path as I feel like I'm just failing over and over. Although I know giving up might give me regret later on. I continue to study every day for 6+ hours and work a full-time job. Is it just the feeling of burnout that is hitting me hard or do I really consider quitting?
