Won't let me study what I want
Currently I'm studying what my parents want me to study but it's not what I want, I'm miserable in my current major. I asked them if I could change, I even told them i'd pay for it myself and they wouldn't have to spend a single cent but they still won't let me. I don't know what to do. I can't change majors without their permission but I won't last 3 years in the major they want me to do.
