What is the best advice you could give to someone going through a separation?
Currently in the midst of separating with my partner.. we are still figuring out how to separate household items, custody, etc.  Its a few days fresh and I'm stuck in an emotional Rollercoaster.  Sad, Angry, really hurt..Then happy. Theeeeen it starts all over again
