Shouldn’t the basic necessities for life be free?
Bear with me, I hope this question makes sense. 

Im sure we can all agree that water, food, housing, and clothing are all necessary for our survival. A lack of housing, for example, indirectly kills you, hence why it’s a human right. Clothing is no debate either. 

Wouldn’t it make sense to provide everyone with their basic needs for free? So free housing, free water utility, free food, etc. The idea sounds so intuitive, but it gets a lot of backlash. I’m hoping someone could explain to me why this isn’t possible. 

Thanks!
