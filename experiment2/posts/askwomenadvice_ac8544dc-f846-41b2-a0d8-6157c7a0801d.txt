What do you think about this text I want to send to my ex to let him know Iâ€™m not waiting for him
I (f, 26) donâ€™t want any confusion and when you (m,26) said youâ€™ll come to New York when youâ€™re better etc itâ€™s planting a seed in my heart . The past year itâ€™s been unhealthy 

I have to get on with my life and I canâ€™t hold on to that because itâ€™s not where we are now. Even if you mean it, if weâ€™re over we need to be over instead of be in two places mentally because of what happened the past year. So I need to see the reality and where we are presently to avoid further confusion

I say this so I know weâ€™re on the same page and Iâ€™m not being strung along for comfort. I know thatâ€™s probably not what youâ€™re trying to do either but the reality is weâ€™re not together 

If anything is meant to be thatâ€™s down to God but Iâ€™ll carry on focusing on myself and moving forward now ðŸ’™

The point of my text is I love him but Iâ€™m not betting on him returning to me and if he comes back eventually and Iâ€™m with someone else then he canâ€™t be mad about it because I told him through the text
