Looking for advice
Hi,

I currently have two job offers on the table. One is a job in the industry I want to be in (design engineering) and starts in September 22 and the other would start January 22, isn’t in design but the employer said would be a ‘stepping stone’ to a design role. 

Is it dishonest or wrong to take both and just quit the earlier one when I’m ready to start the later? If I did that should I tell them that from the start or just leave it as late as possible with the correct notice period? Don’t really want to screw anyone over and get a bad reference later down the tracks.
