How do I choose my career?
I (16F) haven't decided what job to choose or what to study in college.

I like reading some fiction books, languages (my first language is Romanian, so I know English pretty well I hope, some German and some Spanish), have recently started playing the piano, I listen to a lot of music too and also like math, physics, computers, software, etc.

I am a pretty shy person and hate being the center of attention. I would like to work a 9-5 from home and be financially stable. 

I've also done a lot of personality and career tests, but I don't know how accurate they are because sometimes I am not sure I am completely honest.

How do I go through this process? What should I do in order to figure this out? What recommendations or advice do you have? By the way, I don't want to make the wrong choice and later have to change jobs.
