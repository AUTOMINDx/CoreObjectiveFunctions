Wondering if I am over analyzing my compensation path incorrectly?
As the title states, I am wondering if I am looking at my compensation with "I am work 10x what they pay me" Rose colored glasses.

Background: I work internally doing Mergers and Acquisitions for a publicly held company. Been here for just over two years. Background is not investment banking but general financial analytics and budgeting, with a brief stint as a project manger. 

* Sep 2019 - Started at 90K base with 10% bonus
* Apr 2020 - Was going to receive a prorated % since I hadn't been there a full year; execs froze all raises due to COVID 
* Apr 2021 - Received good performance review, and boss "fought" to get me the most he could and I went from 90k to 92k smallest % raise from a review I had ever received in my professional career.
* Nov 2021 - Doing well in my position go from regular title to senior title and 92k to 102k (10.87%) and now 15% bonus 
* *Apr 2022* \- Based on previous results expecting very small raise, or expecting "you just got promoted so we wont be giving a raise" 

My concern is my promotion has been eroded since my start due to poor timing of COVID and sky high inflation. 

Am I off base in my assumption? Am I out of line to expect to ask for or try and ask for at least a CPI raise of 5.9% (SSA increase)? Or based on evidence am I stuck in a cycle of paltry raises until I can move myself up the ladder?

Happy to elaborate more if needed. And any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.
