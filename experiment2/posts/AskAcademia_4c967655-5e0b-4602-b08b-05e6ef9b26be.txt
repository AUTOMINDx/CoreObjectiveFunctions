Anyone here has experience of doing a fully remote post-doc (or of hiring one)?
I am exploring some post-doc opportunities and want to explore the possibility of working fully remotely (possibly from outside the US). My work is purely computational so I don't need to be in lab.   

Was wondering if PIs at top universities are even willing to consider such an arrangement post-covid and if it would be wise to bring this up in my post-doc interview? 

Thanks
