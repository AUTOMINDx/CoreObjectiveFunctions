Having trouble getting over someone that I barely dated
I (21f) met a guy (22m) on a dating app about two months ago and we went on a whirlwind of dates as he was going on a trip at the end of the week. He seemed to really like me and kept asking me out but he ghosted me as soon as he left.

I’ve been on 3/4 dates since then, but I can’t stop thinking about him. Like, wishing I was on a date with him rather than the person I’m with. Now I can’t even open dating apps without thinking about him. (He said he’d be back around Christmas but who knows if he’s going to text me)

I’m having a lot of trouble moving on and I don’t know what to do. I think I get attached too quickly and I just wanna know if anyone has any advice on how to not do that.
