Another forgotten birthday. Feeling lonely and worthless.
Every year my birthday gets forgotten by both family and friends. They will talk about it in the lead up, then on the day or days after - nothing. Today was no different, if anything it was worse. My husband sees me get torn up inside every year, but he never does anything to make it special either. This year I thought maybe I just wasn't communicating properly so I asked him to try and make me feel a bit special. I don't expect anything massive, I'd truly be happy with a cup of tea, a cuddle and a 'happy birthday' in the morning. But he slept on the sofa, so I could 'have a lay in' which really translates to- stayed up all night gaming. I tried to let is all go over my head, tried to keep it all together but I can't help but cry, I feel so lonely and feel so selfish spilling my guts out on the Internet but I don't have anyone else.
