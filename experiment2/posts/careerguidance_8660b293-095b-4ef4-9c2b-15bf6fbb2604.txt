First-ever performance review, how to negotiate raise during a promotion?
I am having my first-ever performance review on Friday.   I had a job many years ago that I was at for 2 years and didn't have a performance review.  After that, I went freelance for nearly a decade and now I am working full time.  This company brought me in under my usual title because of covid and is paying me substantially below what I had been making.    

They mentioned that I'd be getting a promotion at my review. I've done some research and talked to some people who used to work for my company but have moved on to do the same roles at competitors. It seems that the problem with the company I'm working at now tends to underpay the market rate for my position.  

Does anybody have any advice on how to negotiate an increase in salary?   I want to stay with this company since I like my co-workers and we are not going to be going back to the office, so I'm ok not getting the market rate, but I'd like to negotiate closer to it.
