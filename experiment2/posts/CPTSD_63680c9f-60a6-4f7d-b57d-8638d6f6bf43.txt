I was today years old when I learned the Domestic Violence hotline “The Hotline” (USA) only helps those persons in “intimate partner relationships.”
Abused by your boss, a roommate, neighbor or anyone you were not considered to be in an “intimate partner relationship?” 

Beaten to a pulp, thrown out like trash or hit by someone who is not a current/former romantic partner? 

You’re out of luck.
