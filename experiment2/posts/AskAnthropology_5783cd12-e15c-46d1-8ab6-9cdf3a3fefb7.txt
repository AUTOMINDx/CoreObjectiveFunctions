Established prehistoric cultural groups?
Hey!

So I know that Indo-Europeans, and Bantu have kind of loose cultural beliefs and norms that I guess get correlated with their linguistic groups. Is this the case with other prehistoric groups? I couldn't really find much on like "afro-asiatic" or "sino-Tibetan" culture or anything. Thanks!
