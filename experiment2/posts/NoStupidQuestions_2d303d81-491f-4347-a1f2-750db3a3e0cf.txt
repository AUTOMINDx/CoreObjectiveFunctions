Is everyone just constantly fucking?
Back in ye olden dayes of [Cracked.com](https://Cracked.com) they ran a "Personal Experience" section where they interviewed people about their real-life occupations and experiences.  One common theme among all the articles (so much that it became something of a trope) is that everyone is constantly fucking.

I've worked for homebuilders where site superintendents would take their wives, girlfriends, or mistresses to unfinished homes to bang.  I've worked in a hospital where a coworker claimed to have taken several partners to the lowest landing in the stairwell to pip-pip the diddly doo.  I've worked in hotels where the front desk staff claimed to have gotten jiggy with the management...others where management screwed guests.

Even broader-scope than that, there was the whole Ashley Madison scandal, where names were leaked from \*just one site\* that seemed to indicate that tons of sex was being had in all walks of life.

Given all this...is everyone just constantly fucking, or are they all just lying?
