Is it wrong of me to consider myself Native American, when I've never been a part of that culture?
*I promise this isn't a soapbox lmao, I've just never been able to ask anyone this before because of my family...*

For back story, my grandmother on my fathers side is 100% Native, and my grandmother on my mothers side is 50% Native (both from different tribes/areas). The only issue, is that both sides of the family "denounced" their cultures/ethnicities because of the Mormon church and or fear of persecution. I've always been interested in learning more about my ancestry and my past, but my family is too racist and too far in their ways to even consider looking at their past. They got rid of anything that had to do with their family history involving their Indigenous side, and it makes me sad. I feel wrong claiming that I'm Native American, because everyone else in my family refuses to accept it (I found out through my grandpa on my dads side, and my grandma on my moms side will "admit" that she is native, but doesn't know anything about her culture due to her mother not being a "big" part of it).

I think another part of it is that my great grandmother on my moms side ran away because of persecution in the 1920/30s, and I personally believe she didn't want to be "known" as native, and so she taught her children (my grandma) the same thing.

THE other thing is, I present as "white" a lot more than I used to, mostly because I don't go outside anymore. I used to be insanely tan/dark as a kid, and my dad is still super tan/dark. I feel almost *wrong* claiming that I'm Native American, when I have no ties to that culture. I honestly don't even know what tribes they were apart of, other than that my grandmother (dads side) was in the Black Hills/Badlands of South Dakota.

**TLDR//** Should I feel guilty for claiming to be Native American when it's a big chunk of my ancestry, because I technically know nothing about the culture (even though I want to know everything about the culture). I'm afraid to try and learn more, because I'm not sure how I'd be able to prove that I'm native considering there isn't very much documentation, other than by the way I look and my family looks, and by misc family stories that weren't thrown away/forgotten.
