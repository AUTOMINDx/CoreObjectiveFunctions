Long weekend help
I've had some good recovery. I was able to go out more it's weird that I can go to many places in the Bronx with little trouble but the moment I go to Manhattan I start having horrible anxiety and need safety nets. With the long weekend I was indoors every day. I had no money to spend and I didn't want to be out in the cold. It has been an average low 30 °F - high 40 °F here. I am trying to go out to get my vitamins and my body is shaking with anxiety. My calming techniques are not working. I feel like I'm struggling walking down 3 flights of stairs. Like wading through mud. Turning around to go back up and it disappears. I don't want to go back to how I was. Scared of everything. I want normal fears like being late or with everyone seeing you in underpants, but you tell them to see more visit your only fans so it's not as embarrassing
