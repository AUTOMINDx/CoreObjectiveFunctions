Is this anxiety or GERD?
Male 18yo

I have previously suffered from a long line of diseases starting from a nasty toothache (root canal involved), acid reflux and pelvic floor dysfunction. A week ago when I thought i was finally coning off of a long disease streak, my anxiety/acid reflux struck in again. I was experiencing brain fogginess (forgetfulness), nasty indigestion episodes, pelvic pain, panic attacks and dizziness. The symptoms were especially worst after meals and when I think about negative thoughts. My question is, is the root of these symptoms because of my acid reflux? Or my anxiety in general? If yes, what treatment methods would you recommend?
