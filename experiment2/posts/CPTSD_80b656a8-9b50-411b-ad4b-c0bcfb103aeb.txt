I feel like my trauma doesn’t count as much as everyone else’s
I devalue myself and feel that I’m not allowed to be sad because the type of abuse I endured for 15 years was mostly emotional and verbal abuse. I feel like people who endure more physical abuse are way above me and that I shouldn’t be able to feel so wrecked and fucked up from my trauma because no one ever really hit me. Does that make sense? 
i don’t think I have typical flashbacks, every day I just have at least 1 memory of a fight or things my dad said to me or random moments or events. Sometimes the same one sometimes different ones, sometimes I even find myself thinking to remember certain memories. 

I guess this is just kind of a vent because I don’t know where I belong
