AITA for not giving up my seat so a couple could sit together
I was recently widowed and it was my first trip away on my own.  I decided to go to a flower show and booked a seat on a tour bus day trip to view the winning Gardens.  I knew the bus was fully booked so I knew I would need to sit next to someone I didn’t know.  As I sometimes get motion sickness I arrived early to get on the bus so I could choose a window seat which gave me a good view.  The bus filled and when the last two people, a couple, got on, they looked around the bus for two spare seats and when they discovered there were only two single seats left on the bus they approached me and asked if I would move so that they could sit together.  My response was that I would only move if I had a window seat.  I didn’t mention my motion sickness - I felt quite fragile as I was now travelling alone.  They gave me filthy looks and then approached the only other single lady who agreed to give up her seat and move next to me.  I felt uncomfortable throughout the trip whenever I passed them getting on and off the bus and couldn’t really tell what the other passages who heard the exchange thought, but no one spoke to me throughout the day.  Should I have just given up my seat to avoid this tense situation?  I’m sure it will happen again.  FYI- I am an Australian.
