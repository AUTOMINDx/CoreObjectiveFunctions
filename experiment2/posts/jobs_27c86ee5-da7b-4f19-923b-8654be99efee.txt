decent jobs that don’t deal with customers?
most of my jobs have been retail or food service and i am so incredibly tired of dealing with entitled assholes who talk down to me and make me cry. i just started a job at a credit union as a teller and i thought it might be worth it seeing how the pay was the minimum i was asking for and it’s full time with benefits, but… dealing with these people is just not worth it to me. and apparently it’s only going to get worse going into christmas season.  

anyone know any decent jobs that don’t deal with customer service and don’t require a degree? i was thinking maybe looking into a government job but i don’t know if that would be any better. i’m desperate here lol.

edit: thanks for the responses everybody! hopefully i find something suitable enough for me one day lol.
