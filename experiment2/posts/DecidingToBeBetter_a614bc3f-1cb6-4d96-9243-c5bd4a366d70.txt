It's been months since I don't look for validation from guys. But then my ex's birthday is coming, and I sort of wanna do it again.
I dont really understand why. But I just cant help but to feel bitter and I wanna prove him wrong. By having lots of guys chasing after me.
I wanna be self sufficient and validate my existence even without outside source of validation. I also feel that I have a strong ego that I just have to be better than him in all aspects.

I wish for advice. I don't know what to do honestly.
