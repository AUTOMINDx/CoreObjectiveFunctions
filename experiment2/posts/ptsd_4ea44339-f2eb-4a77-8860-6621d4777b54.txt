I lost everything in a fire in 2016. Had a second fire in 2017. Got mostly past the nightmares, but maintained a fear of fire and the smell of smoke. Now, since October 30th, there have been 3 total-loss house fires within 2 blocks of my house. One is currently blazing outside my kitchen window.
People say my fear of fire and the hypervigilance I get at the first whiff of smoke are "irrational".

How does one get through PTSD when the danger is still so very real?

One way I've been working on it is by putting myself in a position where I can actually *do something about it*. It's helped some, but not completely. 

I'm not irrational. This is a genuine danger that I feel like I'm constantly surrounded by. All it takes is a local lowlife chucking Molotovs (fire 1, which I responded to), something electrical happening in the kitchen (fire 2, which I responded to). Not sure what's started fire 3. Maybe it's a Christmas tree/light situation, maybe it's electrical, maybe it's something else. I'll find out tomorrow since I'm not on call tonight. 

But I feel like I'm living in a house that's just *waiting* for me to turn my back for a second so it can go up in blazes.
