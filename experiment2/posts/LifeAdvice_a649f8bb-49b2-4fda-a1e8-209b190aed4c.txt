People tend to leave me pretty soon.
Be it friends or girlfriends. People tend to leave me after a certain point after they’ve known me. I feel like I am never taken seriously. I don’t know If it is something I consciously or subconsciously do that drives them away. I now live in a different country and with almost no friends. I can’t talk to new people soon enough here because I feel I don’t have anything in common with them. I really wish change and improve my personality but don’t know what and how to do that !
