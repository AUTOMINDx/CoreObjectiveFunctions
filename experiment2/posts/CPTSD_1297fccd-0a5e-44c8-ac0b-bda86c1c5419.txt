At 25, today i understood why i am a vegetarian
I was watching a movie (Maudie,2016)  where she takes a chicken to cut it to make a dish. I just felt an overwhelming desire to save it and I coudnt understand why. This has always been the case for me since i was very young , to save people/animals from their helplessness.

And then it dawned on me...i project myself into those helpless situations where nobody saved me.  So i see myself as those helpless creatures/people as my younger self and try to save myself.

Well, one more symptom solved today. Hows your day?
