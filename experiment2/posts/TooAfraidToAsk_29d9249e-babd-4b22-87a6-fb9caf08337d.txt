What should I do?
Dear fellow users of Reddit today my manager asked me to come in to work today at 1pm but I said I wouldn't be able to go since I have an appointment. He then asked me to come in on Thursday even though I have 4 days off from work. I understand that he said that our schedules are subject to change and that I have open availability but I did tell him face to face with another there  coworker that I wouldn't be able to have any more open availability once it's December since I wanted to take a class that I've been wanting to take. What should I do?
