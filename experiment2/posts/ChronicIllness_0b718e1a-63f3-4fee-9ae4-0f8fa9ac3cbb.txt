For those looking for flexible WFH options
Hi everyone! I responded to a comment the other day where OP was curious what everyone did for work if they were able. 

I told her I follow someone on TikTok that shares flexible WFH opportunities. Her username is msali_

I hope this helps. She often shares non-phone jobs so itâ€™s really helpful and a lot of them are not full-time.
