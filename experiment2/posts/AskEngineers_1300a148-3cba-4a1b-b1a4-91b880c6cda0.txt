How can I finding Electrical Engineering related jobs in London?
I'm new in London and don't know anyone or anything. Came from Italy with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. Looking for a job or internship in London. 

Freshly graduated but I don't know how things work here nor companies names. Basically no experience in working in Engineering field. 
Actually never properly looked for a job, just studied my whole life :/

Also trying to apply for a Master Degree in the same field. I know i have to attend some English exams like IELTS or TOEFL but daamn you guys have some expensive universities here. How does those spicy loans work?

thanks for any piece of advice!
