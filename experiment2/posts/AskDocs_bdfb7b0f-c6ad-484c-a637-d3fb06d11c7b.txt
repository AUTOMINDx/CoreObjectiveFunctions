Thin female, but potential hypothyroidism?
I’m a female that is 5’5 and 105lbs. I was told I have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism, except weight gain. I’ve always had issues putting on weight and I’m fairly athletic on top of that. 

Is this even possible? I always assumed that weight gain was one of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism. 

Thank you for your responses. I’m baffled, but did not want to appear as though I was second guessing my physician.
