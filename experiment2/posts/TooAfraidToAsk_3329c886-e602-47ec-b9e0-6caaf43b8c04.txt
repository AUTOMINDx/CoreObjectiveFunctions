How do I deal with kinks and fantasies my SO is not into?
I (27m) have been with my SO (27f) for over 8 years now and overall we have an amazing relationship that includes great intimacy. An issue I have been struggling with since the beginning, however, is that her sexual desires are much more vanilla than mine. I would love to experiment with with various kinks and toys including vibrators, bondage, cuffs, or perhaps anal play (not all at once obviously, but even to begin looking into baby steps towards any of those). 

We have discussed this many times before but she’s not open to the idea of giving into any of them.  She seems extremely uncomfortable with any of those things in the bedroom, which I respect without pushing the matter too far. For years I have been trying to essentially just suppress those thoughts because all things considered our relationship is really special in every other way. 

Those fantasies keep bubbling up every now and then through wet dreams or just uncontrollable imagination when I zone out during the day. I don’t watch a whole lot of porn, so these fantasies seem to really come from some innate desire I’ve had since my teenage years. There are days when this really drives me crazy though, and I’m afraid that living with this unresolved issue for several more decades might throw me into a dark and horrible midlife crisis when I’m older. 

Is anyone else struggling with this or am I some rare kind of closeted sexual deviant? What should I do?
