Sometimes I want out of this family
Anyone ever watch the series Brothers &amp; Sisters? That’s literally my mom’s side of the family, except everyone’s not so quick to make up &amp; forgive. 

There’s so much gossip, drama, lies. I found out the hard way that if you tell one family member something in confidence, not only does everyone find out but it’s completely distorted by the time it get backs to me. There’s no *respected* boundaries or it will only last a month at most. Just seems there’s negative energy when I’m around them which then causes my anxiety that’s already bad, to get sooo much worse. 

I want my daughter to still see her cousins, (I’m really close to my brother) but I often question my relationship with my family, especially my mother. Of course all the aunts &amp; uncles, grandparents are extremely nice &amp; loving to the kids (all under age of 7) but to each other, not always so much.

I could tell stories about my family, the things I’ve gone through but always felt people would never believe it. Apparently the writers of that series either went through it as well or imagined the craziest situations (which aren’t considered crazy at all compared to my family). Either way, it’s exhausting, overwhelming &amp; sometimes I just want to go NC.

I have no idea if that’s a normal feeling, but situations definitely don’t end like they do on tv….
