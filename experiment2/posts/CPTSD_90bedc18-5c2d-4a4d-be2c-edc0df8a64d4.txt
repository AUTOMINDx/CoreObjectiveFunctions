Therapy hotlines I can call that AREN'T the national suicide hotline?
I'm trying to find a new therapist that I can contact when I'm feeling awful. I don't have one yet. Is there a hotline I can call to talk to a therapist? Anything for people with trauma specifically? I'm not particularly suicidal right now, plus the suicide hotline responders aren't always trauma informed unfortunately.
