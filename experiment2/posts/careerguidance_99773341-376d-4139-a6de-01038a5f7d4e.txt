I hate my job but the pay &amp; benefits are hard to match so I feel stuck and depressed. What can someone who went to school for accounting pivot into?
So yeah, I went to school for accounting (only a 2 year college diploma program), graduated with honors, and got a job at a really good company. The pay is pretty good, the benefits are amazing, almost everyone is super nice, but my position SUCKS. It's horrible, every day I am just so mentally exhausted and depressed from my work it's unreal.

I know I went to school for accounting but I do not like accounting, I just wanted to get some schooling done in something stable and reliable. And now I am kind of regretting not taking my time to choose something I actually like.

What can someone with some accounting schooling and experience switch to in terms of alternate jobs/careers?
