First date tomorrow and my body confidence has disappeared - any tips to bring it back or fake it for the date?
I’ve [26F] been talking to this guy [30M] for a few weeks, had some video calls, and finally we’re meeting tomorrow for an in person date. 

Unfortunately, at the same time, my mental health has dipped. I’m right at the tipping point of a depressive episode and my normally average/high body confidence has been destroyed. I hate how I feel, I hate how I look, and it’s making me extra nervous about the date tomorrow. 

I’m seeing him in literally 12 hours - does anyone have tips for how to either quickly boost my confidence or at least pretend to myself/him so I don’t have panic attacks getting ready? 

I  don’t want to specifically say “I worry you’ll find me ugly” but I have told him I’m not feeling good in myself. He’s been really kind and complimentary in response and that’s somehow making it worse! 

TL;DR: depressive episode before first date has hurt my body image/confidence and now I’m really anxious. How to boost myself up in a short period?
