Getting the third Moderna but I am also in the middle of rabies vaccinations?
When should I go get my third booster? 26F, 5'1" 125lbs, no chronic health issues, no meds, Midwest USA. I work at a vet hospital and am in the middle of a rabies vaccine series 2/3. Just for prevention, not for post-exposure. Third shot will be 12/7. 

I got my final Moderna shot 4/30. Should I wait until I'm done with my rabies series? How long should I wait?
