The worst kind of loneliness is when your surrounded by people.
I’m 25, and my entire life I’ve never completely fit in with anyone. I’ve had friends and acquaintances, sure, but never someone I’ve been on the complete same page with. I’m married, but my husband makes me feel more lonely than anyone. I don’t have anyone to confide in. I don’t know why I am the way I am or why people tend to not want to stick around to get to know me on a deeper level, but its horrible and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.
