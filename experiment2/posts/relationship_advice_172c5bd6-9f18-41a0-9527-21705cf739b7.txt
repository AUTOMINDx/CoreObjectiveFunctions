My (29m) girlfriend (24f) is ruining our relationship with her insecurities
Hey everyone, just wanted to reach out on a anonymous account, me and this girl have been together for 4 years and recently bought a house together but it feels like I'm walking on eggshells every day of my life, needing some advice on how to continue forward

Let me start by saying that if we're alone she's typically a amazing woman, she's also a incredible step mom to my daughter, but when we venture out into the world she's constantly arguing with me, examples like

*Doesn't want me to have any female friends/talk to woman

*Wants access to all my passwords, stalks my history, my YouTube history etc, my Facebook history from years ago

*Will try to hide my eyes or wants me to look away when ever slight nudity appears on the tv, once got mad because I saw a nude statue at a restaurant

*Accuses me of cheating on her for accidentally looking at a NSFW image (hadn't been flagged yet) maintains that I cheated on her to this day

*Ive done BJJ for years, she began coming along, and has issues if I have a female partner, she is allowed to have male partners

*Once got mad because I shared a girl's post on Facebook about her missing dog

It all came to a head when our mail lady (whom I used to ride the bus with in school) dropped a package off and I asked her how she and her husband are doing (I know them both)

She got angry that I "just had" to talk to her, and I should have just ignored her and let her get it. She maintains that she "just gets bad vibes" from this girl, however she has no valid reason besides me introducing her to them at Walmart once passing by

She then manipulated the matter by telling her sister that I had a "relationship" with her, (leading her to believe we once was a couple) to get her on her side

The next day I injured my back at work (very physical job) and she said it was karma for talking to the mail lady and breaking a "trust barrier" we had set up, I told her that was a slimey comment, and now we are talking about going our separate ways, she maintains I don't "respect her boundaries" and I lie, and cheated on her

Is there any hope in salvaging this? Am I crazy for wanting to? We just bought a house and my daughter adores her, Id hate to throw 4 years away but I can't live like this, we've been to a relationship counselor already, and when she began to take my side in the situation my girlfriend decided she didn't "want to spend the money" anymore
