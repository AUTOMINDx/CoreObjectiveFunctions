Food feeling stuck in throat all day
For those that have the feeling of food stuck in the throat:,
1) did it come on suddenly? This literally started for me three weeks ago one night and now it happens every single time I eatâ€¦.and lasts for hours
2) did you find the cause and were you able to treat it successfully?

Really feeling worried :(
