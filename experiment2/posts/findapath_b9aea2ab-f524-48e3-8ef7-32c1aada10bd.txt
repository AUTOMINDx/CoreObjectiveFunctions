Should I quit or stay at my current job?
I'm (22). Heavily considering my life's choices.

I'm working in customer service. The company is great as well as the people. They even extended my contract (my position is just casual, contract). I tried applying for an internal position, but I wasn't considered for it as I lack experience. 

Should I find another job that allows me to grow? Or should I stay with this company, wait for /i/ another /i/ months of who knows how long to get promoted? My fear is burning bridges and not being looked as grateful as this company has been good to me (extended my contract, people are amazing, gave me tons of hours). I've asked my supervisor if I'll have a career plan, but they have to see if I'll be in it for the long term. 

My gut is telling me to apply for a different job at a different location. This place doesn't have a lot of opportunities.  I'm heavily leaning at it. I fear that I'll just be stuck in this position and not grow. Plus the more I stay in customer service, the more I hate it. People yelling at you for something you didn't do; being discriminates etc. 

Any advice to whack some sense in me? 

I've been here less than a year. 7 months.
