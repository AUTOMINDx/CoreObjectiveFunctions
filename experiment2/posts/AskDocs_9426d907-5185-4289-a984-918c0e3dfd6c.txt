I am at my wits end - bitter taste in mouth 24/7
22f non smoker but snug user

plz help 

i literally have the WORST thing going on, it’s making me depressed.
I had a cold where i couldn’t taste or smell anything for a couple days, but when i got better and started tasting again my whole mouth is bitter!! my saliva is bitter, my food, the air!

It is so bitter i can’t swallow my saliva, i can’t drink as glass of water and i can’t eat, i seriously can’t be in my body rn, the taste is haunting me 24/7 and it feels toxic/not right.

I read that it can happen when ur mouth dries up from a stuffed nose and i had that, but wouldn’t my taste be better since i’ve been nose breathing again.

Also read it can be thrush, but i don’t have any white spots or anything my mouth looks normal.. but i’m getting a test scrape done.

the taste seems worse at the front of my tongue and top of my mouth and it’s not a bad taste from the tonsils or post nasal drip, also sweet stuff seems more bitter.

i have tried brushing my tongue, salt water gurgle, baking soda gurgle and anti bacterial gurgle, no relief.

Is this my life now?? if so i can’t deal, i’m very sad.
