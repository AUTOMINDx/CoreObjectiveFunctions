Hey men, when you're singing along to a song and a woman's part is playing (a full song or part of a duet), do you make your voice falsetto or do you keep your normal singing voice?
I absolutely love duets, if it's a man/woman or both singers are the same gender. So if you could also post your favorite duets that would be great.
