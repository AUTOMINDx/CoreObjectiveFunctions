[StarWars] Are both sith and jedi actually wrong? And was Anakins destiny actually meant to become much greater then any sith or jedi?
There is that one star wars the clone wars episode(S3E16) where Anakin, Asokha and Obi are somehow trapped on a mysterious planet.

It seems that this place is an amplifier of the force and it hosts 3 entities. The Father, the daugther and the son. The daugther repesents the light side and the son the dark side in all extremes.

But the father represents the balance between these two. He doesnt show any affliction for either side and loves and accepts them both.

Also it seems that he is much much stronger then both of his children. And that makes alot of sense.

The jedi and sith are both extremes of the force. So it makes alot of sense that there is also a middle ground between both of them.

The father says he is growing weeker and wants Anakin to take his place because its his destiny. Anakin refused and leaves and well we all know how this ends.

BUT. It does show me that the strongest force wielder would actually be the ones that master the force but dont choose between a side but rather accept them both but rejects the doctrines of the jedi and sith order.
