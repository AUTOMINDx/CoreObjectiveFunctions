What developments were required for the supermarket to come into existence?
Or, more provocatively, "why weren't there supermarkets in 0 AD?" (Or 1000 AD, or 1500 AD...)

Supermarkets didn't exist (some brief wikipediaing tells me) before the 20th century, and before that the place where you bought goods tended to be quite different - more personal, with more individual places to visit. However, their economies of scale give an advantage, so what obstacles were there to realising those economies of scale before the 20th century, be they technological, cultural, economic or something else?
