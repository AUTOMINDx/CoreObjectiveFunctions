confused and angry
What would your think or do if your T said at the very end of the session, I hope you don't find out how to feel your emotions anytime soon, I need you. I have always had trouble expressing emotions about myself due to to how I was raised. It wasn't allowed in my home growing up. What could he possibly need me for except a payday. This leaves me feeling angry and used. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
