eyes hurt
With nightmares, I clench my jaw at night. Sometimes to a point it breaks my teeth. Had to extract two morals.

But also, I develop traumatic glaucoma like condition in the eyes when eyes hurt, sensetive to light and just very painful. Eye doctor took a picture and said that it does look like glaucoma but, after I have better sleep, it disappears for a while.

Have you ever experienced anything like that? My GP and eye doctor mostly shrug to this issue and any potential solutions, while recognizing it.
