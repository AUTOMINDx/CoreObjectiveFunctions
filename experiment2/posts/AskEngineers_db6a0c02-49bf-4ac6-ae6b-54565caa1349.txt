What's the largest pay cut you've voluntarily taken?
I'm starting the long task of applying for fed jobs.  I don't have my PE yet, so I'd be starting off on the lower end.  I'm probably looking at a minimum of 20% pay cut as a trade for better quality of life.  That's a pretty big lump.

Anyone here regret it?
