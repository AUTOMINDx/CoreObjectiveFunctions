[Black Mirror: White Christmas] Why are they doing the whole cookie servant thing?
So, you make a copy of a mind, you torture that mind until it completely breaks and will do anything you say, and then you enslave that mind. Ok! Cool.

Why not just make an AI?

We can already make AIs that can figure out people's preferences, and we're nowhere near the level of making cookies. I feel anyone who can run a fully sentient human mind on a thing the size of a coffee bean can pretty easily make an machine that can learn someone's personal routine over a few weeks. Indeed, we've seen AIs that would be easily able to do that in the Black Mirror verse, and they don't seem that expensive to make.

You get exactly the same product without having to put the person through surgery, risking the mind being broken (or worse- "pretend to comply and then burn the house down" seems like something someone would attempt once they had control of the house) or facing the possibility of a massive backlash from the whole mass torture thing.

Even if you don't care about the cookie's suffering at all, it just seems like an AI is just objectively better as a choice. Why did we go for the whole "torturing fully sentient clones" rather then just improving an Alexa?
