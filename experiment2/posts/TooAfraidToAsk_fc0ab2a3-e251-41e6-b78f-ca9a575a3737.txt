Is mean/cruel banter normal between friends, family and partners?
I've (F) recently gotten a boyfriend. And, to be honest, I don't have any friends nor have I had many friends throughout my life. I was present in several conversations he's had with his friends and brother, and honestly, they're so mean to each other! 

He's even told me that one of his friends and his girlfriend call each other "bitch" and "small dick" etc etc. Like what?? I'd be so upset if my partner called me names in public!

He says that they're just harmless jokes and nobody takes any of it seriously. Am I just too sensitive or old-fashioned? Or is it actually normal and I should get over myself and start getting used to hearing and saying horrible things as jokes?
