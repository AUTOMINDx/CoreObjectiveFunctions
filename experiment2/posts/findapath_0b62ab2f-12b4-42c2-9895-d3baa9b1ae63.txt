Alternatives to the mortuary field?
Hello, I'm currently a Provisional Funeral Director, who just one month into the field is finding out that this particular job is not for me. I'm currently contemplating a job in Family Service Counseling, but I'm not sure I'm quailified or what is required. However, if there are any other fields I can use my associate in applied science/associate in Arts let me know. I feel currently lost atm, and I'm reaching out to see all the possible options that I have available for me. Any advice is welcome
