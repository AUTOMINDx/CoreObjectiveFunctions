What steps should I take to get experience in Socal now? (M; mid 20s)
I'm  working on my Physics degree (specializing in computational physics). I Only have an Associates degree in Math/science and Social sciences at the moment. What jobs can I apply to, to get my foot in the door? I know data analyst, IT, and mechanical engineering require a good amount of skill right out the bat but I'm still a rookie that can't compete. I've only worked in warehouse and customer service/retail. 

So I need something that can give me relative experience in the STEM field and build my portfolio by the time I graduate (in 2 years).

I know  entry level C programming, R, excel, and some basic python and java. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.
