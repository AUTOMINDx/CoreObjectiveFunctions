Are there any autobiographies of happy aristocratic childhoods (Britain - 1800s)?
In "Monarch Of The Glen", I believe I recall the lairds had a family tradition they performed at the loch (to pass on the title?). Are rituals like that complete fiction? I've scoured archive.org and can't find a single autobiography that is not either a tale of parental neglect (like Churchill, Curzon), or a trip straight to public school.

Thanks for any book/journal recommendations!
