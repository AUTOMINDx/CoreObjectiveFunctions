This is how it looked last year.

I'm a 36 African American female.  Im 5'3 and I weigh 217 lbs. I  take metformin, omneprazol, lisinprol. I do not smoke anything. I drink  occasionally.

It itches . I actually noticed it because I scratched it and it was extremely painful.

It didn't use to itch nor look this way? 

If not skin cancer what could it be?
