Has anyone served in the military as an engineer?
I currently work for a defense contractor as a mechanical engineer and I’ve been considering joining the AF reserves.

From what I’ve heard the engineering positions in the military are not actually engineering, but more so management. I’m fine with this but has anyone found the reserves to be a good complement to their main career? While I want to join I will have to pause my career for several months for training and want to make sure I’m not taking steps backward. 

Appreciate any insight, thanks!
