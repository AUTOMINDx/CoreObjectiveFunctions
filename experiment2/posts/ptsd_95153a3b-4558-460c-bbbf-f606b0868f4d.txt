Would you call this PTSD?
In April of this year I got a knock at the door which no one wants. It was about 5am. I open the door and 3 cops are stood there. They’re here to tell me that my mother has died. She was the only family I had left, dad disappeared when I was an infant and mom had no siblings and her parents passed away when I was a young kid. Recently, last 2 months or so, I keep having this thing happen almost every single night. I’ll wake up early hours of the morning to the sound of someone knocking my door. At first I used to check if anyone was there and there never was. Now I don’t bother, I just stay awake for a minute or two to see if it knocks again but most time I just fall back asleep. The whole phenomenon seemed to coincide with the fact my friends all slowly stopped talking to me. Around about the time it started up, the last of my friends was slowly backing away - not reply to messages, whenever I called him it would go straight to voicemail (but if I used no caller ID he would answer and usually say “oh let me call you back I’m just in the middle of something.”) anyway long story short most of them have blocked me but no one replies or if they do it’s usually about 3 or 4 days after I message them and they’ll just reply something like “sorry been busy”, “sorry forgot to reply to this”.

Any ideas people? Appreciate it.
