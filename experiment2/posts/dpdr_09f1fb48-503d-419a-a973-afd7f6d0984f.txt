Meds
I'll be seeing a psychiatrist for the first time next week and I was wondering if it's hard to get something like Klonopin prescribed. My dpdr is chronic 24/7, drug induced and I recently lost my cat which has made my dpdr much worse. Gotten to the point where it's hard to function and get out of the house. I need something to atleast get me through for now and I've read a lot about benzos being a good "band aid" for people. I understand benzos can be tough to get but im curious if a psychiatrist will be willing to prescribe it. And if not klonopin, what meds do you guys think I should try? I'm nervous to take SSRIs because my dpdr is already pretty bad and I don't want to risk it getting worse right now.
