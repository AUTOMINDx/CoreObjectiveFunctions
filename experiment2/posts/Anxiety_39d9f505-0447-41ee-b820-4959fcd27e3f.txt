Anxiety after social situations
I usually avoid so many things because of my anxiety, but sometimes when I get invited to some event and don't go, depression kicks in later. So this Saturday I decided to go along, despite feeling like a mess. 

Saturday was pretty fun for me, went to a local tattoo convention, met some cool people, saw some nice art. It was really a fun, decent day.

But now, because of it, my anxiety has only gotten worse. These past two days have been hell. I want to delete my socials again. I'm constantly overanalyzing if i said or did something wrong, questioning if I behaved "off", worrying about how people perceived me. I really know that I shouldn't be doing this, but it really IS out of my control. These past two days are really tough on me... I'm on a verge of crying once again.

I'm just looking for comfort on here. How do you guys deal with similar situations? How can I help myself? This has been my life for a looong time, but it's only getting worse and I'm running out of tools to help myself.
