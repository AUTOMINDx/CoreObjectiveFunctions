Severe anxiety from omeprazole
I've been on omepraxole for about a year.  The last 6 months I slowly tapered down to 10mg and I've held at that dose for a few months.  Now I'm getting extreme anxiety from it.  I was using zegerid.  It's a non delayed release form of omeprazole.  Was weighing my dose on a scale.  I have severe anxiety, trembling, internal vibrations.  I'm not sure If I'm withdrawal or the med is doing this.  I slow tapered over 6 months down to 10mg
