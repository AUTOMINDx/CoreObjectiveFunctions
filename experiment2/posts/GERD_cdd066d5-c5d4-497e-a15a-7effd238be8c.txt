Teeccino flavor recommendations
If you drink Teeccino, which flavor do you like, and for comparison, how did you used to take your coffee/tea? I want to buy some, but can’t decide which flavor.

Well…. Honestly, I really wanted the French Roast, but health anxiety wants me to stay away from ramón seeds (never had it before), so I’d like to hear about the other flavors.
