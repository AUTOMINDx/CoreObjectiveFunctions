Balancing Emotion and Reason
As a student of philosophy, I struggle with balancing the emotional and the rational. For instance, I sometimes have an emotion-driven desire to pretend that rational thought does not exist and simply live a life that is romanticized, so to speak. On the other hand, I feel that I am too analytical to NOT consider the rational, which in turn leads to the cycle of questioning lifeâ€™s meaning. 

I am curious what texts exist on this topic, the dichotomy of the emotional and rational. How do philosophers suggest we navigate this, and are there arguments that suggest one is more important than the other?
