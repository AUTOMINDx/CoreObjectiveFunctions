Is it just humans that "crack" their joints?
Laying here I just cracked my neck, and my cat gave me a look that I'm taking to be disgust. Now this is pretty standard for my cat but it got me thinking, "I've never heard my cat click a joint".
So, my question is, do they? Do any animals click their joints? A brief Google search got me nothing so I'm turning to reddit. Appreciate any and all answers.

Thank you.
