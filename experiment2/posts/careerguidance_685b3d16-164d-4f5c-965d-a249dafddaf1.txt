Should I look for a better job?
I'm a high school senior who has been working at a pizza shop for a few months. The environment is great and I get along with my coworkers. I've progressed quickly and started management training in addition to multiple raises from $7.25 to $9. Despite this, I feel like the quality of work I am providing is far more valuable than what they are paying me. Talking to the other managers they said they've barely gotten raises when they became managers and that training took them 6 months to a year. I don't want to work at $9 an hour for that long, but the opportunity to be a manager would look good on resumes. Should I look for a job that pays more? There are several in my area that pay significantly more ($12-16/hour).

Tldr: Is management experience worth more than better pay?
