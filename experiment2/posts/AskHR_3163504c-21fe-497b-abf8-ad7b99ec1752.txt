Should I go into the bank and introduce myself to the manager after submitting my application? [CAN]
I submitted my application to be a teller through the bank website. I know for the first round going through applications, the branch isnt as involved in the selection process and it's the head corporate HR folks that filter out candidates, do a phone interview, etc.

Is there any merit to going into the bank and introducing myself to the (assistant) managers? My application is currently classified as "under consideration" on the website but I havent yet been contacted by anyone.
