thoughts on authenticity
many people in my life have not been who i thought they were. i don't think they were even who they thought they were. my first love, at age 50, after a 30 year loveless marriage that i was emotionally blackmailed into. that's a whole story. but i have always been who i thought i was, even at my most depraved, i was only looking for love and pleasure, sometimes both, trying to balance this scale that life handed me. my first love, that was a 3 year relationship, that nearly broke my new found confidence. it was that he wasn't who he thought he was. i wondered how i could even trust myself to know who people were. i've hidden most of my life, scared and scarred. i'm torn between wanting there to be a solution to how badly some people's hands are dealt, and resigned to the fundamental, designed dysfunction. someone is profiting from our pain. the lack of support and basic healthcare is built in. i wish i could be wide-eyed and hopeful like i once was, even in the midst of unbearable pain, as i was when i was young. i'm a little drunk. the only reason this is being posted. i can't tell just now if it makes sense or has value. i may delete, or leave it as a marker of where i sometimes come to. so, now, if nothing else, i raise my glass, to those of us dealt the worst hands. does anyone else cling to the romantic tragedy of it all?
