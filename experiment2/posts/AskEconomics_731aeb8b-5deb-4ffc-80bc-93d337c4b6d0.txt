What's the relationship between a fiscal budget surplus and the income equilibrium. The same applies to the relationship between the latter and a rise in imports
So I'm doing this practice test and there is a question which states:
"A fiscal budget surplus has, with respect to the evolution of the income equilibrium, the same consequences as:" 
 being the right answer according to the key "a rise in imports"
Now I can't find any correlation between any of them neither in my books nor online, there must be something I'm missing
