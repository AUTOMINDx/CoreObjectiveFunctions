In Rocket Propulsion, is the exhaust velocity relative to the rocket itself?
Hello, 

I have a question about this equation : vf-vi=ve ln (mi/mf) where ve is the exhaust velocity of the fuel. I am wondering if this will be in relation to the rocket? If so, shouldn't it be negative?

Thank you for any help :)

Have a wonderful day
