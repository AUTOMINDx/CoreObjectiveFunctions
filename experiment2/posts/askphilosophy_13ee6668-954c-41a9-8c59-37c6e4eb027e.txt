Is there any work on the concept that ideas are sentient and are super organisms to ourselves?
We are made up of cells and they obey our will, we are the cells of ideas and must first have ideas before we can have action. Ideas fight for mind space in the same way an organism does for resources. An idea without a mind to think it is dead or at least dormant. If the idea of war did not exist then we physically could not commit war.


I haven't run into any works yet beyond basic philosophy of mind type stuff and it's a bit difficult to Google without the key word that likely already exists to explain the concept.
