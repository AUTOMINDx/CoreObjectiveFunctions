AITA for refusing to provide decorations for my niece’s wedding reception?
My niece is getting married in a few days. It’s a destination wedding that none of the family can go to. I just found out that the groom’s parents are planning a reception less than two weeks from today. I have not received an invitation, but my sister did, and she was shocked because the back of the invitation has a list of names and what that person is supposed to provide. 

Under my name (which they have under a last name I haven’t used in 25 years) and my parents’ names, it says we are providing the decorations. No effort was made to contact us and ask if we could do it. We weren’t consulted on the date or time, both of which are extremely inconvenient. My parents are elderly and live 4 hours away, and I am a single mom with a severely autistic teen. I have no one to watch her, so I will only be able to stay for an hour or so since I’ll have to bring her, and it’s an evening event that runs into her bedtime. 

AITA for texting the groom’s mom (like I said, I have not actually received an invite, but even if I had, there’s no RSVP info on it) and telling her that due to the short notice and above mentioned circumstances, my parents and I will not be able to provide the decorations?  My mom and I discussed it, and she is appreciative of me offering to be the one to make the contact. We will attend for my niece’s sake, but we are very unhappy at the assumptions being made, especially since we just found out about it.
