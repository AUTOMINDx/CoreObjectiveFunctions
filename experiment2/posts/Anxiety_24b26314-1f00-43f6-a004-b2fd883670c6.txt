Does anyone deal with dizziness/ felling of unbalance 24/7?
I been dealing with constant anxiety for about two years. I have gotten better but I have this lingering feeling of dizziness and unbalance that won’t budge. I went to an ENT and he told me after multiple tests that my dizziness is not coming from an inner ear problem. After that my mind became even more anxious cuz now I can’t blame my dizziness on vertigo. My hypochondriac self went from thinking it’s just vertigo to I have a brain tumor. Why else would I be dizzy even when I’m not anxious. I also deal with depersonalization and lately my vision has been feeling very funny. Like it feel like my peripheral vision has expanded and I noticed movement really easy. Kinda like looking through a fishbowl. Also kinda some tunnel vision. I have an MRI scheduled for the 7th and I am happy that I could possibly rule out the worst and finally believe that my dizziness is purely psychological but I won’t know until after I guess
