A painful memory resurfaced today. My dad forced me to get laser hair removal on my mustache when I was 12.
That summer, my mom told me "dad is having you get laser hair removal this September". As a child who hit puberty early, I was constantly ashamed of my body and felt disgusting for having body hair. I remember screaming that I wasn't going to go and that my mom was a monster for making me go. I was dragged there against my will, &amp; completed one full treatment (going in once a week for like a month). I had to put numbing cream and plastic wrap over my mustache, and I was forced to sit out in the public lobby like this. People walked in, pointed and laughed or just looked at me in horror. 
When the treatment ended, my dad was outraged that my mustache was still there. Any time I walked into the room with a few stray hairs, he made a gagging noise and said "why didn't the laser hair removal fix that"? My mom said " it takes several rounds of laser hair removal to fully get rid of the hair". 
I am a 33 year old woman with PCOS. I'm hairy. The world can deal with it because I am a person with feelings, not a too-hairy walking fuck hole.
