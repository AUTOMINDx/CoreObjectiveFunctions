just here to rant
Hey, i don't know what to say and where to begin. Honestly, I'm just really sad. I'm trying to force some chemicals in my head for me to be happy. So I go out and workout.

Long story, 2020 was a very difficult year. I went through a very tough breakup where she left me for someone else(she was hiding this), blamed me why we were breaking up, and continuously is playing games. Until now, she is still playing games trying to talk to my friends like they are her friends. I don't know. I'm just frustrated.

I'm seeing a therapist but I feel like I've seen a therapist for so long about this break up that like, I feel it's time for me to start moving on and being independent. I even have a date on Saturday just to see whats out there. But honestly, I don't know where things are going to go. I'm very sad.

So many times today, I feel like crying. Emotionally, I want to cry, but I cant physically cry. I don't know. just hurt.
