DAE worry about being an abuser?
I got married to my husband a right after running away from home.

I catch myself thinking extremely mean stuff whenever he does something that annoys me.

Sometimes when he hurts me without realizing ( like not being as romantic as I want him to be) I catch myself being rude. Telling him how he isn't romantic enough or sweet enough or just how I want more of something in our relationship.

Earlier today I asked him a question and he misunderstood my intention with the question and answered annoyed.

My immediate thought was " I get why divorce rates are so high. Instead of reacting to what I say he reacts to what he thinks I mean"

Well I only said the first part out loud. All he hearf was i understand why divorce rates are high.

I dont know if i unconsciously did it intentiknally to hurt him? I apologized of course and he told me not to worry but seeing him cry bc of something i said Was awful.

Feels like my apologizing and hugging him was love bombing to apologize for abusing him.

Idk whether I am a bad person or just going crazy.

Do you guys ever feel like that?
