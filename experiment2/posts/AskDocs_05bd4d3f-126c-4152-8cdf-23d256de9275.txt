Prescribed Adderall use in the long run scope on considering longevity/lifespan
Good Day Smart Physicians

I am a 32 year old male prescribed 20mg XR Adderall for symptomes of ADHD.

I am having trouble finding good information long term Adderall use. 

It has changed my life because I have built positive routines into my life. I am now very fit and eat a relatively healthy diet oriented towards lowering blood pressure.

These routines are sustainable for me. But I wonder what I am giving up in taking Adderall in the long run and I can't find relevent info.

Will it shorten my life span under prescribed doses? 

My doctor's response was could it be any more worse than having a poor diet or poor regard for fitness would on my lifespan. Basically a picking of the lesser of two evils situation.

What about if a diet and healthy body were already good? What then? Would it be a detriment to longevity?

I am talking about usege in non-abusive prescribed terms and there's just so little on the web available for this.

I also like to read medical papers on this stuff so if you have links to publications I appreciate that in addition to your opinions.
