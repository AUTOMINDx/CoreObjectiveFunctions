[LOTR] Why is 9 people the optimum size for the Fellowship of the Ring?
Why does matching the number of Nazgul make the most sense in terms of fellowship size? I know stealth was the primary concern but wouldn't warriors know from experience what would be the maximum size team that could reliably move quickly and remain stealthy. A larger team would be better able to fight off threats along the way and carry more supplies. A smaller team of maybe 6 people might be better able to avoid spies or not draw attention in general.

Why did no one say "from experience, I believe the optimum team size for this type of mission is X people" when there were many people present at the Council of Elrond who have extensive combat experience in stealthy missions? People like Elrond, Glorfindel, Gimli, Gloin, Legolas, Aragorn, and Boromir.
