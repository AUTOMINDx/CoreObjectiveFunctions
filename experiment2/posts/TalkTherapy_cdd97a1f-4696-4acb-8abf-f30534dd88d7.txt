I hate intake papers. This is legit my feelings, but can I actually say this??
So, I'm starting with a new therapist in a little over a week. I'm going to be getting a form emailed to me to be filled out prior to starting. She's within the same system as my most recent t, my psychiatrist, the locked ward i was in, and in which all my medical health conditions have been addressed. So, she can see my history. But I know one of the questions is what my goal/s for therapy might be. Is, "to learn to be a well- adjusted and happier, healthier, and complete human being," weird? Because like, yeah I have bipolar and ADHD, and also some unresolved childhood trauma that I've never addressed with anyone before. I have all these wonderful (and sometimes diametrically opposing) parts of self - spirituality, intelligence, levity, gravity, caring kindness, softness, strength... but I have a hard time integrating them all into my physical body. I don't want to be "fixed" by my therapist. I want an experienced, uninvolved outside point of view. I want guidance, but not forcibly taken to any conclusions. I don't want a friend, I want a mentor. Show me the way, but don't tell me. Does that make sense?
