Nmom thinks my mourning of my dead cat (day of) is insulting her need of me to be productive on her behalf.
In the midst of leaving to work I notice something on the road and a deep chill ran through me, I hoped I was wrong, but it wasn't the case. My cat was dead. I lost it, I picked him up then and there and took him to our garden, a mess in blood and emotions, I get back inside to get a towel to cover him. Nmom was the first to get up and ask. I could barely get the words the words out but they were understood, then came my sister and she joined in the sorrow. 


About a hour later he was buried. Nmom made food as I showered. I already called in to my temp job and was told if I miss again I'd be fired (fuck'em but w/e). Spent most of the midday just holding my tears and binge watching YouTube to keep my mind off my emotions. 


Then comes Nmom talking up a storm in how the garbage on the truck needs to be tossed TODAY even though the local dump transfer station is opened to locals tomorrow but she'd rather have me do a two hour trip today than wait for a 30 min trip tomorrow. 


For most of the day I've been just empty of emotions but just the tone of her threatening to kick me out because I'm wasting a "day off" has filled me with such pure contempt of her; but in a way I'm in envy of just how she could disregard other people's emotions. 


I wish she had the balls to do it; I'd want to know that she tied to explain her actions to her friends and sisters for their approval over speaker phone as they tried to find a way to stay on her side while calling her out. 

...It has been a rough day.
