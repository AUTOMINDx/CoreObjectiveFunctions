I never say hello to anyone
I never say hello to anyone, if anyone waves or asks me how I’m doing I just don’t respond and ignore them. The most I ever do is nod, and that is only for people I know very well. It’s weird and rude but I just can’t say anything. I go out of my way to avoid people just so I don’t have to have someone say hello to me.
