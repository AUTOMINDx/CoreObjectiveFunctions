Discomfort and annoying bloating
Hi, I am 27 and I am pursuing my higher studies in STEM and for valid reason there is some stress involved in my work. I had digestion related issues since I was a teenager. But, the issues are now to the point that my daily routine is being seriously disrupted.

For instance, I fart more frequently and not only that puts me in embarrassing situation in professional settings, but it is making me more and more annoying to my friends and family; sometimes they are very smelly and sometimes they have sounds. Another big issue is, recently (since around 2018) I have bloating with disgusting sounds that often disgust myself as well. During the worst situation of such stomach related issues, I feel dizzy, irritated, have difficulty focusing and even sometimes feel disoriented. Unfortunately, the issues peak a few times in a month.

I have tried medicine like omeprazole and have consulted a number of gastroenterologist since 2018. Apart from being diagnosed with mild sgpt once in 2019 and treated, I had not been diagnosed with any other disease so far. But, my life has become miserable to the point that I am the only one among my colleagues who show these symptoms and I am being more and more isolated socially and professionally for this reason. Any help to improve my life would be much appreciated.
