Why is anal viewed as negative for men and positive for women in straight relationships?
I feel like there is such a culture of anal being popular when women are receiving, like in porn it seems so prevalent. But it's not viewed the same for men, like in a straight relationship a guy can want anal with his partner but if she wants to do anal with him men are often not into it at all, and it seems they view it as emasculating and painful. 

Isn't the pleasure potential the same (or even greater for men?) and isn't the pain potential the same? I don't understand why there is such a contrast between the way anal is considered between men and women.
