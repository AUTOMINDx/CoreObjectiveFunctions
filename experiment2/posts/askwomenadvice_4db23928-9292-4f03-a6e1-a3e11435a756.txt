24f 34m s**less relationships? I’m in an intimacy deprived partnership
It’s been almost a year since we’ve had sex. 

Not that I haven’t made the attempts; lingerie, romantic date nights, conversations about what I can do to make things how they used to be. I came into this relationship as a single mother navigating life. He came into this relationship as a bachelor; somewhat still navigating life and the ultimate question of ‘what career would suit me for the next 30 years until I retire’. 

Things were very steamy in the beginning, as they usually are. We couldn’t keep our hands off of each other, but life happened. Loved ones lost and tragedies arose. More than we could have ever imagined. Our intimacy began to fade as he began to cope with loss through food, and I coped with tragedies by putting up walls. Regardless of the obstacles we moved in together 8 months into the relationship (I might add that we had been friends for over a year prior). He told me he couldn’t be intimate with me because he was disgusted with his appearance and how much he had let himself go. I love him despite his feelings of his outward appearance. It isn’t just about the s**. I miss having that aspect of intimacy with him. I miss being close to him in that regard. It seems like I’m the villain for voicing those feelings and I don’t want to make any pain he feels about himself worse. I just miss being close to him in that regard. I often think there’s something wrong with me. Maybe he’s biding his time until his fantasies come into fruition. I miss having that aspect of my partner
