I'm losing motivation and don't know what to do
I'm so tired of applying to these shitty retail jobs and not getting a response let alone an interview or an offer. I pretty much live in the middle of nowhere so my options are really limited and I really don't have much motivation to keep looking or try to do anything anymore. I'm 21, all I have is a high school diploma, a security guard license and a few years of work experience. I don't know what to do at this point, I've never been able to move out on my own cause I can't hold down a job long enough to save money. I just see the same shit jobs on the job sites that never respond every day and I'm losing all my motivation to keep trying. Am I alone feeling this? what do I do?
