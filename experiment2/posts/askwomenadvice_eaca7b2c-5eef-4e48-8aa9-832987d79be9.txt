How did you know when you were ready to have sex/How will I know I am ready to have sex?
I (30f) would like to eventually have sex with my boyfriend (29m.) I love him very much, and I know he loves me. He is patient with me in all regards, very caring and generous, and his family loves me.

Like most people, though, he would like to have sex at some point. My problems are somewhat twofold: I have been sexually assaulted multiple times, and my ex pushed me to get through that so I would engage in sexual activities with him. I wanted to, but I knew I wasn't ready - I was doing it because I was afraid of losing him.

All of that has put a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to being sexual. I know I would like to be - I get turned on when we make out, for example - but I know deep down I am not ready to have sex again. I wasn't ready the first time. My boyfriend isn't pressuring me at all - he is very reassuring that, "we'll get there when we get there, when you are ready" - but still. How will I know that I am ready?
