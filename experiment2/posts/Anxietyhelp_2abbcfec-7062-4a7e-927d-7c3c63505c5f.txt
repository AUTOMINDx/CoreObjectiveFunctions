My phobia for choking is seriously affecting my diet
I don't really know what to do, I choked once as a kid and occasionally like now my phobia comes back strong. To the point where I panic everytime I swallow thinking it is going to get stuck.

It's quite exhausting and it makes it so I cannot enjoy food because of it. Which then leads me to losing a lot of weight because I am not eating enough. My only real thing to do during times like this is to eat a lot of soup.

Anyone experience phobias like this and have any of you been able to overcome them? This isnt the sole cause of my anxiety but it is definetly causing me to live a more unhealthy lifestyle.
