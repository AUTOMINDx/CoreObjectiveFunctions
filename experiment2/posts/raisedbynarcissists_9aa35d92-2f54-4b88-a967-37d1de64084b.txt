DAE notice how much more understanding people are towards abuse from narcissistic partners than narcissistic parents?
This is always how it’s been in my experience. 

“Your parents aren’t letting you go out? God how fucking old are you? Really? That age? One would probably think you’re fucking five with how afraid you are of your parents. Just move out.”

Vs. when you say your abusive partner is isolating you and suddenly it’s “abuse victims don’t choose to be in that situation! They need our help and protection! Down with the abusive partner!”

Now don’t get me wrong. It is very much not a competition and both types of abuse are wrong. But the amount of leeway people give to adults being isolated by a narcissistic partner rather than their narcissistic parents really grinds my gears. Has anyone else noticed this?
