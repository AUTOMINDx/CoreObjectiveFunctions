How would you handle the drug dealers next door?
They’re great neighbors.
I don’t care about their dealing, BUT their “visitors” park at my house. 
They will walk out of their building, sit in their guest’s car, or chat out the window for 10 minutes walk, then walk back to their building while the car leaves.
All day and night. I work from home now and watch it. 
Our cameras catch their action all day and blow up my phone with notifications.
I have two young kids and will not have this on their doorstep. 
I don’t want to call the cops.
I want to knock and say do it in your driveway, and off my lawn, BUT I don’t want beef next door.
I just want it off my lawn.
