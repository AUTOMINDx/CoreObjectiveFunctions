Going through that phase of life when you feel completely alone despite being surrounded by people.
It's been almost 3 years since I had any meaningful conversation. Every night feels like eternity. Wish I could scream my hearts out. Would that help? I don't know. I'm losing interest in social life as each day passes. Everything seems so dull and grey.
