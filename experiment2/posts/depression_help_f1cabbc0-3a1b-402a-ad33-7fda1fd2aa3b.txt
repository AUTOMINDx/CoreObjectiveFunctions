Idk what to do anymore
I have been feeling depressed and useless for as long as i know. I have never gone to therapist to diagnose but it’s also hard to do especially if ur parents have bad stigma towards them. I can’t barely do anything. This past year i have been struggling finishing my master which i did finish and now i’m back looking for job. I can’t make myself looking for a job because evertime i will feel like i have nothing i can do. Waking up is a pain because i will remember how useless i am. I can’t talk to my parents or family about it. I barely have any friend to talk about it. Everytime i try to talk about it, my friend would tell me that i’m thinking too much about it and i should lesrn to be happy instead. As if 27 y.o person can be happy as a burden of a family and being told as someone who waste family’s money can be happy. There are times i feel so bad I can’t stop hitting myself. I’ve been eating whatever, taking a shower whenever. Basically i stop caring about myself. I gain so much weight cause i stress eating and never move. I don’t know what to do. I feel people only care about mental health when it’s pretty and quirky not when u are rude, frustrated and on the edge of ur sanity. I mean I understand they probably don’t want to take care of stress out adult. I guess there is no future for me after all.
