Is it okay to get a loan to repay borrowed money from my girlfriend?
Not because she wants it right away, but because I'm feeling tethered, broken, without pwrspecitves and time for myself. When lockdowns struck her savings were the only way of sustenance for us for 3 months. I looked forward to get back to my work, which was really well paid, but there were cuts of stuff, and even now money there is short. I thought I would give the money back in a span of half a year, but here came the blows. She deteriorated to the point where I feel like an empty husk. Biggest problem is that I can't repay her from money I earn now, because all of it goes to food, house supplies, and what hurts most, her snacking. I will be using my own currency which is PLN to draw a sketch. I earn 4k, she has 1,2k, where 2,5k goes for housing, 1k for food, and I need 0,3k for my nicotine addiction. I would have to give her 6,7k to give my IOU. Terms of credit are really good, I can take it on really good terms where I wouldn't feel it. 
Please help me. I feel really broken and dreaded.
With much love friends
