How to deal with not being the most important
i know this is a very stereotypical issue but i was wondering if anyone had any help or tips for it

how do i deal knowing that i can't be the most important to everyones lives im in? i hate that my friends have other friends that they find more important and that im not always on their mind, i can't deal knowing that old friends dont see me as valuable in their lives anymore, i don't want to feel this way cause I know it isnt good for anyone involved but I dont know how to stop the consistent need to want to be number 1 in the people around me's lives, i need people to be obsessed with me
