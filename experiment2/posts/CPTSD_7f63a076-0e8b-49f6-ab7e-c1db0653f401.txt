Anyone else hypervigilant and triggered cos of Omicron variant? I know we don’t know if it’s any more dangerous than other strains. Still, I feel on edge. I had only just begun feeling a little more relaxed when out and about e.g. at supermarket. Now this.
It feels like (potentially) the calm before the storm. Partly it’s like, “Here we go again” and an impending sense of doom... and a sense that this will never be over (I don’t just/necessarily mean the pandemic, as I know intellectually that it will be over at some point). 

Can anyone relate?
