Switching from MEP to sound engineering
Hi all, I currently work as an MEP designer (1 year experience postgrad) and would like to transition to an engineering job that focuses of frequencies, sound, audio, etc. since that was my passion in school and what I excelled at (EE.) I couldn't really find what I wanted to do and needed to take my first internship &amp; job I could find. Are there any software programs, courses, or good paths to get into that type of industry? I would like to gain some experience in my spare time over the course of a year or so to prep myself for interviews. 

An equivalence I am looking for would be to learn Revit/AutoCAD, NEC, IECC, etc. to get into MEP. I should point out I don't want to do construction acoustics. 

Pardon my ignorance on terminologies about the field!
