😐😐😐😐😐
When you're trying to get help re mental illness in a mental illness group to try and figure out why you are unable to handle rejection to an absolutely dysfunctional level (like "ohmygod if I hit another red light I'm ending it all" level), since texting someone ain't an option because you just got dumped by your only friend and the only person you talk to (yes, literally)... And your post gets rejected 😐 

Figured y'all would at least resonate. Being lonely fucking sucks but at least we're alone together, right? 😐 Love y'all. Forreal. I'm lonely tonight cuz I both love things and hate myself so much that I excessively overthink and worry about how to most lovingly smother people out of my life, just like my mother who I fucking hate. So. There's that. 

Happy Monday. Why are you lonely tonight? You're worthy anyways. Wish I could take my own medicine.
