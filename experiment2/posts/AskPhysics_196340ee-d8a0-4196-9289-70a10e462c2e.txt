Would a compressed spring be hotter than an undisturbed one?
I'm thinking that it would be hotter. The wound up spring has potential energy. Therefore, it has more internal energy. Hence, more thermal energy. 

However, I also think that it wouldn't because compressing the spring did not change its kinetic energy, and temperature is the average kinetic energy. 

What's the right way of thinking? I feel like I got my definitions mixed up. 

Side question: Will a spring that was compressed and let go have a higher temperature than an undisturbed one because the first spring had its potential energy converted to kinetic energy?
