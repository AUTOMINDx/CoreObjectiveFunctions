Can anyone recommend a great app/program to help with organization/management?
Long story short, I (28F) was invited back for a second interview at a company I REALLY would love to work at. The interviewer requested on the next interview, I present them with "an idea, either digitalÂ or hard copy, tool or app that you think would be supportive to us should we choose to move forward with you." She stated it can be creative and artsy or functional/technical and the position I am applying for is a personal assistant. I will be thinking about this throughout the next few days so I figured I would get Reddit's input. I appreciate your suggestions!
