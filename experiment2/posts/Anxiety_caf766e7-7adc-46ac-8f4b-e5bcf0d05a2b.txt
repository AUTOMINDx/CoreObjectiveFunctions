I'm fighting the fight and tomorrow will be a big day for me
It's not much but my hands are sweaty and I've had a headache all day, I just can't stop thinking about it: I'll go to the city (to university - haven't had to go there since the 1st semester thanks to corona) and do some important stuff.

I will have to smoke before going on the bus to calm myself down. I'll also listen to music the entire time to distract myself at least a little bit. I've never gone to the city all by myself. I'm soooo damn scared.

Any other tips on calming down? Like... I don't even know if I can sleep tonight, it's so stupid..
