[Warriors] Have the Clans ever recruited or tried to ally with larger, more powerful cat species?
I've only read the first book, and that was a long time ago, but I remember that the Clans seemed to fight each other a lot. So with that much conflict, it seems like each Clan would be interested in getting more powerful fighters. So have any of them ever tried to recruit larger cats like Maine Coons, lynxes, or mountain lions? It seems like those species would be invaluable as heavy units
