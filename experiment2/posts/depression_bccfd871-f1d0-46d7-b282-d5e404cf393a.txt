Need help getting out of this funk
I finally got a new job with better health insurance so I'll be going to therapy soon but until then it's rough for me. The past two weeks I'm in bed all day. The moment I wake up, I wanna go back to sleep. I work in bed, it's just so hard getting out and sitting in my desk. Then when work ends I lay down and nap, maybe eat dinner or shower, then back in bed. Trying to force myself to go outside but it's hard. Also just been eating rice and soup cause nothing is appetizing right now. I'm procrastinating on important things, I have no motivation for some reason. I just wanna be asleep in bed literally all day. I hope I can get some motivation to go on a walk or even the gym soon but it's tough. It's already 10pm I have no idea where the last four hours went. Feels like I've only been in bed 30 minutes
