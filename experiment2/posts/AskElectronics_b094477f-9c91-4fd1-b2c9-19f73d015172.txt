Does a transformer cause phase shift?
The magnetic field generated by the primary coil will be in phase with the input voltage. However, since the induced voltage is related to the rate of change of the magnetic field (which will be shifted by 90 degrees for sine waves), does the output of a transformer exist at a different phase to the input?
