Starting today I will no longer stan Ariana Grande.
Before I start I just want to make it clear that this is NOT a hate post and the reason I’m unstanning is NOT Ariana Grande’s fault, it’s mine. I’m not gonna blame her for why I will no longer support her. Let me explain.

I’ve come to realization that the reason I became a fan of Ariana Grande wasn’t because of her talent or her music, it was because I wanted to be her and I obsessed over how skinny she was.

I developed an eating disorder because I was jealous of how skinny Ariana was and I would put posters of her up in my room as motivation to starve longer.

I would live bicuriously through her, dress like her talk like her etc.

I would look up Ariana’s weight and try to push my self to be skinnier than her. 

Whenever I would try to recover from my disorder when I went on social media and saw Ariana I would immediately go back to starving.

So at this point for the sake of my own mental health I won’t be stanning her as much as I use to. 

I know this is super weird but yeah. It’s for the best because I checked her IG and noticed she’s getting even skinnier which I know will make me want to starve more. It’s best if I just avoid her from now on.
