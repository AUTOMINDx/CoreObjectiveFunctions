Don't know what to say to therapist in first session
Ton of stuff happened in last three years and I thought if I have pure OCD, depression, borderline personality, adhd or something else or I'm just bad at life 

Indecisive with low self esteem and laziness

There's no way I can talk about past in one session, i thought probably i should ask the therapist to do some general mental health test if possible to know if I have some issue or I'm just bad at stuff 


Any suggestions?
