Lost motivation. Can’t bring myself to work.
I’m an artist. I work full-time as artist in a small company but outside of work I just can’t bring myself to even draw a circle! It’s not artist block. I can’t describe it I draw a bit and then go to sleep right after. Most day I’m just “why bother? Why am I even doing this? Who am I doing this for? What am I doing with my life?”. I have little to no fun lifestyle due to where I live. I feel like I’m wasting my life. I barely survive at work. I need to improve my art as my skills are now rusty. I guess I need motivation?
