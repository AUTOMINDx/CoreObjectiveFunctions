I met a girl at a climbing course, but dont know what to do next
I (22M) took a climbing course together with some friends and during the last day, i was paired up with one of the other people (20-25F) taking the course. We climbed together and talked a little. After it was over, one of my friends asked if I had gotten her number, since he thought she was looking at me in a cute way.
I did not have her number, but sent a message to the climbing gym that we were looking to maybe climb again with the people from our course.
She was the only one who responded to that invitation and she sent me a message that she was going to climb again.
Unfortunately, we did not manage to find a time which worked for both of us yet, but we exchanged some messages.
What should I do now? Try to climb together again? Ask her for a coffee date? Keep messaging? Because I suck at text conversations generally.
Pls help :-)
