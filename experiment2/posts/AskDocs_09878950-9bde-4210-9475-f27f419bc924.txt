I can't eat anything anymore and I've lost my appetite
Info: 18F, 5'9, 130lbs (176cm/59kg), white, I don't have any registered medical issues apart from my astigmatism and scoliosis that I've been living with since I've been 6; also I don't drink, smoke, or do any kind of drugs, I've never been chronically ill.

Ever since I lost weight, I've also lost my appetite and desire to eat anything. I hate most of foods I used to love which is really bad considering that I've always been a picky eater. Everything tastes bad, eating basically became a burden for me and not a basic human need. 

I'm not sure what to do, or why is this happening. On top of that I'm always hungry and even when I eat I can't stay full for more than an hour (no matter how much/what I eat). It makes me really sad and I don't know what to do about it. I've tried eating everything I could, but nothing works - I'm still hungry and everything still tastes bad.

Often I'll purposely refuse to eat even when I'm hungry because I don't feel like it or there's nothing that I'd like to eat. My stomach is empty but I have no desire to eat.

I've been working out for more than a year, and I usually have trouble eating enough before as nothing keeps me full through entire workout session. Also, now I'm supposed to gain weight but I just keep losing it.

When I bring myself to eat I feel like I could eat half of the fridge and still not be full. My appetite is really big, that's probably one part of why I'm never full. Why is this happening, can someone please help me understand? I'm desperate and I just want to be able to eat again. :(
