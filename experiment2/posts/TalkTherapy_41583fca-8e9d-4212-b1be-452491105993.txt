Am I overreacting about my therapist’s unavailability?
Hi! I temporarily live in a place where there aren’t many therapists, and I found one that has a similar cultural background and I like her ok. (Though admittedly, sometimes I feel like something is off.)

Anyway, my insurance approved me for twice a week, but at least 50% of the time, she has “family stuff” and can’t see me that often. 

I know that balancing work and a family can be difficult, and maybe she doesn’t have the time, but I also wish she had said something before she continued with me after realizing that I need 2 sessions.

I also don’t want to be needy and not respect her private time or that she deserves pay for her labor. However, times, like today, when I don’t get two sessions, I want a phone check in because I’m panicking about something, but she’s unavailable.

I also have a bad taste in my mouth because months ago when I first became her patient, she ran errands while on two or three remote phone sessions— actual sessions. When I called her on it, she immediately said she wouldn’t do it again, but I’m still bitter about it.

I do want to be respectful and not to entitled. How do I make sense of this?
