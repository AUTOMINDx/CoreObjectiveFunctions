Help! I feel pain tonight I can't sleep
I haven't been diagnosed but I've been getting pretty bad heartburn before and now I've had it for 2 days consistently. I feel worse now because I have chest pain that also feels like striking my heart through until my back cos my back also hurts same area from front.

I drank ibuprofen which I shouldn't have done and prob made it worse. I will go have my checkup as soon as I can, but can someone please help me how to get over tonight with this pain? Home remedies? I've been drinking water, and can't just lay down cos I feel it more.
