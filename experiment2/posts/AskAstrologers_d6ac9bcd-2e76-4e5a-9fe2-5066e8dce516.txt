Chances of redemption for pushy and pressuring behavior towards people with Mars in Libra placement?
It probably goes without question that such a display of behavior would come across as unappealing for Mars in Libra people. But is it something that would leave lasting negative impressions and make them want to permanently distance themselves from you (assuming they still want to be friends with you), or will they change their mind about you if you take steps to show a sense of respect and a level of maturity? I guess a better way to ask this question is do Mars in Libra people forget about pushiness and do they give you second chances as long as you make sure it doesn't happen again?
