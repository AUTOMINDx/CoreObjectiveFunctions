Why do they have to leave and why do i have to care so much
every fucking time i meet someone its like theres a timer until they are physically unable to like me anymore, i dont understand why i have 0 lasting effect. maybe im answering my own question in the title but why the fuck do i have to deal with this competition? all these girls i talk to are seemingly able to get anyone they want, its frustrating when i feel like im on the complete opposite side of that, feels like im not even allowed to be choosy or confident. i know im just being whiny but i hate this so damn much. when iâ€™m alone i dont feel like i even deserve to be happy.
