Alone
I feel so alone these days. I wish my friends were there for me, or for some of them to still be my friends…

I know everyone is busy with their lives but I miss them so much. And nothing that I will say or do will make them come back/be more present, as I’ve tried. Idk what to, I just want my old friends to be here with me. I’m so lonely.

I really want to die.
