How long do the positive effects of the COVID Vaccines last?
I had my two doses months ago, and would like to know what level of protection I likely have/had up until now.

Apologies I Googled this (the news articles are painful, so much filler) and searched the sub but couldnâ€™t find anything recent. I am assuming the more time that passes the better idea we would have.

Thank you in advance
