Vortioxetine making anxiety worse
I've been on vortioxetine (Brintellix or Trintellix) 5mg for two weeks now, and it seems to have made my anxiety much worse, giving me regular panic attacks for the first time in years. 

I can feel fine most of the day, then I'll suddenly get a burst of panic with all the typical symptoms, but occasionally with dizziness and feeling like my vision is zoomed in, which I don't usually get. Last night I started feeling crazy because of the anxiety, worrying that I was losing my mind and struggling to calm myself down. The anxiety seems random too, because I can cope fine at work or in social situations, but then as soon as I'm at home relaxing the panic attacks come.

It's the only real side effect I'm getting from it, and I've pretty much ran out of other antidepressants to try so I'm desperate for vortioxetine to work. Has anyone else had experiences like this either on vortioxetine or other meds? Did it get better? I'm thinking about calling my doctor tomorrow to ask about being put on benzos temporarily to ease the anxiety.
