Any SSRI alternative medications? Hated 2, won't try anymore. So do general doctor's offer anything else? (ignoring hard stuff like xanax)
My current doctor will only give me SSRI's. I've quit zoloft for 2 weeks now cold-turkey...  Is it worth trying to find a new doctor or are SSRI's the only option doctor's give?

I know xanax would help, but I've done it once and hate it. My friend was addicted and one day he said "I just realized it's been 3 months and I don't remember any of it". Him quitting was super tough too.

Med history: Zoloft 50mg first, made my brain feel like sections of it were put in prison. Then on paxil (?) it actually gave me depression. So I went to 25mg zoloft rather than playing more SSRI roulette. It didn't help anxiety, but it did reduce panic attacks and made working easier (basically by numbing my ability to care). A year later I was taking 100mg. 2 weeks ago I just stopped taking it. It sucked ass, but the withdrawals are finally leaving. 

Meditation definitely helps at least, hopefully a few other methods will too. But some kind of medication to give a more constant help would be nice.
