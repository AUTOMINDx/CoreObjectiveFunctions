4th time’s the charm?
I’ve got an interview this week for a digital shelf strategist position. It’s the fourth interview I’ve had in my long 6 months of job searching. It’s fully remote and the pay would be great for me since it’d be my first real job out of college. I’m really crossing my fingers for this one and I’m gonna prepare like crazy.
