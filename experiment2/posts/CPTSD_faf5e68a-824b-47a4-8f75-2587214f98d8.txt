Tapestry Theory
I recently thought of a metaphor that has helped me with how hard I am on myself. I'm not sure it's original, and it may be a modification on a similar one about god (I think?), but I hope it helps.

We are very much like tapestries. The front side, what we show to others, is a beautiful, crafted display of color and design with each thread a decision or moment in time. On the back, is a massive jumble of threads, tangles and ugliness. There's no order, no design, only chaos. Unfortunately, many of us can only see the back side of ourselves. We can only see the ugliness, the jumble of mess, and we begin to think that it's the whole picture. Trauma prevents us from seeing the front, how the choices we make to better ourselves and the world around us becomes beautiful, organized and purposeful.

Working on your trauma, moving forward when it's so very hard, working on therapy even when you don't believe it will work, is what allows us to eventually see the front of ourselves, and to see the value that we have, and the gifts we are to the world. It also allows us to trim the excess thread on the back, and to clean up the loose threads and tangles, so that the back becomes more manageable. It takes careful work, and is a slow process, but nothing in life worth having comes easily. And you are always worth the effort. 

No matter the ugliness you see in yourself, remember that right now you can only see the back of the tapestry. But someday, you will see the gorgeous, indescribable beauty that others get to experience.
