Creating a Small Support Group!
Hey guys, 
I was wondering if anyone wud be interested in forming like a support grup kind of thing online. A small grup maybe of like &lt;10
 
I suffer from moderate cases of anxiety attacks, depression at times, heart palpitations, DpDr (recently) and Hella amounts of stress, tension and panic attacks  at random times. I'm a little concerned that since the past few months my moods/emotions are getting extreme at times and with new advancing symptoms. 

Now I'm no medical expert or anything, and really don't wanna start actual meds for this. Hoping to get things better thru other means.

I thought it wud be a nice idea if we cud get few ppl together to talk about it and help each other get thru it. It feels really good when u talk to someone who understands what u experience. I love my friends and all, But many of them,They don't get it. And I find it hard to talk to them abt it bze advice like, 
 
''Just don't panic'' and
" Stop thinking abt it"
Is pretty much useless. 

Talking to others really helps me too and gets me grounded back to reality.  

 If anyone is interested.
 Feel free to Dm me.  

( I'm 18 and don't mind any age range. But wud be great to get ppl close to my age as well/ ppl with similar symptoms )
