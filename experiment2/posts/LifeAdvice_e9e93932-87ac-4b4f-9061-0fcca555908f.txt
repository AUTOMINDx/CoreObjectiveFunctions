Dating advice for incels?
After debating this subject for years, and having first-hand experience, I have put together the following guide for incels. There is a lot of bluepilled rhetoric masquerading as "advice" on sites like Reddit. Most of the time it's low-effort, "take it or leave it" advice from normies &amp; npcs who have no empathy for people in our position. For the *true* incels out there, they need to accept that they have lost the genetic lottery and thus have little to chance of being romantically or sexually viable. False hope is a torturous way to avoid the harshness of reality. In the end, it is far more dangerous than embracing despair.

Here is some of the usual cod philosophy to watch out for

&gt;1. its ur personality

Personality is a meme. If having a positive personality meant anything, women wouldn't gravitate towards musclehead dudebros or manipulative, emotionally unavailable psychopaths.

Many women will often preach about wanting a man who's "funny, caring and sensitive", but as soon as that man reveals his vulnerable side to her she becomes drier than the Gobi desert. It's simply a shit-test to weed out unmasculine men. Trust me, as much as women will harp on about gender roles, they are only referring to the ones placed on \*them\*.

&gt;2. just work out

Keeping fit is obviously beneficial in general but it is not the key to a girlfriend as so many claim. A man with inferior genetics can pump iron 10x harder than the average chad and women will still overlook him for the naturally attractive guy, After all, the word 'gymcel' exists for a reason. Women are only physically attracted to the top 1-2% of men. If you're not at least a solid 8/10, she will not give you a second look. That is why the majority of women are dating men based on socioeconomic status or superficial charm.

&gt;3. lower ur standards

More plebbit meme advice. It works on the misguided belief that "incels" are all chasing Instagram models. I guess if you lazily assume lonely, single guys are all trying to bat out of their league you don't have to acknowledge their grievances. Also, women are naturally hypergamous, so even if a single guy sets himself a realistic target, the woman will always be looking to punch-up to someone who's higher on the totem pole socially, financially or physically.

&gt;4. don't be an incel

This is quite possibly the most annoying piece of advice, because it's intellectually dishonest and operates on backwards logic. Men who are afflicted with physical disadvantages or developmental disorders are fed into a negative feedback loop during their formative years that will often taint them forever. How could someone not become an incel after being exposed to the cold, unforgiving reality of the dating market?

&gt;5. try a dating app

It's hard to know if this advice is a sick joke or not. Dating apps like Tinder are soul-destroying for even the average schmo. They are a glorified meat market for women to hook up with the most sexually attractive men. The worst thing is that even an average woman will be able to find a Chad for the night, but after she's been pumped and dumped she will still feel entitled to a Chad boyfriend.

&gt;6. get therapy

Therapy is pseudoscientific cope that doesn't change external realities or human nature. It is nothing more than an expensive distraction.
