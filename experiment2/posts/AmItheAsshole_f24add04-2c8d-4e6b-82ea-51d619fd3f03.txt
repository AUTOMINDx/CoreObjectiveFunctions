AITA for crying at the start of Home Alone?
So last night me (14F) and my dad and little brother (11M) were watching Home Alone. You know how Kevin's family are such pricks to him at the start of the movie? Well, I was getting progressively more pissed off and then I snapped when Kevin said "I'm sorry," and the mom said, sarcastic and smiling, "Too late." I called the mom a bitch. My dad paused the movie and yelled at me to not swear. Then he played it and the mom kept being horrible and I started crying because I felt so bad for Kevin. Dad paused it again and yelled that I was ruining the movie and "it's Home Alone, you shouldn't be crying, it's not a deep or emotionally charged movie, it's Home Alone, it's setting up the mood, you shouldn't be upset by it," yada yada yada. I had a few minutes by myself and then was okay for the rest of the movie. but I still felt upset by how Kevin's family treated him.

AITA for crying and possibly ruining the experience?
