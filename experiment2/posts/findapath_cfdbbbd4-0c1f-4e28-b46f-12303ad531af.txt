Do I give up on medicine for radiography
I've had medicine as a desired dream for a long time and from the age of 16, everything has been done for it. I.e trying to achieve the best GCSEs, A-levels onwards. It is not until I've had issues with the aptitude test side of things, that I have encountered major issues. I'm getting on a bit and my family are getting Impatient as to what my solid plans are. I just chose a radiography course to fill my 5 choices in the application process as you can only choose 4 medical schools. Should I do the interview?
