Should I continue studying engineering or switch to business?
I have a two year degree in mechanical engineering and another in design engineering. I found two programs that are 2+2, one being mechanical engineering the other being applied business. 

I'm so confused on what I want to do! I've always said I wanted a business and to work for myself but I also see the value in having a bachelors in engineering opposed to just an associates. 

I can find some 50-75K a year jobs with a 2 year engineering degree but with a bachelor's I could find more in the 75-100K range. I currently make 55K but am not in an engineering position, but rather a 'technical' position. Something I want to get out of soon for the sake of experience value -- this is kind of like a desperate covid job. 

But if I go for business it won't really aid my engineering career, it will be mostly just for myself. But does that even make sense? Don't we go to college to get a job? Or should I do something untraditional and just learn business? 

It feels like I'm making a decision to either be a business owner one day or work for someone else for the rest of my life and it is driving me mad.
