my recovery update!
hi all,

so i got diagnosed with ptsd about a year ago. i was struggling with panic attacks, flashbacks, dissociation, beliefs about people etc and it was severely getting in the way of my happiness and relationships. i tried emdr and it sent me flailing into a dissociative and depressive episode. i felt horrible and confused and like there was no where to start and too much to cover. 

but i recently began trauma therapy again with my therapist, and just in the last few months i’ve gotten tremendously better. i can handle almost all the things that triggered me before. i don’t get nightmares (as much) and im learning that some of my beliefs might be incorrect. not my fault, but not helpful either. i’ve only worked on one little section of my trauma but i feel much better and less tied down. i hope that gives whoever needs it inspiration to keep trying. even if it means quitting something that’s not working and trying something else or taking a break or doing self care or anything. much love to everyone here.
