Looking for a career change! What’s your job and why do you love it?
Transitioning out of teaching, but I have no idea what career I actually want to be in. I know it depends on the person, but I would love to read about jobs that make people happy. 


Also…. If you want to give advice on a career switch for me, please do so! A bit about me: 
I actually love teaching (but I can’t deal with administration and parents anymore). I love editing and all things writing. But I need to be around humans everyday. 

I love socializing with others and am really good with people. 

I really enjoy working hard for a purpose. I like knowing I’m making a difference and that makes me dedicated to my job.
