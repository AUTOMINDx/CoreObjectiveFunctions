I feel like therapy would just be weak
Going to therapy and seeking help would require me to open up to my family about my loneliness and anxiety, something I never shared with anyone else ever. I feel that if I did this, I would just be failing them because it would be revealed to the people that I care about most, that their expectations (which weren’t even that high) was too much to handle and that I was failing to succeed due to my inability to socialize and my depression stemming from my loneliness.

Therapy would just make me feel weak and pathetic and it probably wouldn’t even be effective. So Taking this large step of being honest with my loved ones would require courage that I will never have so I guess I will just silently struggle for now.
