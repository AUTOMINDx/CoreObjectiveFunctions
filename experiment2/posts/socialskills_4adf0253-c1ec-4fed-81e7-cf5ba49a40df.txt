Friend constantly emotionally dumps on me.
So I have this friend I made about two years ago. We became very close very fast and overall, our friendship in the first year was pretty pleasant. The moment I became part of what she considers her “inner circle”/support system, things really started to change. 
She calls and messages me every day, all throughout the day, unloading her problems on me. Don’t get me wrong, I pride myself in being a good listener and someone who enjoys giving advice. But our conversations started becoming consistently negative. We both have anxiety so she knows I relate to it, but for days on end every message she sent was her talking about her anxiety without a break. I always talk her down and work through it with her, so I guess she uses me as somewhat of a therapist. Then there are other things like marital problems, family problems, parenting problems, etc. etc. etc. that also made their way into our conversations. I started to feel like every time we talked it was a therapy session. Me sitting there listening and giving advice all day long. Sometimes I would sit and wonder how long it would be before she would finally ask me about about how I’m doing, and on the rare times she does if I say something like “oh just working a lot and very tired” I get a, “me too” then the rants continue…

I’ve noticed at time of her life that she’s in a better place, conversations all of a sudden become dry and distant. I will tell her something positive about my life and I get one word responses. She usually will stay quiet and seem disinterested if I talk about work or family, etc. it’s like if we aren’t discussing her drama she has nothing to say.

My question here is, is this means to cut someone off? I hold on because how great our friendship used to be. But it’s so exhausting now. Any relatable stories or advice would be helpful.
