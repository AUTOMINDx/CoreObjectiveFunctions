WHY DO I HAVE A LOW SELF STEEM YET AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT ALL THE GUYS THAT WANT TO TALK TO ME ARE FLIRTING?
In one side, I believe that I’ll never get a boyfriend because I’m just too ugly for anyone, but on the other side, I think that if a guy just says “hi” or something, I immediately think that they are flirting with me?
