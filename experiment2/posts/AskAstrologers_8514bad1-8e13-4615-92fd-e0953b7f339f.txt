question about house overlays in synastry
I've noticed a trend that the closest people in my life and past relationships always have planets falling in my 4th, 8th or 12th house (usually moon, mars or venus) but my planets seem to fall in more "light hearted" houses of theirs like the 3rd or 9th sometimes 5th and i was wondering in the context of romantic relationships would the overlay create more of a "deep connection" type feeling for me only? and would they not view the relationship in the same way or are these overlays mutual
