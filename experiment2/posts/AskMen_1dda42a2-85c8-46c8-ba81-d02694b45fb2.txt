AskMen, In your opinion what do you think are the most beautiful machines ever created?
I may be biased, but my vote would have to go to the Supermarine Spitfire, a British ww2 fighter plane. With its iconic elliptical wings and elegant lines it just looks gorgeous to me. Somehow graceful yet deadly, and the roar of the Merlin V12 engine is like music to my ears.
What machines of the past or present (I guess can also be fictional) give you a bit of a semi chub?
