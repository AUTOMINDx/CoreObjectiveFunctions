Are genes truly real?
Because I read about Trofim Lysenko who was a strong proponent of Lamarckism and rejected Mendelian genetics. To my understanding, Darwin was a Lamarckist too. Mendelianism has been largely rejected in modern day understanding.

&gt;It is a historical fact that, in genetics, Darwin was a Lamarckist (Ghiselin, 1973). In his The Origin of Species, Darwin (1872) emphasized: "I think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited." He accepted the inheritance of acquired characters as a possible source of new variation upon which natural selection acted, and claimed that "selection does nothing without variability, and this depends in some manner on the act of the surrounding circumstances on the organism". In The Variation of Animals and Plants under-Domestication, Darwin (1875) clearly stated that "'a multitude of newly-acquired characters, whether injurious or beneficial, whether of the lowest or highest vital importance, are often faith- fully transmitted- frequently even when one parent alone possesses some new peculiarity; and we may on the whole conclude that inheritance is the rule, and non-inheritance the anomaly". He favoured the view that "variations of all kinds and degrees are directly or indirectly caused by the conditions of life to which each being, and more especially its ancestors, have been exposed." (Darwin, 1875).

Mendel has himself admitted in his own writings that his "observations" and predictions about inheritance were likely only observable in the specific pea plants he worked on and in few other organisms.

&gt;In a paper in Physics of Life Reviews in 2013, James Shapiro describes how cells and organisms are capable of natural genetic engineering." That is, they frequently alter their own DNA sequences, rewriting their own genomes throughout life. The startling implication is that the gene as popularly conceived-a blueprint on a strand of DNA, determining development and its variations-does not really exist.

I don't think codons are the same thing as "genes". Codons &amp; non-coding DNA sequences are the opposite of genes, proteins are also not commensurable with phenotypic characteristics.

&gt;… that is, whether a gene is "on or "off." In 1991 O. E. Landman published an article expressing incredulity that so many biologists re mained convinced of a basic contradiction between the principle of the inheritance of acquired characteristics and molecular biology. On the contrary, he wrote, the inheritance of acquired characteristics is "fully compatible with current concepts of molecular genetics," and he pointed to examples of such inheritance. These developments pro- vided an important background and a prehistory to the blossoming of epigenetics in the early years of the twenty-first century.

Lysenko was proven correct even in soy bean plant experiments.

Japanese studies also proved Lysenko was correct in the 1950s: [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsbbs1951/5/3/5\_3\_202/\_pdf](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsbbs1951/5/3/5_3_202/_pdf)
