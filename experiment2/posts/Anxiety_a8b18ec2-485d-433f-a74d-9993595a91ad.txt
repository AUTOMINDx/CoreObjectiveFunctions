I found a hack I thought I should share
Long story short I have a really hard time taking care of myself due to feelings a guilt and shame. I found out that if I set a timer (for example for cleaning) and I keep the amount of time very low like 30mins. I tell myself I going to clean for 30min with no stopping and once the 30mins are over I can be done for the day. I have remind myself that anything I do for the 30mins is improvement. It doesn’t matter what I do, I am now better than I was 30mins ago. Every so often I up the time. After the timer goes off I stop what I am doing and do one activity that I enjoy, guilt free. 

I don’t know if that explanation was good at all but thought I should share. Good luck out there my friends. Love you all ❤️
