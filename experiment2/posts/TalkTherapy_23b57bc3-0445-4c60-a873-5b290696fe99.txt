Worried about my Therapistâ€™s holiday trip
So a few months ago, my therapist gave me the heads up that she will be away during the holidays and all of January.  Iâ€™m going to be sad to not see her for a while but she deserves the time off. 

The thing that worries me is that sheâ€™s going overseas to a country going through many crisisâ€™s. Iâ€™m so worried that something is going to happen to her over there. We briefly talked about her trip a few sessions ago. But I wasnâ€™t being 100% honest and only said I was worried that she would forget me ðŸ˜…

She reassured me that it would never happen and also gave me a few options to talk to her colleagues or message her in January for a check in ðŸ˜… That made me feel a bit better but I guess Iâ€™m still obsessing over the countryâ€™s multiple crisisâ€™s ðŸ˜¢ I could mention this to her in our last session in December but I feel like anything she would say wouldnâ€™t help. She could say that she will be safe and can take care of herself. But you never know what could happen when thereâ€™s so much instability going on over there ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… Researching it on YouTube isnâ€™t helping eitherâ€¦so Iâ€™m going to stop doing that ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒSigh, I just want her and her family to be safe ðŸ˜…
