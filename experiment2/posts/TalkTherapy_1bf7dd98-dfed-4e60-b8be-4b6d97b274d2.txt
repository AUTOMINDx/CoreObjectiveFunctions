Starting therapy again
I'm starting therapy again and I'm feeling nervous. I have insurance now so only have to pay a copay so at least it won't be financially draining.  I'm hoping that aspect helps me feel less stressed about the process. 

I'm approaching this therapy after some time away from it. Before when I entered therapy I was pretty emotionally dysregulated and substance abusing. Now I'm sober and I feel like I can be present. I know what issues I want to work on- namely my relationships. How to reconcile being estranged from my family and still childhood traumas. But I'm feeling so nervous. Lately I've felt myself being very stressed and I'm worried about slipping into a depression so I decided to start therapy again. 

Finding a therapist is like dating. I just want to be understood. She says she works with PTSD clients so we will see. 

I found myself rehearsing what to say to her today on the phone for our intitial consultation. Because I just want to be understood. Maybe I should tell her that..phone consultations make me so nervous because it's like they want to screen me to see if I'm crazy...if I'm too much... Which is how I've been treated by everyone close to me throughout my life.

So I'm just super nervous and looking for some advice.... Thanks
