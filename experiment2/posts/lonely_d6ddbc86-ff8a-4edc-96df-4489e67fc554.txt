Fuck this shit
I try to be a good friend but I always end up getting bent over backwards. "Sorry I don't think we can be friends anymore" or "..." yep ghosting and never answering me. I've lost too many friends to count and now I'm just over it. Im sick of never having anyone to trust and to be there for me. "You're a good friend" oh yeah? Well why do you always end up fucking off!?
