What tools do you use to help/cope with cptsd/anxiety?
So far what I've decided to try out is: 

- Weighted blanket. (Not recommended when you're claustrophobic, only if you like having weight on you)
- CBD oil.
- Acupressure mat.
- Eating healthy.
- Sleeping in.
- CBT with a psychologist.
- Hypnotherapy. (1x)
- MDMA therapy with a therapist. (3x) - helped the most so far.
- Sleeping with a plushie. 
- Taking care of a cute kitten.
- Quit drinking. 
- Quit weed.
- Cut out toxic family members. (My mantra for them "Don't take critizism from someone you wouldn't take advice from".)
- I don't let anyone who is toxic befriend me. (My mantra for this: Be loyal to yourself first)
- Started accepting myself.
- Going to try out to be vegetarian in January 2022
- Read so many psychology books.
- Take vitamins and iron
- Cut out some social media (Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook)
- Massage
- Acupuncture

I'm writing this list so others can maybe see anything there that would help them or that resonates. If you've tried something that works well for you, feel free to write it down in the comments. :)
