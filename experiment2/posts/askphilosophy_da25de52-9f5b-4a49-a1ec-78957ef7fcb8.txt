How to prepare for Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit?
Sorry in advance for a long question.

I read philosophy as a hobby and I recently finished Kant's first Critique (which I loved). Before that, I read both of Hume's Enquiries, Kant's Prolegomena, Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics and portions of the Organon, some Descartes, several of Plato's dialogues, and some assorted Presocratic fragments (Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, and Parmenides).

I listed what I've read above because Hegel has a reputation for being extremely difficult. As a hobbyist, I know I'll probably never be completely prepared for Hegel, but are these works generally of comparable difficulty, or is Hegel much harder? (Once I got used to his odd way of writing, Kant was actually pretty fun to read, but I'm not sure if Hegel is harder or just difficult in a different way.)

Also, I'm willing to read additional works in preparation for Phenomenology of Spirit if they'll help orient me in the text (like Hume does for reading Kant). I've heard people mention Fichte, Schelling, and Spinoza as being useful for understanding Hegel, for example. Which thinkers and/or primary source texts should I read to make Hegel understandable for someone at my level? (Secondary sources are welcome too)

Thanks!
