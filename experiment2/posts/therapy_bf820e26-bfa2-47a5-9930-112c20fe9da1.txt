I’m not sure how to talk to my therapist about SA
I have another therapy appointment soon but I’m not sure how to talk to her. I’ve only had three sessions with her so far. I feel like I have to talk to her about a crisis I’m going through but doing so I have to explain that I experienced SA. How do I bring this up to her causally? I’m afraid that she’ll think of me differently. I know I probably should be honest with her but I’m scared that I’m overwhelming her too.
