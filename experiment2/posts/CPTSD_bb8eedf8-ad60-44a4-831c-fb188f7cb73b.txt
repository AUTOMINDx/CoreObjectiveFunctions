How do you cope with the fact that abusers are everywhere and will always target YOU specifically?
Every job I've had, every group I've joined, every social activity I've participated in... They're everywhere.

And at first sight they identify me for what I've always been: A fucking victim for their hideous campaign of relentless abuse, which will make short work of the years of progress I've made since the last abuser wrecked everything.

Started a new job lately, the company narc clocked me in seconds and we're straight back to square fucking one; I know any retaliation on my part will only make things a million times worse, and within a week they have me fired and back to unemployment til the next narc-laden job.

Honestly I want to give up. The thought that this is my lot in life drains any possible joy with immediate effect. Everyone around me gets by without a problem, maybe a little occasional flak from an abuser, yet this full-on bullshit's always waiting for me around every fucking corner. Literally what is the point?
