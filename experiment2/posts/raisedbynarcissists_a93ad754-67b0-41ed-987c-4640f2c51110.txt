The time my nmom said I was “hateful” because I wouldn’t put a car in my name
Back in college when I was very broke and didn’t even have a car of my own my mom contacts me out of nowhere and says she needs $2,000. I was 21 and probably only had $800 to my name. She tells me she needs the money for a down payment on a car. But the car she had was perfectly fine but she didn’t like that it sat low and the AC wasn’t working. 

In my head I’m thinking, if you don’t have the down payment you probably can’t afford a new car. Of course I tell her I don’t have it and she gets mad then demands that I put the car in my name…

So her credit is terrible, she doesn’t have a down payment, and she wants to put the vehicle in my name. I tell her I’m not doin that because she’s going to ruin my credit then I’ll be responsible for a vehicle I don’t even drive. 

Then she gets pissed and says I’m hateful and I never help her and that she’ll do it on her own. 

Great, I’m glad you’re being an adult. 

And this is why we never speak.
