23f, is it safe for me to be taking Benadryl every night?
I’ve been taking Benadryl every night, not exaggerating, but every night since June of 2021. 

I had the worst eczema itch, i wanted to peel my skin off so bad and I went to the ER after the 1st week of non stop itching. I cried and cried for days cause of how bad it was. 

They prescribed me some thing along with Benadryl. It helped me so fucking much! 

Made an appointment with my dermatologist, I was given this cream: Betamethasone

But I only used it for a bit, because I kept taking Benadryl. 2 pills every night (50mg). 

I still itch to this day, and I did stop using the cream. I know I know, stupid of me. But the Benadryl helps me so much and I always get the best sleep of my life. 

I haven’t experienced any symptoms from taking it, I feel ok. 

But is there any long term side effects? It’s the only thing that has been helping me, and it helps my sleep because I don’t sleep as much.
