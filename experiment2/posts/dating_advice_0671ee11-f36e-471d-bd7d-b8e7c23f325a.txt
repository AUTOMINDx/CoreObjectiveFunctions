A female friend texted me "Love you" and later deleted the message
I (19M) have this female friend (18F). We have known each other for years and are also classmates currently, so we know each other fairly well.

A little over a year ago, I was in love with her and I confessed to her. She rejected me at the time which is of course totally fair.

Afterwards we stayed as friends and we have a positive relationship.

Fast forward to last night, where she sent me some hearts and a message that said "Love you". This caught me completely off guard.

Furthermore. Last week we were at a party and after the party she sent me a message that went like "Damn* you looked good tonight (my name)" and another one that said "I really liked your dress up. It suited you". 

Now as I said previously, we have a positive relationship and it's not too rare for us to compliment each other. So I didn't really think much of those messages at the time, and I simply replied "You looked damn good too tbh".

But now I'm thinking these might not all just have been platonic compliments.

Anyways I felt overwhelmed and I decided to go to sleep so I could make a rational decision in the morning. But now that I wake up, she has deleted that message.

She was also at a party last night so she definitely had something to drink.

So now I'm wondering: Did *she* send the message? Did she send it intentionally to me or did she mean to send it to someone else? Why did she delete it? Insecurity? Confused about her own feelings?

I'm really overwhelmed by this and I could use some help.

*'Damn' is the closest word in English to what she wrote, when I'm trying to translate the meaning. A direct translation would be "Shut up". But I generally don't see it being used like that in English.
