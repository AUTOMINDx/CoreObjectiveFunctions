Asking PHD scholarship in Aus?
Hi everybody!

I  am international student and graduated master research course in Aus.  My profesor already contacted with me last week to suggest me  scholarship in PHD. Although i did not have any publications but my WAM  is quiet high (over 85). So the probability of having scholarship is  high? And how long i get outcome of my scholarship after submitting EOI?
