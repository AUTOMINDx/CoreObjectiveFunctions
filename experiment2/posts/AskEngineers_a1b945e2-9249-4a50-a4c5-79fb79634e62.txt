Design Ideas for my top down Hash Agitator
Hey folks,

I make hash making equipment and am working on a new design for a tipping tank ice water agitator. After agitation the tank tips to allow you to dump out the spent biomass. 

I am looking for ideas on the best way to deal with the paddle being in the way when the tank goes to tip.

Few things:

1) bottom machine seal drive agitation is not an option

2) current ideas involve either unpinning the paddle and removing manually, or tipping the full tank with agitator and all

Would there be a way to retract the shaft up and through the gear box?

Current design ideas:
