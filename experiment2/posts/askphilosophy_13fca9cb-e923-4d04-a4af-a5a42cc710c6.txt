Could I not exist? - Epistemological nihilism
A few months back I was watching a discussion between CosmicSkeptic and Rationality Rules about epistemological nihilism and Rationality Rules said something along the lines of "It is possible that I could not exist" and his reasoning for this was that the laws of logic are not known to be objective, therefore it could be the case that he could exist and not exist at once. It seems strange to me to say that I cannot know if I do not exist, because if it is posited that I do not exist, then wouldn't I be a counterexample to disprove that statement? It seems fundamentally ignorant to say that the laws of logic cannot be proven, because they are the fundamental building blocks of how we prove things.

BTW I mean from the point of view of myself.
