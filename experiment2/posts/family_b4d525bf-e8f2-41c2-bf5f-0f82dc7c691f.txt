What could've made ur childhood better? /how do u give a child the best childhood?
My mum is having a baby soon with her bf and tbh I have no clue how it'll go (there's been a mess between the whole family due to her bf but everything seems to be fixed now)
I'm 15 and just want to make sure that my baby brother has a good childhood and relationship with me but I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it concidering our family issues which could come back and also the pretty large age gap between us. I also grew up way differently to how the kid will grow up so I feel like our experiences will differ. I constantly had my mum and dad arguing and eventually splitting and I DEFFINETLY don't want that for him too. As well as that he will have a lot more money growing up than I did and other things like that. 

If ur a younger sibling, what could ur older sibling have done to be better or make u happy?
Or if ur a parent is there anything u wish that ur eldest would do/help with etc?

Just share anything relevant tbh :))  tysm
