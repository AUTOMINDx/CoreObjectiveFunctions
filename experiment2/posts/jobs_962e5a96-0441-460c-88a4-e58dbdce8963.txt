Worker Shortage and Everyone’s Hiring
I just got a rejection email to go into the pile of all the other rejection emails. All the jobs I am applying for, I meet 100% of the qualifications. 

The only jobs I have ever gotten in my entire life have been jobs where someone knows someone. Well, I’ve aged and lost connections now. People have changed. What do we have to do these days to get a job to hire us? So discouraging.
