Possible tips for a TA
Hi,  
I'm not sure if this have been asked before, but I hope someone can help. I have what someone described as 'Thomas Sangster problem'. The first semester no student believed I would be substituting the professor and one even mocked me saying that I was just hazing. They didn't believe me until the professor had to show up himself and explain that it was part of the graduate program. Every time is the same thing. Which tips do you have to look older? I tried changing my clothing style and wearing only dark colours, but it didn't work.  My tutor suggested wearing glasses and only speak with my lower register, but I didn't try it yet. In some study groups, the feeling is very similar, the difference is that they know my age and it's very frustrating. How do you manage those situations?  


Thanks
