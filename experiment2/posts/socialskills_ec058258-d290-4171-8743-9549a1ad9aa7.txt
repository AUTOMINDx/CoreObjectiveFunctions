Quality, relationship building conversations
How do you tell the difference between casual conversation (like basic facts about self, random stories and small talk or funny anecdotes) and bonding conversations that are actually moving the relationship forward on both ends?

Does it involve sharing something vulnerable about yourself? Showing more emotions? Sharing more stories? More details? More names and dates?

I cried in front of someone after sharing how proud I felt that I moved to a new city and was achieving my goals finally. We talked about it later and I shared how much of a vulnerable moment that was for me but she said crying isn’t really sharing much. I felt confused because crying in front of someone for the first time is really opening up for me and I personally considered that the start of having a stronger friendship with her.

I’ve felt this way before, when I think I’m sharing so much of myself with others but then they would tell me that they wished I would have talked more.

What is your perception of “opening up”?

What topics or actions does it take to build a deeper connection (versus remaining casual friends)?
