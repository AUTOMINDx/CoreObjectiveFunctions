My dreams aren’t nightmares but they aren’t better either
I used to have nightmares about my abuser. Now in my dreams we just act like a regular couple and I always have an idea something is wrong but I can’t remember what. I’m tired of hanging out with him Everytime I sleep. I’m afraid to sleep. Anyone have any tips?
