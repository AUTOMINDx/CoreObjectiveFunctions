is it normal to have a week-long wedding that the guests pay for?
A little context: I'm a bridesmaid. My close friend is having the wedding in Mexico. She's footing the bill of the entire wedding day itself (of course) but she expects me to be there for an entire week.

The thing is- I'm expected to pay for the hotel, and she has chosen the hotel (its 5 star), and I'm paying for the flights, and I'm paying for generally any and every other activity that I do on this trip that isn't the wedding itself. Food, drink, etc etc.

This is going to cost me thousands. I do have the money for it, but I'm not exactly rich, and I would be using up my precious holiday days for a vacation i don't ACTUALLY want. I'm not even going to be bringing a partner, so it's not like I can turn it into something romantic, and I hardly know any of her friends or family. Plus, I'm not even going to be spending much time with my friend herself as she's going to be wrapped up with other guests and her husband-to-be.

Is this normal? I haven't been to many weddings, so I don't even know... I agreed to it at the time when she suggested it but only because I thought she was paying for the hotel or something, but maybe I was being incredibly naive... I'm frustrated but she's incredibly excited and saying how wonderful it's going to be to have me there, and I really don't want to break my agreement about the full week...

edit: the wedding itself happens on day 3
