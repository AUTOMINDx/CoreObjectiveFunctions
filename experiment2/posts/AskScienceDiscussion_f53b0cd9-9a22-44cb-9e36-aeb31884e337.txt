Given concerns over whether vaccines provide sufficient protection against new variants of COVID, are there any concerns that lateral flow or PCR tests will not detect new variants?
As in, is there anything different in the antigen response that means lateral flow tests can't/won't spot a new variant, or that the DNA that PCR is looking for will change significantly?
