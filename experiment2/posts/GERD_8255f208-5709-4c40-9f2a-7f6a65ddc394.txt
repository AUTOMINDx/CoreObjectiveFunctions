Throbbing in your throat?
Anyone have like a throbbing sensation in your throat? Doesn't seem to have any real trigger, but definitely highly likely when I go from laying to standing. It doesn't hurt, only can feel it pulse a handful of times then it's gone. 
That along with bouts of my throat feeling constricted/clogged. So I'll have issues trying to clear my throat(I know it's bad but it feels great when it does clear lol) for 20-40mins at a time maybe 5-7 times a day. 

Just makes me nervous. I was diagnosed with the gerd and a hiatal hernia a couple years ago, and the past year I've been off of the Omeprazole (40mg daily) by choice I guess you could say.
