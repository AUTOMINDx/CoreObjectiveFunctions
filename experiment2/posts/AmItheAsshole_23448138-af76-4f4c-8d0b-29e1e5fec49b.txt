AITA for telling my wife she is being ridiculous about my mother?
I am the stay at home parent for our special needs child,who is 3. I've been the stay at home parent since they were born - my wife works in the medical field, is finishing school for higher nurse credential, and loves her job. I worked call enters and hated how soul sucking it is, and so I suggested being the stay at home.

My mother comes from the same country I do. She visits every 2 years or so. She is here now, and my wife is going on about how I can sponsor her to come over permanently. I tell her that no, as a permanent resident and not a citizen, I can't do that. She argues with me that she just read it and therefore I, who has been through the system, clearly don't know because "it's been 10 years since you went through it". I double check on USCIS to make sure, and I'm right, I cannot do it.

Her next response I that we can just keep her illegally, that nobody would bother to check, she can stay with my child and her and I can go to work and provide everything. I say that she's being ridiculous an stupid, as that would both not work, and could risk my own residency. She walked off annoyed that I called her idea stupid and ridiculous.

AITA for not acquiescing on this? I think even thinking it through as a legitimate idea is stupid, as it would not be possible. I will say that part of the reason is also because I've been out of any work for awhile now and I know how hard it will be to find a job that pays anything above minimum wage - I don't think that's worth sacrificing time with our child for. And I don't want to risk my own residency, nor any sort of legal bullshittery that could lead to jail, fines, or anything that could negative impact our household.
