as much as loneliness hurts, I don't think I'd have it any other way
I'm not sure how to word this, it's like 3AM and I'm at work lol so here you go.

I just feel like, even if I had the ideal life I'm dreaming about, I would still seek solace. even if I had friends and people around me, this feeling of never belonging won't cease to stop. I'm at some point in my life where I crave human interaction on a deeper level, but won't settle for people that disrespect me, push me, use me, constantly try to change and belittle me. and it seems as though being close to someone means just that.

I think that's why being lonely is such a highly spread issue, because finding someone who treats you as an equal and just enjoys your presence without second motives is the hardest thing to find, both platonically and romantically. after seeing how shitty humans are to each other and how they only use you for their needs but never give something back, being alone doesn't seem that bad.

I don't know where I'm going with this, but yeah. loneliness sucks, but being around people is even worse.
