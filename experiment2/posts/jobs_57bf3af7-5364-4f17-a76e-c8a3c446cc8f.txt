How to cope with working full time
I recently graduated uni in June and was lucky enough to get a grad job which i started a few months after. However, I have been really struggling with adjusting to working full time to the point where I have started getting bad anxiety before work. For example, i will have my alarm set for 7:20 but will naturally wake up around 6:30 and get this nervous feeling. The idea of full time work just makes me feel sad and overwhelmed. How do I cope with working full time? I just want to feel okay about going into work and not have this nervous feeling. The weird thing is when I'm at work I feel okay.
