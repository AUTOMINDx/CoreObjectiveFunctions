Being replaced with MULTIPLE people
Don't you just love it when you are putting in ungodly hours for an employer, like 14 hours a day Monday through Friday and another 12 hours on both Saturday and Sunday, only to be told that you aren't doing enough with them not understanding why it is taking you so long?  Over the weekend, I found out that they replaced me with two full-time employees, one contract employee, and tried to get a fourth to come back to train everyone on how to do MY job.

Karma...
