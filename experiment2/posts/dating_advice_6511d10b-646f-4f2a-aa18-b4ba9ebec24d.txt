I don’t have Facebook or Instagram.

Would this be a negative or a potential red flag for some people? 

I know they’re two of the most used platforms and I’ve had people ask me what I’m hiding. 

Reason for not using them is I just find it full of people im not really interested in and find them quite attention seeking with the need for likes ect.
