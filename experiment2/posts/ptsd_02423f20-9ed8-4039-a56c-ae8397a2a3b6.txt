Christmas is horribly triggering
I have a few months to move out of my abusive parents house. Just a few more months. A year at most. I really was getting hopeful that I could make it that far. I forgot how awful the holidays are for me.

My ex boyfriend broke up with me Christmas Eve 2017 when I told him I was pregnant. He said he was going to marry his other girlfriend. They’re married now. He raped me so many times in college dorms as she watched back then. There are other details I don’t want to disclose just know late October-February are nightmare inducing times.

My parents love Christmas and holidays. The house is intensely decorated and Christmas music is constantly playing. They don’t understand ptsd and refuse to. I spend most of my time in my room with a sound machine blasting. Just seeing most of the holiday stuff sends me into panic and I end up screaming and convulsing till I collapse. My mother said “well the holiday is everywhere you just got to get over it.”

Both of them treat my reactions as annoyances. My anxiety makes the family look bad.

I’m trying to survive. if anyone has any tips on how to cope I’m all ears
