AITA for "stealing" my mothers cat?
My(16f) parents are divorced. My father has main custody of me but my mother gets every other weekend. We've had this arrangement for several months. I usually try to find a way around it, either by being “sick” or spending the weekend with a friend. 

When my parents were divorced we had 2 cats and a dog. My mother got to keep one of the cats, and my dad and I kept the other cat and the dog. This was decided by them. Since they split, every time I've been over there the cat is skinny and has matted fur. 

The last time I was there, this weekend, her new boyfriend was there. He's allergic to cats apparently so the cat was kicked out of the house. She has never been an outside cat so doesn't know how to survive. 

I brought the cat with me when I left. My mother hasn't noticed but my dad and his girlfriend say I shouldn't have interfered with their agreement and stolen her cat. 

I think he's actually glad to have the cat back though, but he's saying I have to give her back the next time I'm at my moms house. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here. 

AITA for taking her?
