Full-Time Opportunities for Aerospace Engineering Degree in Indianapolis?
Current senior studying aerospace engineering and trying to find full-time positions in the Indianapolis, or central Indiana area.  Application already sent out to Rolls-Royce and will continue checking their website for postings.  Wondering if anyone knows of other companies or positions in this area that may even be tangentially related to aerospace or my degree?  

Best regards.
