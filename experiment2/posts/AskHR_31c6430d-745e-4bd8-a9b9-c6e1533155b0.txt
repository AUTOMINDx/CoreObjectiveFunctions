[CAN] I was recently fired because I no longer meet minimum availability. When do I receive my vacation pay?
Ontario. 

***TLDR: What's standard for receiving vacation pay? When does it get paid out? I need to know to budget.***

I've been working full time. I'm also full time in school. I told them next semester my schedule at school is more hectic when I was hired. I reminded them of this whenever asked. 

I got my final schedule recently and when I notified them I was immediately fired for not meeting minimum availability. We're still on good terms, it wasn't angry or anything, but it was a very direct "if you can't meet the business needs, you need to return work equipment and we will get someone else to take over". I may return when I finish school given that I can work full time. It wasn't specifically said that I was fired, but since I had to return work equipment I can no longer do my job from home. 

Given that I have exams and everything right now, I don't even mind the short notice, that's not the issue. 

I'm wondering about vacation pay. I worked something like 600 hours over 4 months. Now that I have no income, I can only survive 3 months with no pay. So I'm budgeting how long I can last on the savings I have and trying to look for a part time job that will allow me to work 1 day per week which should be enough to last another month.
