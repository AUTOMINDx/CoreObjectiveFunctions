Theoretically, if everyone in the world stayed at home for a month or two, will Covid and many other diseases go extinct?
If sacrificing a month of freedom means completely getting rid of Covid, why aren't there more people doing it? And for the people who are against masks and vaccines, shouldn't they be more inclined to lock themselves up. Covid goes extinct = no need to wear masks and get vaccinated. This is just beyond logical to me.   
I am all for freedom and what not, but desperate times call for desperate measures. I seriously don't see how this is going to end if governments don't step up, with the variants popping up left and right.
