HELP!! Accidentally ingested coolant
Hello

This   is going to sound silly but Im a noob when it comes to repairing my   car.  A couple of   days ago I tried draining the radiator on an old 98 chevy malibu. The   drain plug was extremly hard to unplug, forcing me to use excessive   torque than I should have. When it finally came loose, the coolant shot   me in the face and inside my mouth( I was underneath the radiator). I   spat the coolant out right away but still manage to drank maybe a   spoonful or less of it. How serious is ingesting coolant even small   quantity? I had this "cool breathing since it happened( Yesterday) and   nausea. Nothing too serious as of yet. Im a Male, 30 weight 160

Thanks for all the answers, guys. So far I been symptom-free even the awful taste has faded. And yes, I did call poison control and they told me I should be fine but my paranoid self wanted to see If anyone else had this happened to them. Thanks again for the answers.
