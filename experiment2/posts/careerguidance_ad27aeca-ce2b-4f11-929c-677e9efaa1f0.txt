How can you work remotely in the writing field?
I'm 24f and am a late bloomer I suppose you could say. I'm about to finish a year and a half of university studies to earn my bachelors degree in Communications. 

I'm very interested in having a career in the writing field possibly as a content writer. But in all honesty I have no idea where to begin! With no real experience except for doing university essays and writing on my free time as a hobby I just don't know where to look to get a serious job where I would actually get hired. What qualifications would I need to become a potential employee somewhere? 

I don't know if I'm shooting myself in the foot by picking creative writing as my minor or if I should just stick to marketing even though it doesn't really interest me too much. 

How can I prepare myself before I finish my studies? I really wish to begin a career as soon as I graduate.
