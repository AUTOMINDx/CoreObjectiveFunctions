“Should” Make Friends
I see myself as someone who isn’t particularly social, and I don’t often find myself wanting to meet people and make friends. However I’m often left with this feeling that I “should” want to make friends and have a vibrant social life. That there is something wrong with me because I don’t want that and my success will be limited because of it. Can anyone else relate to this?
