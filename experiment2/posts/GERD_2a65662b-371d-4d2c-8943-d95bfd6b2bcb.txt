How to wean off PPI
Took 40mg pantoprazole for 5 weeks. Usually 4 out of 7 days a week with breaks due to the insane anxiety id get from this drug. Was using it for severe heartburn that went away. I called gi doc she said you can just stop which I did, but its been almost 2 months off now, and I've began using it x2 a week because I've been having belly button pain and above belly button which gi doctor told me I can't help since I had an endoscopy 2 years ago. I feel like these new pains which bring me to my knees especially after eating is due to the damn pantoprazole even though I only took it for 5 weeks. Currently, im taking 40 mg pantoprazole every third day and even though its really helping I need off, maybe just once a week. Am also in process of getting second opinion from another gi doc.
