Working with big egos and broken sensitivity
What are the behaviours that you would recommend while working as a team of seniors (7 to 40 years of experience more than you) who have inflated egos and has a complete lack of sensitivity and do not respect your personal deadlines in the interest of the projects (job applications, work permit deadlines)? You also don't have any other choice to select a different team.
