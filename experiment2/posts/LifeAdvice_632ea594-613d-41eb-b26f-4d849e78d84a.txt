I'm surrounded by family who I know love me. Why does it feel meaningless to me?
I live with my parents and siblings who all care about me but I'm so distant from them in an emotional level and the only person in my family I'd say I'm close to is my sister. But they're right there and I remember all the amazing times I've had with them but sometimes it all just seems so meaningless to me. I'm so scared I'll lose one of them and not even feel a thing, I don't want to be the guy who had everything then lost it. Next year I'll be leaving them for university and it'll probably be the last time I live with them so I want to make things right as fast as I can. I'm looking forward to any advice y'all can give and I hope they help.
