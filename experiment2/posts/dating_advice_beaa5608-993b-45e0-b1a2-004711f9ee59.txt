What are realistic and achievable improvements I can make in my life to make myself more attractive to women?
I'm mostly asking for female perspective here, but I really appreciate any advice. I'm 25 years old and really want to improve myself, but because I don't really fit in socially I don't know what people value most.

What I mean by "realistic and achivable" is that it is;

A. Not something that is an inherited trait I can't control, i.e. height or head shape. Something ACTUALLY malleable.

B. Is financially viable, i.e. while it might help for me to fix my teeth I can't really afford braces, and I can't magically make myself a millionaire.

C. Can be improved in a realistic time frame. For example, I can read books and increase my worldliness, but I'm not going to write a novel for an 8-year payoff.

Women, please let me know what skills, traits or improvements you like to see in a man. I haven't dated in 10 years and at 25 I feel like I'm almost out of time. I'd like to make changes sooner than later. Thank you!!
