Finding girls outside of school
Hello everyone! I am 15 and have been struggling meeting new people outside of school since I go to a small private school. So I was wondering if anyone has any tips for someone to meet people. I donâ€™t have any struggles when it comes to making conversation and all that but I do find it difficult finding people in general. Thanks!
