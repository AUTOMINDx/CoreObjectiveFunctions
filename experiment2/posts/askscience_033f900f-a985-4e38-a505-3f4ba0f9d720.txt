Why were the retro rocket packs on the Mercury capsules painted with silver and black stripes?
For years I thought the stripes were structural ribbing, but I've never been able to find any photos other than simple painted on stripe on the [Mercury spacecraft](https://www.cybermodeler.com/space/mercury/images/nasm_mercury_03.jpg). Why is that?
