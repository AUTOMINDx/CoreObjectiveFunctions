How do I talk in Therapy
Hi! I’ve been in therapy for only two months and I love it but I recently have been paying attention to the way I talk and after my session today it gave me anxiety thinking about how much I just ramble and loosely connect my thoughts or sometimes I have a point I’m trying to make but it gets lost in my rambling and I hate it. I feel like a burden on my therapist because I ramble for the whole hour and always talk about negative stuff even when that’s not what I’m meaning to do.

Is there a proper etiquette to how I should talk? Or am I just overthinking this whole thing?
