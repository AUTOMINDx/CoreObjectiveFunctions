How can I avoid being triggered
I get easily triggered by sad/tragic news or post. As much as possible, I want to avoid those things because it really affect my mood. I suddenly feel sad and sick . 

I recently read a post about a survivor wishing he's dead. I know I cannot control what appears on my timeline . Should I just leave social media completely?
