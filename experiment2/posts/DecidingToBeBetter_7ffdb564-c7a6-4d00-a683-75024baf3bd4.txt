breaking phone addiction if nothing works
So it's a pretty basic situation - I spend too much time online and it's messing with my mental health. But I only ever see advice that doesn't work or that doesn't apply to me.

For example: limiting screen time by putting my phone in another room.. I will just go to that room to get it lol. Things along the lines of "do this so its harder for your monkey brain to start browsing social media " don't work for me. Even if there is a sort of obstacle course I will still do it.

About things not applying to me - an example is that I post my art on instagram and communicate with all my friends there so it would be very stupid of me to delete it.

At this point I even get mental withdrawal symptoms. Also things like associating doing the dishes with listening to a podcast or music which is just a gateway for me to be on my phone for hours until the dishes are done.

Sorry if this post is written weird I have a cold right now but still need advice pleaseee.
