Could you all give me some words of encouragement and positive thoughts I’ve been having a hard time the past couple weeks
Would love some encouragement I’ve been dealing with drug induced dpdr for about 8 months and it’s gotten better but the last month or so I’ve been stagnant in my recovery so some positive words would be appreciated:)
