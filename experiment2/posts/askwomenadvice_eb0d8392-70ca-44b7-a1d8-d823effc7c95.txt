What should I do next time I see her? I don’t know how to ask for her Snapchat without seeming creepy because we haven’t talked a lot but also that’s the only way we can talk more
So there’s a girl I like at work and I have no idea what to do cause it’s a tricky situation. We work at a retail store and she’s always fixing up the store shelves and I’m always on registers, so we hardly ever see each other and when we do it’s just causal “hey” and “bye”s. I got lucky and worked with her on Black Friday but that’s cause they needed extra help on registers. I wanted to ask for her Instagram but didn’t cause she got busy before I left and I had to be somewhere and couldn’t wait around. So now next time I see her she’ll be on the floor. If I by chance catch her one day what should I do? I don’t wanna walk up and it be super awkward but I’m not sure what to say as a conversation starter since we don’t know each other super well. But I also don’t wanna just walk up and ask for her snap. Next time I see her what should I say to ask for her Snapchat?

Btw I’m 17 and a boy and she’s probably between 16-18 of that changes anybodies answer
