megaohm resistor to "pull down" mosfet driver?
so basically i was testing out a basic h bridge inverter circuit, and i had a mosfet driver with the output connected to two of the mosfet's gates. it was a success, the LED's turned on, but when i removed the 5V pin on the arduino, it turned on. i left in both the 5V and ground pin for the input and ground respectively and turned off the arduino, the LED's went dim as the mosfets were clearly shut off. but when the arduino was off and the pin removed, it turned back on. can i just used a 1Mohm resistor between input and ground of the mosfet driver to stop this?
