AITA for removing my friend from our groupchats for a couple of days?
My friends and I are just some teenagers that casually joke about “banging each others moms” and things alike, but recently one of my friends took it too far (in my opinion). He found my moms Instagram, screenshotted her pictures, then zoomed in on her boobs and set them as the picture for the groupchat. He had done other things in the past that weren’t as significant but for me this was the last straw. So I felt it was only appropriate to just remove him from it for a few days but now he’s calling me a dick claiming “it was just a joke”. Am I the asshole?
