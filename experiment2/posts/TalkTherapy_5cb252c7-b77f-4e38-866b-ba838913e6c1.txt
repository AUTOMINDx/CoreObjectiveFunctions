how do I make the time between therapy less horrible/less longing to see my therapist again?
I love therapy. I'm quite attached to my therapist. Frankly, it is the best/my favorite aspect of my life at the moment.

When I realize there's only 2 minutes left in my session, I start to feel down, realizing that I will have to wait for another week to see my therapist again. I live for therapy. If I wasn't going to therapy, I'm not sure I'd be alive. 

Does anyone feel the same or have any tips about what to do so that the time in between therapy isn't so miserable?
