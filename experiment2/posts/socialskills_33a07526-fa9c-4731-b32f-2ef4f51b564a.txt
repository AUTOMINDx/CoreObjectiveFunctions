Rebuilding a good friendship
So I have a situation which im having trouble with. I have made great friends during the pandemic through texting and we got decently close as we started meeting in real life (mostly school, we are classmates in highschool). We used to talk, text and play games together, and both me and them seemed to enjoy it a lot, and we formed a little 3 person friend group in our school.  


It was like that till recently.  
Around one month ago they started distancing themselves from me, and I noticed and asked them about it. They have told me that they feel quite uncomfortable around me and they were overwhelmed by my emotions. Their decision was to distance themselves (to be in more of a classmates relationship than friends) from me due to those reasons. This whole thing has made me quite lonely, since i don't really have anyone else that's close right now, and I prefer less but closer friendships. Since that conversation i decided to take some time alone and go to therapy to understand why they felt the way they did and how i can improve as a person.  
Now i feel like I am somewhat ready to try to improve as a person and to rebuild those friendships, only that I do not know how or if its not too late.  
The bridge is not completely burned. They still sometimes read my texts/look at memes I send, lend me something I ask for, or respond when i talk to them at school. Only that all those things I have to initiate, and they kind of just ignore that im there unless I do something first or if there is a somewhat important matter. 

Should i just slowly try and start talking to them more, focus on making them feel comfortable around me or just give them time?  


I would rather not move on from this, since these people are very important to me, so I wish to at least try my best. Especially that one of those people i have feelings towards, and I really miss spending time with her.
