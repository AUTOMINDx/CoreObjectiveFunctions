[The Fly] Did the fly make Brundle superhuman, or did the telepod?
In Cronenberg’s The Fly, Seth Brundle begins experiencing superhuman abilities after merging with a Common Housefly

We are led to believe this is happening because of the DNA merge offering him the Fly’s abilities such as bug-like strength 

But the trouble is that Brundle specifically says that the machine doesn’t understand organic matter until he teaches it to, which lets be honest, would be a limited “understanding” at best 

So what if, much like the steak, Brundle’s DNA was simply approximated to the best of the machines ability, which logically if a machine was stacking molecules it would do it in the “most efficient” way

Meaning every part of ones body would be optimized, hence the strength, stamina, and agility which all displayed before any fly like powers such as the acid spit and wall crawling 

Was it the fly, or the telepod?
