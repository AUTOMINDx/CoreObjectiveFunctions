So I have a depressed friend. What should I do?
Let me first mention that she isnt clinically diagnosed as "depressed", but she fits every symptom of it according to my observations of her, and i couldnt find a better place to ask advice from.
I have never really been depressed in all of my life, or felt as terrible as she does, and the 6 year age gap between us just makes me worry i cant emphatize with her properly. (I am 14 and she is 20.)

We have been friends for around 2 years. Recently her life has been going pretty badly so she feels way worse than she did before. She already had severe self confidence issues, and they just keep getting worse as of now. She is amazing at writing, but she never likes what she creates now, which makes me sad because in my eyes her works are beyond awesome. I keep telling her that but she just wont listen to me and keeps calling herself bad.

She also stays up a lot too, which worries me because she has lots of work to do already. She needs proper sleep to do them. I first kind of forced sleeping on her, but then I realized that is both mean and wont work, so stopped.

She is kind of forgetful (which i think might be caused from her lack of sleep and depression brain fog), and every time she forgets something she starts insulting and blaming herself over and over again.

I tried to do everything in my power to revert that, such as drawing things she likes and characters from her novel, spending hours praising her (only for her to either reply no u or deny it), and spent almost all of my time with her for the last few months.

I dont really know what should i do anymore, or if i should do anything at all. I have my issues too, like becoming passive aggressive with her to make her accept that she is way better than what she thinks of herself. I stop it and apologize the moment i notice it, but apologies do not turn back time, and that aggressiveness might have just hurt her.

What should I do in this situation?
