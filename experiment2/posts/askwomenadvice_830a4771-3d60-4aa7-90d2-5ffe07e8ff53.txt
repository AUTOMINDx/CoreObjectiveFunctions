trigger warning (sa) how to know if something could be sexual assault
i (college, f) asked a friend to come over at night because i was sad and didn't want to be alone. he suggests that he brings alcohol, i say yes. we play a drinking game, right at the beginning he starts side hugging me and slightly cuddling me, then occasionally grabs my ass really randomly. i'm very surprised but i just go with it. i get drunk very fast, he mentions he isn't that drunk but is a little tipsy. i'm very drunk though. i turn around to drink another shot, he pulls me around and towards him and leans in for a kiss. he has a girlfriend, and i tell him so. but i dont deny it, i say its his choice. so we kiss, and then start making out. we both stop around the same time, he says sorry.

i feel awful about it the second its over. next day, he says that he hasnt seen his gf in a while and was feeling lonely, when i know for a fact he saw her three days before, because he told me so. i bring it up and he denies it. he tells me to keep what happened under wraps and not tell anyone, and that he trusts me to not tell anyone because he knows i value our friendship.

i tell his gf, of course, but nothing happens. she blocks me and they are still together. later i find out that this boy has cheated on previous gfs while drunk with other drunk girls too.

friends tell me that it was his intent all along to get me drunk, and that's why he was being so grab assy from the beginning. i am in complete denial, and dont believe that he would do that, but if someone else told me this happened to them i'd probably feel differently, especially about the grabbing ass part and because i was drunk. i feel like it isnt bad enough to count as sexual \*\*\*\*\* or anything like it, but everyone tells me it does, and i think i need more perspectives on it.
