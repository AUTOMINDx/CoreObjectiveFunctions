Is this even allowed? Using PTO if not given hours
so my wife works at a hospital in the OR. They are discussing cancelling all cases for 2 weeks due to the sky rocketing covid cases in our area. The last time they did this they told people they had to stay home and use their PTO to get paid. Is this even allowed? They are not being given the hours or being asked to come in. Some volunteer to come in and they are denied. any advice? or is this just something shitty that employers can get away with?
