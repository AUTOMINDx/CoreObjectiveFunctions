Asking coworker out a second time?
There's this cute girl(18F) at work I'm(21M) crushing on and i'm wondering if I should ask her out again (we're both uni students and have casual nightfill jobs). 

I'd been talking to her and getting to know her better for a while, which led to some flirting and banter between us. Eventually I ended up asked her if she wanted to have lunch after class sometime. She smiled, said yes and we meetup the next week. We had a good chat for about 1 and a half hours until we had to part ways. I thought it went pretty well, the conversation flowed well and there was a lot of smiling/intense eye contact between the both of us. I texted her after thanking her for the lunch and she replied saying she had a lovely day. 

Still talking and bantering at work. A lot of teasing. Feeling a vibe, about 10 days after our lunch I decided to ask her out ice skating. Unfortunately she couldn't do the suggested day since she had to take her mum to the hospital so a told her to let me know when she's available. Unfortunately to this she replied (in text) 'sure! but I'm also busy with lately with assignments and studying', sounds to me like a soft no.

It's been a few weeks now and she hasn't mentioned it. We still talk and banter at work, and the vibe feels really good, so I'm wondering if maybe I should try ask her out again? If she wasn't a coworker I would be more explicit at just say to her hey I think ur cute I wanna take you on a date, but I don't wanna accidentally make things awkward if she doesn't feel anything. A lot of the time she seems shy until I initiate things (at work) then she acts all playful and easygoing. Maybe she's just friendly and her flirting is just a way of being friendly? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
