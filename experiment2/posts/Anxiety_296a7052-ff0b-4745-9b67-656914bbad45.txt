Do you ever feel like you vent or put too much on someone?
I have really bad anxiety and I feel like I put too much on my boyfriend. I vent to him about things that go through my head. I know that he is always there to listen and he handles my anxiety so well but sometimes I feel bad for him. 

Does anyone else feel like they put too much on someone? 

Please be nice ðŸ˜Š
