They told me I wouldn't be anyone in my life
Before this all happened, I always got along well with my cousins ​​and my sister. 

But after gaining this depersonalization I am unable to interact normally because my mind feels so empty. Thoughts come in only small amounts and that is frustrating. As I don't connect in the same way anymore and as time went by, "I got bored with everything" it made a huge loss in my life. On Sunday, I arrived in the room where we were having dinner and heard about me. 

They started talking about what I've been doing with my life and one of them said that I wasn't going to be anybody in life. This turns out to be somewhat true... 😔☹️
