22F Wants to know if I can workout recovering from Myocarditis and Pericarditis
To give some background, back in the beginning of October I went to the ER with some pretty intense chest pain. After many hours, CT scan, Echo, etc. I was diagnosed with myocarditis and pericarditis. This was due to my second pfizer dose. Since then I have been going to cardiology appointments, and gotten updated blood work + an echo. I was put on Colchicine since the first visit and have been on it since. The latest echo found that the fluid build up as well as the swelling has subsided. Though I am still being left with some pretty intense resting heart rate. ( 120- upper 130's) 

The cardiologist told me to not work out, AT ALL, including walking around too much. I feel out of shape and feel as tough it may be contributing to me getting winded now from doing basic tasks ( I use to go to the gym daily and run / lift )

I mainly just want to know if I really CANNOT go to the gym and do really basic things. (I wont be doing intense cardio or lifting if I do) 

Im still young and was making huge strides on my overall health un till this happened. (I dropped about 20 lbs, I ended up gaining it back post ER, im currently 148 5'4 F22)

Will ligtly excercising really harm me in the way my cardiologist is telling me? I feel like im hurting myself more by sitting around all day. 

Thank you for reading, and I will answer any further questions below if needed!
