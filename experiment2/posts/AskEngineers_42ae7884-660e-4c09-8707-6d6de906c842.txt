Contract engineering position advice needed
Hi all,

I need some input on a contract engineering offer. I'm a BME/ME with about a year of full time medical device manufacturing experience plus ~80% of a master's degree (I will complete it in 2022). I have an offer with a mid-size medical device company in DFW for a 1 year contract manufacturing role with potential to turn full time. The pay is $45/hr and they will let me work remotely as needed on days I have class for my master's (a big plus as my university will only offer in-person, non-evening courses next year). I do not have the contract in writing yet as they are hiring through a staffing agency.

I'm still relatively new to the industry and unsure how negotiations and expectations work for contract engineering roles. So, questions in no particular order:

1. Should I try to negotiate the pay? (It's a significant jump from my total compensation now) Should I negotiate or ask for anything else? Does the hourly seem under industry norms for a contract role? 

2. Expectations for contract roles- would you expect to have around a straight 40 per week? Or less than 40? Sounds like they have a specific project they need support on.

3. Any other comments, anecdotes on the contract aspect, or suggestions? I am just a little leery as I was given an offer quickly and am not sure if it's because of the current jobs market or something else sketchy. Also I am surprised I was offered the position as I am less than a year into a full time position and this is a senior engineer role.

Any input is appreciated, thanks in advance!
