After the heat death of the universe, can quantum mechanics lead to a new big bang?
I was reading the wikipedia article on the heat death of the universe and I saw this:

"Another universe could possibly be created by random quantum fluctuations or quantum tunnelling in roughly 

10^10^10^5610^10^10^56years."

Is it really true? and how likely it is for this to happen?
