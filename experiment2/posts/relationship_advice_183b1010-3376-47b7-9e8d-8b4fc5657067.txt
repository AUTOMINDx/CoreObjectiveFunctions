I blacked out and don’t remember having s*x
A couple days ago, I(f20) was at a kickback with my girlfriend. I didn’t know anyone there but it was all fun and games until I didn’t remember half the night when I woke up. I have a bf and I don’t know how to tell him this… one of the guys at the party told me that we had sex. I don’t want to call it rape but.. is it? I don’t remember what happened or anything. I feel guilty that I let this happen and I’m just confused…
