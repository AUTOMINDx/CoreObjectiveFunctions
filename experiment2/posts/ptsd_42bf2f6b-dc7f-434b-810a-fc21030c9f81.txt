Not sure whether to pursue a trauma therapist
So, I don't think I have trauma but I did have an episode, a breakdown twice. It was 7 months ago for both. TW I think. I threw myself down stairs, banged my head until it hurt, tried to hurt a family member, shrieked til my throat was raw, and tried ripping my hair out. The doctor recommended a trauma therapist after I was evaluated.

Someone said what I experience is PTSD, but I don't think I have it. I thought you need to remember the event to be traumatized. They are a survivor of PTSD and told me that me thinking of when my parents abandoned me even though I was a baby and replaying the imaginary scene over and over was considered trauma. I told them I think about my jaw surgery sometimes too that took a toll on me at 14 years old.

How would I even find a therapist and afford it without parents knowing? I am 20 years old.
