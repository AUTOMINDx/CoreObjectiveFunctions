Recently promoted and nervous to tell my coworkers
I was recently promoted to assistant manager at my job over another coworker who I know has been asking for a promotion and/or a raise. I think it’s mostly because I have more time available and my temperament is a bit more even. I’m confident I can do the job well, but I feel guilty that I was approached and not them, especially because they are struggling to make rent and I’m in a more stable situation. This is my first management level position. I know my coworker will be angry and may even threaten to quit— they had assumed that they were already a manager and talked to the staff about it despite not being told that was their role directly, so it will be a big surprise. Should I let our bosses break the news first, or approach my coworker personally?
