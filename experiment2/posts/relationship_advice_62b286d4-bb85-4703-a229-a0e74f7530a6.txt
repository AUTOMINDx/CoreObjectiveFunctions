Boyfriend asks random girl to comeover the day i was out of town
Well I had a feeling, so I did it…I looked through his phone😅this past Sunday I went to my cousins wedding. Today I looked on his phone to find some messages. The first message from this girl on his phone is her sending him her number…no other messages before that- not to mention that she sent her # a day before the wedding.
Day of wedding- he asks her to “come over tonighttttt” her saying “no you’re gonna bail on me” blah blah blah, then he says “you wanna comeover or want me to comeover? She calls him a couple times 
He says “I’m sorry I fell asleep I didn’t really think you’d hit me back but I’m off tommorow tho lemme know I’ll come over”
Also his ex girlfriend was in his search history on Instagram..as well as a couple other girls..

Is this cheating?…someone help
Idk how to approach this in the morning…he’s sleeping right next to me and I can’t sleep. It looks like cheating to me and sounds like they’ve hung out a couple times.
