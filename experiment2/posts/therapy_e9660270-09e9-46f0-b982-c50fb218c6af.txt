Long time social anxiety+depression + other undiagnosed mental health issues. Should I try therapy again? Anyone similar to me have success moving on with their lives?
I find it very difficult to work due to my anxiety so I can't really do much with my life at the moment. I landed a job but never completed my first day + ended up quitting the same day due to my anxiety. I'm currently on 100mg of sertraline and trying to find ways to cope and get better. I have very bad anxiety, depression and I think i'm on the autism spectrum along with some other MH issues possibly ptsd/trauma. I've had CBT before, tried "mental health" courses and courses where I meet with people weekly to socialize and teambuild but none of this helped me, I think it made it worse to be honest. I hate the feeling that I need to be "fixed" to fit into society but I also know there's no way I can live life this way.

I'm just wondering if anyone has had success with therapy if you were/are in a situation like me. Is it possible to be "fixed" and not have crippling anxiety about everything all the time? I want to be normal :(
