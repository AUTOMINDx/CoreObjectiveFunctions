Are there any philosophers who talk about motion itself as existing separate from the object in motion?
Not looking for the "unmoved mover" per se, but for example, do waves exist separate from water, can the jostling of trees in the wind exist in some way apart from the specific trees that are moving and the specific wind that is moving it, etc. Do those motions, gestures, or what have you, exist unbound from time even though the matter that expresses their movement only exists for a specific amount of time.

Sorry if I'm not explaining this well, I don't any any philosophical training.
