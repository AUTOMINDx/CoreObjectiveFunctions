Declined giving interview because HR was not sure about shift.
I was tired of giving 3 rounds of interviews and then at the salary negotiation getting to know that I am not taking even 5% hike if I join.... So today I asked HR beforehand about salary and shift (I was working rotational and wanted day shift). As soon as she said "I am not sure but sometimes you have to do night...sometime" I said fuck it and declined the interview offer.
