“Capitalism requires a source of slave labor.”
This comment was just casually dropped into polite conversation during a thanksgiving visit.

Where does this come from?  Is this true? (I think it’s easily proven false).

Frankly, I’m tired of extremism and I am still wheeling from this comment.

I know that if I confronted the comment, someone (not me) would have become angered to tears and I would be called stupid and an evil defender of capitalism.

Help.

Edit:  thank you all for commenting on this.  I have a clearer understanding and I’m not as emotionally triggered as when I first posted it.

Learning about all types of slavery instead of just chattel slavery in the USA is very important.

This is an enlightening discussion from all angles - especially those with the cool heads.
