[HIMYM] How did Robin manage to keep her celebrity past secret?
Yeah, it's not uncommon for teen celebrities (especially pop singers who were one hit wonders) to fade into obscurity but there are still going to be people who remember them. I mean Robin was a news anchor, you're telling me that nobody saw her on tv and went "hey she looks a lot like that Robin Sparkles kid." Or any Canadian kids who were die hard fans of hers back in the day never looked her up to see whatever happened to her? Did moving countries make that much of a difference?
