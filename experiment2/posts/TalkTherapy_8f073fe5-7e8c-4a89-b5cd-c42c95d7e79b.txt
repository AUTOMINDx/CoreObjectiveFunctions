Reassurance my therapist doesn’t hate me
I just got out of a session with my therapist which involved me crying about the same thing (again). I get so frustrated with myself that we can’t even just talk casually during the beginning of my session before I just dive into my problems. I feel selfish (lol as I’m paying him for this) and feel like he must get so sick of me. I also feel bad for him having to listen to my same problems and only sees me as this wreck without knowing much else about me outside of these problems. He acts like he cares but that’s his job. Also I called him once on a Sunday when I was suicidal and feel so embarrassed for doing that. Cringing hard.
