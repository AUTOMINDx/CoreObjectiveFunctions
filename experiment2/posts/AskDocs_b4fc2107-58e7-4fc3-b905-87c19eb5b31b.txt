Severe lower back pain radiating to testicles.
Male 33 (white)(6’2”)(165lbs)X-ray in 2015 showed spondylolisthesis in l-5. Did a couple weeks of physical therapy and that helped. Has hurt a little every now and then since then but not like this. I sat in an office chair for several hours yesterday. I stood up and walked around intermittently throughout the day and all seemed fine. The last time I stood up something was different. I couldn’t stand up all the way. Then trying to sit back down was excruciating. I made my way to the bed last night and found sleeping on my left side was comfortable enough to sleep through the night. This morning I thought it was better but then I tried to get up. Putting on socks was impossible. My wife had to do it for me. It took everything in me to get up and take a few steps. Bending at the waist in any capacity is excruciating to the point that I can feel the pain in my testicles. I don’t know what to do. I’m currently stuck in the bed unsure of when or if I’ll be able to get up again. I’m on the mend from a cold and even while lying down every sniffle and cough are excruciating.
