Can morally virtuous actions be subjective to circumstances?
There is an individual that I follow that made the statement that veganism is a morally virtuous action to take on the basis that veganism promotes well being. They personally use the promotion of well being as the foundation for their morals.

The sustainability of dietary choices is incredibly complex and while something may be sustainable and beneficial for some individuals and enviornments, it can be incredibly damaging for other (an example is that some people cannot medically be vegan due to supplements not being fully bioavailable to their body or are unaffordable, while others consume an excess of animal product in their diets and need to reduce or remove animal products from their diets for medical reasons). I struggle with the idea that if someone is unable to partake in an action  that is morally virtuous, that they are not behaving in a good or right way. For instance, what promotes well being for one individual can cause harm for another. Does this mean that, using the foundation of well being for morality, what is good or virtuous is situational and subjective to personal experience?

Also, I'm using veganism because food and animal ethics helps give me context to philosophy as philosophy is a topic I tend to struggle with. I'm fully open to the fact that I still might not fully understand what moral virtues are. I'm just lost and have hit a road block lol.
