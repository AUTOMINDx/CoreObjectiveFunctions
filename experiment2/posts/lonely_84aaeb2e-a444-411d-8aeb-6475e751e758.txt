I will have my Birthday in about 6 Days.
Fuck me.. I don't even know if i can celebrate it, it was always really great or normal. all i really have is my Family which is actually good, but for my selfish ass it seems not enough, and a friend, who I have struggles connecting to on a level, that is anything other than a standart friend who I don't deeply share certain things with, but feel somewhat obligated to because he has no one else, other than a bad family and we also just so had to have a history together with.


I have Family, a Friend, and still feel Lonely, and fucking Miserable, and somewhat just wanting things to be the way they used to be.. maybe I am just the Problem at this point, This post is possibly just a attempt to try to vent.. I can't even live with myself, how am I supposed to get through the one day which usually seemed atleast somewhat important to me, and made me kinda happy.



And the worst part of all this? I can't even tell if my emotions make any sense here. it feels like everyday, something like all of this that i just wrote, is either completely relatable to me, and I feel brutally lonely, or my Mindset/Emotions shifts completly, and I just shrug it off and just feel like as if nothing out of the ordinary happens, and that this is normal, like as if there was no problem.


Like right now, a few hours past, and I can't even tell if I am exeggerating or not, with this post, a few hours ago this made sense, now it feels like I am exeggerating or something, and later it might make me feel lonely again.

I don't know what this post is, at this point I'm sorry for all the people who have to read through all this, because I don't know what the heck I'm doing with my life..
