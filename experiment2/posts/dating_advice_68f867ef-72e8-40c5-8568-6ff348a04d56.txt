What to do with an open mouth kiss?
I’m hooking up with someone who will start with a regular make out then will just open his mouth. It will be like ten seconds of him just with his mouth open and close to mine. It seems like he’s looking for me to do something specific.

I honestly don’t like it, so eventually might try to ween him away from it, but while we’re still in this stage, what do I do with my mouth when he does that?! I have bitten his lip, kissed his neck, pulled away... but do I continue kissing? Not sure how to keep the momentum when this happens.
