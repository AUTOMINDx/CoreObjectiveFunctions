Has anyone's shortness of breath related to anxiety ever gone away completely?
After joining this group, I realized that the shortness of breath I was experiencing that my doctors told me was due to anxiety, was more common than I thought. I got to talk to a lot of people who were also living with the condition and that helped with my mental state. I was just wondering however, has anyone ever grown out of the condition, or is it for life?
