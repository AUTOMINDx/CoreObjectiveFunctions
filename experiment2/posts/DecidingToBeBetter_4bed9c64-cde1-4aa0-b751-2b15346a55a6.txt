Going to put 110% effort in being more positive and trying to change how I live for the better
I was always a drinker/weed smoker, but from 2018 to April of 2020 it got bad. I was very unhappy. I kept away and didn’t keep in touch with friends and family. I felt like my life was falling apart. Then the pandemic began and decided to change. I stopped drinking and smoking for a year. I moved to NC from NY and tried to start over. Sitting here today I’m 20 months sober from weed, but still not feeling right. I’m always thinking negative about myself. I’m stuck at a dead end retail job. I started drinking again. I feel all foggy in my head. I’ve been telling myself today is the day I change, but it never sticks. Today has to be the day that I put all my effort to staying sober. To pointing out the positives instead of being so negative. To work on getting myself physically and mentally better. To hopefully clear my mind and not feel so clouded. It truly makes me feel dumb and hurts my memory and thinking. I need to work at small things that end up adding up to the bigger picture instead of looking at the bigger picture and being defeated on how far and long I need to get there. I always know I need to change, but end up going back to those ways. It’s baffling to me that I know I need to change and what I’m trying to stay away from will hurt me, but still do it anyways. Today has to be the day though where I become stronger. To be able to say no and stay the course. Brick by brick. Day by day. Really hope this is the day. To anyone who’s struggling I wish you nothing but the best. To those fighting and keeping the course, great job. You guys are inspiring. I think that’s all I got. Hope everyone has an awesome day
