Seasonal depression getting in the way?
I’ve been really into this guy for two years. When we first met I was t ready for anything serious and let things fizzle out. He popped back into my life during the springtime and we’ve been hanging out evert since. We’ve been having a lot of fun and haven’t had any arguments or anything. I would love to take things to the next level but over the past 2 weeks or so my seasonal depression has kicked in (I’m coping with it as best I can, I see a therapist, etc). I just feel so heavy all the time and would hate to bring him down as well. I think he’s so wonderful.but I’m not sure I have the energy to give to the relationship that it would need, but I don’t want to lose him. 

What should I do?
