Learning for fun over learning for profit
At what point in life can you just learn things for the fun of it? 
I feel like the majority of my life I have been so focused on learning things that can advance my career and make more money. Which to be fair I have not been very successful with. 
I have been working in tech for about 5 years now. I keep studying to get different IT certifications. But I have to constantly take breaks from it because I lose interest in the subject and want to learn other things. 

I love to learn. But that change of subject always keeps things fresh. 

Right now my employer is requesting I get the Entry Level IT Cert (Comptia A+) but because I no longer see it as a profitable certification since I have work experience now I keep wanting to drop it and focus on an intermediate networking certification (CCNA). 

Then I keep wanting to learn to code but I won’t see profit in that until 1-2 years.

Lastly I would love to sign up for a drawing class. Not for profit but for the fun of it. Growing up I’ve always loved art but for so many years I have been obsessed with studying for profit that I completely gave up on art which I hate that I’ve done that because I still love to doodle during free time. 


We’ll that’s my life story. 
I like tech and it did put me in a position to finally own a home. But studying it does not have the same meaning to me. It’s what I do for a living nothing more. 
The cliche saying of “what would you do with your life if money wasn’t an issue” always comes to mind.
I know I wouldn’t be studying tech. Coding maybe but most likely not IT. 
I’d primarily be studying art, philosophy, and anything else that catches my interest. I’ve been curious about natural energy sources lately so maybe that. 

I honestly don’t know what I’m doing with my life anymore and this is turning into a big rambling session so I’ll just leave it at that.
What are your thoughts?
