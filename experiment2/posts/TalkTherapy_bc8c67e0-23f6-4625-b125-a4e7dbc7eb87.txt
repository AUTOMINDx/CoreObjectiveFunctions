One day I'll learn?
I've been emailing with my therapist because my depression has been really bad lately and my next appointment isn't until next week. We've specifically been talking about my self-hate and negative self-thoughts.

Today I just felt particularly low and she replied to an email with a lot of helpful suggestions and thoughts, but then I read this line

&gt; and as we've noted time and time again together in session, your perception is never the only perception and usually it's a bit rigid.

and my fucked up brain automatically takes the "time and time again" part and starts thinking "Oh she thinks I'm stupid, she's tired of having to repeat herself, I can't even do therapy right and remember things we've went over, etc."

I don't know if she could tell I was upset from my short reply, or if it was a coincidence, but she sent another reply back quickly telling me to please be sure to keep reaching out for help if needed and that she's always happy to help.

Then I realized I was already doing the perception thing and negative thoughts *again* ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

One day....
