What does heterodox microeconomics look like?
Heterodox economics largely focuses on macro.  Some heterodox economists stress macro foundations for macroeconomics.  What about heterodox micro?  Do heterodox economists typically work in macro and then assume most orthodox micro is correct (even if they don't think it serves as a foundation for macro)?
