Insomnia and loneliness combo
So, like many of you, I struggle with insomnia.  Thats not surprising.  But one of the biggest issues is that most people are asleep where I am (EST/EDT).  That fact doesn't escape my anxious brain, which stresses out and frets about the lack of human interaction and contact.   

I get some during the day, but apparently not enough.  

What do you all think I should do to try to make some later night friends?  Look for people on the west coast,  possibly Australia?  How would one even do that?
