Did she want/expect to kiss?
Context: I guess you could call it our first official date. We were at a semi-private environment. After almost 2 hours, she was willing to go to a private space so we went (went from a common area at the dorm to my room). She pointed out the fact that she was going to throw away her bubble gum, and she untied her ponytail.
Although the environment was right and comfortable I believe for both of us, I didn't go for the kiss because she's from a different culture and didn't know how she would take it.

With this limited context, do you think she wanted/expected to kiss?

Before she left she said that she wanted us to meet up again soon.

Thanks
