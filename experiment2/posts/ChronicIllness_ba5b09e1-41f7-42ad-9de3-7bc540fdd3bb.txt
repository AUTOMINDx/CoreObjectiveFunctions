Tired of the judgement
Met someone from an organization today that is supposed to help people with disabilities, mental health issues, etc find employment. I feel like I'm probably not going to be able to manage even some part time work but wanted to give it a go..

She just focused in on my past mental health issues even though I tried saying I'm here for help solely because my chronic pain and issues have been preventing me from education and work. When I tried describing my health issues her first response was "Do you exercise though??" I wasn't expecting it from her so I just said no I'm not able to due to my issues..She comes from a mental health background so once again I feel like she thinks I'm just depressed and not really in pain. 

I'm tired of literally no one believing me or trying to understand when I tell them what my life is like now. I plan to confront her about it the next time we meet but it upset me and I'm experiencing a flareup right now due to being out today for that.
