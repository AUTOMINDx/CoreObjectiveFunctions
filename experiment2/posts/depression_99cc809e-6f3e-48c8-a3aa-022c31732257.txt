I wish he could come back
I lost my big brother last September and I am very sad. I tried talking to people but nothing seems to be helping nobody knows what to say. I cry every single day. It's like my  heart is bursting into pieces every time I think about him. The fact that he is not coming back. I miss him so much. I am depressed and can't get out. Everyday every single second I am thinking about him. I can't even imagine a world without him, I haven't accepted it yet. I can't, I don't want to. It was an accident and they found the body on the third day, we couldn't see the  face because it was covered with white cloth. The body looked nothing like him. He wasn't that tall. I tried telling me that it wasn't him. It's been almost three months and he is not coming back. I wish everything would just go away. We were so close so so close. I miss him. Every time I go to church I pray to god that give him back , or atleast show him when I am dead. He is just 22. He deserved to live. He was in his last year of medical school. I was very proud of him. He is the best brother one could ask for. The way he cared for me from the day I was born, I never thanked him. I never told him how happy and proud I was. I miss you big brother. Your little sister is proud of you. I love you.
