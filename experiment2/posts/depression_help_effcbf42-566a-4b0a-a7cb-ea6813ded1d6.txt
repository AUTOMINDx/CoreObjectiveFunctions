is it normal to have no physical energy while taking meds?
been taking zoloft 50mg daily for about more than a half of year (since May)

I used to be so active, working out/jogging daily, even going  outside doing regular things. Right now I can't work out daily.. even weekly! Feel lazy and with 0 motivation... not even to going shopping or doing the groceries. (I work at home btw)

I talked with my therapist and she told me the reason was because I used to work out as a coping.
