Are the existence of the self and mathematics the only things that we can know with absolute certainty are true?
If you really think about many of the things we say that we know with certainty, we actually don’t. We don’t know with certainty that historical accounts or scientific laws and theories are actually true. We can’t know with certainty that our perception of reality is real. We can only make educated observations for most things. Yet with regards to my individual consciousness, I can know that I am experiencing *something.* Even if it’s an illusion, my consciousness still exists. And with mathematics, e.g. the Pythagorean Theorem, we cannot logically justify rejecting it.
