I feel I don't need friends... something like that
I've been a long time without friends, like 3 years but I feel I don't need them. Yes, I am very quiet and I have a bit of social anxiety, I'm introverted and I don't feel comfortable in large social situations but I'm happy, I prefer to be quiet and I'm happy this way. 

       I know some will say that people need friends and that's totally right, there's a lot of people, not to say most people need friends to have fun, support and enjoy life but I just feel better being alone, I prefer and like doing things on my own. 

       I don't have any friend, any close friend nor acquaintance and maybe is that I haven't find the right person because I use to have friends but all of them left me.    I recently tried, and I thought that I've found the right person but I was wrong. 

       I just don't know if it's that I don't need friends or that I haven't found anyone.
