Do people NOT eat their gingerbread house?
I just read a recipe that tells you to leave the gingerbread house out for 3 weeks then throw it away. Do people really do this? Growing up we always assembled them and ate them within a day or two. I thought that was the point of them. Is it common for people to not eat them? I feel like that can't be true...
