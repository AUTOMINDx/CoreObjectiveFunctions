How do you handle spending money with your SO if you don’t have the same philosophy as her?
ve noticed that my lady of 1 year 2 months and I just don’t have the same philosophy on spending money. She grew up not stressing about money and had a very high tuition completely paid by her folks

I grew up working since I was like 13 years old. Came from a bit of a stressed financial upbringing and paid for my tuition.

I’m 32 now and just received a good paying job and am able to save a bit.

In the end; I still have the mentality of not wanting to get screwed by paying too much for anything or just being more loose with money.

She on the other hand, she’s not frivolous, but her friends husbands buy them expensive things, go out to eat all the time, pay for their vacations, etc..

Yes I do like to take her out but I’m just more humble and don’t like over spending..and she can’t stand it

She gets really stressed..I’d rather save now and spend later..she wants to live like you can die tomorrow in some ways..which isn’t bad..but I’m just not wired for it..

Anybody else relate? How do you navigate this?
