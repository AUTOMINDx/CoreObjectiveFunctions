Just realised how fucced up I am in the head just by being born
Hey so I just realized how bad I really have it mentally, I always knew I was depressed and had a nxiety and some PTSD. But after like 15 or more self-screening tests I realized how serious it actually is. So for some context I have autism and adhd so I have always been harder to raise and deal with. I have been phsyically abused before mentally abused but I am going away from the place that's been mentally abusing me. after new year.

Other than that I am also suicidal and yet I am only 12 years old. (Note I only want to be dm'd if we are gonna talk more than advice)
