[DC] Do superheroes actually reduce crime rates at all?
I'm talking about fictional superheroes in general, not just DC. The goal of a superhero is to reduce crime, but do they actually achieve it? In Nolan's Batman movies, crime actually escalates due to Batman. In captain America: civil war: Vision proposed a theory that the avengers attract more villains. Do superheroes in general reduce crime or does their existence only escalate crime and produce more supervillains? In other words: is [the theory of escalation](http://ltoflevisweeney.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-theory-of-escalation.html?m=1) correct?
