Meal plan
Hi, Iâ€™m trying to give myself a meal plan to heal myself, I wonder if this looks ok &amp; also does anyone have any other suggestions? 

Iâ€™m wondering if I have a gluten/dairy/egg intolerance so really trying to avoid them, along with the usual suspects of tomatoes, citrus, coffee etc (*sigh* I love coffee ðŸ˜¢)

Banana &amp; almond milk &amp; Manuka honey smoothie 

Lunch  
Chicken &amp; green beans &amp; potatoes 
Or 
Fish &amp; broccoli 
Or 
Chicken, white rice, avocado, sweet corn bowl, vegan Mayo 

Snack
Watermelon 

Drinks 
Water 
Camomile tea
