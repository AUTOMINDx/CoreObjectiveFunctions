Where (West) German tourists able to travel unharassed around Europe in the immediate years following WW2?
***Edit: WERE\* - sorry for the typo guys, I just came off hosting a dinner party where I was cooking all day long, I'm tired and prone to making mistakes***

I'm extrapolating from anecdotal stories my Grandpa told me, so please bear with me.

My dad's side of the family are from Singapore and Malaysia, but I'm Canadian and my mom's side are so-called "Old Stock" (read: British) Canadians - so I have a varied perspective when it comes to World War 2 because both sides of my family had different experiences.

So my Grandpa and Grandma, who lived through the Japanese occupation of Malaya and Singapore, told me stories of their youth - that when the Japanese economy picked up in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Japan was becoming a strong middle-class society that could afford to travel overseas - mostly in Asia.

They (my gparents) told me that these tourists received less than warm welcomes in places like  Korea and the Philippines, where the Japanese Imperial Army committed brutal acts during the war, as the community hadn't moved on from the trauma of being occupied. My grandpa (who had to leave school to avoid conscription into the Japanese Army because they were turning Singaporean schoolboys into child soldiers) even went so far as to tell me that in high school, he and his schoolmates would pelt Japanese tourists with sand to get them to leave the area in Sentosa Beach.

Assuming that this was a widespread enough phenomenon, and the same also applied to Europe/ Europeans still feeling the same resentment toward West Germans in the years after the war - could you, a West German traveler, visit places like France and the Netherlands without being harassed by embittered locals?

Also, what was it like being a German tourist in Europe in the immediate aftermath of WW2 generally? (in the 1950s and 1960s)

Thanks in advance for answering my questions!
