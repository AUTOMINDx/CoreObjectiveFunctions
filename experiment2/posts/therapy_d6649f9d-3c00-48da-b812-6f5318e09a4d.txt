Starting therapy at an OCD treatment center and I'm extremely nervous.
I've been in therapy for years for ptsd, and BPD, but recently reached out to an OCD center since where I have been going doesn't have an OCD specialist. The treatment I've done has helped with my ptsd and bpd a lot but my OCD is now my primary concern. I'm worried treatment here could cause me to backslide or lead to something bad happening. If I hadn't made so much progress and wasn't so scared of how I was before my progress I don't think it would be a problem. Has anyone here had OCD specialized therapy? Is it intimidating?
