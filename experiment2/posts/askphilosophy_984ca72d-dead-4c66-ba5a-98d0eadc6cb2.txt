Are Mathematical Truths Necessary A Posteriori Truths?
In order to conceive numbers, don't I first have to experience contact with objects of similarity (let's call the category for these objects category X) and count them through consciously or subconsciously isolating those objects and ommiting non-X objects from the calculation?

In other words, can numbers exist in a vacuum? Or do they need to be abstracted through a process identifying similarities between particulars and establishing a multiplicity of repeated occurrences in reality?
