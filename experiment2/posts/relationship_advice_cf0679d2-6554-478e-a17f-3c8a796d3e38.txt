Should I break up?
I love my girlfriend. She's one of those people that are just super attractive, smart, responsible but she's not putting effort in our relationship. It seems like she has so many other things to worry about like school, friends, and work leaving no time for me. However, I too have friends, go to school and work. I have plenty of time. She's never free to hang out and when she is, always has the desire to cancel on me because going out is simply too much work. She's always calling her "boy bestfriend" and making plans with him. She would never cancel on him I'm told. He also has a girlfriend. It has come to the point where I see her maybe only once or twice a month. 
She also doesn't like showing affection, hugging is the peak of what'd shed do. She is emotionless when I do anything nice for her like buying food or helping her do something. She doesn't call or text first. She doesn't always pickup my calls and replies to my texts very slow. I do a lot for her but it is never reciprocated. 

Is she not into me anymore? Is there a point in staying in the relationship? Is this just how she shows love?
