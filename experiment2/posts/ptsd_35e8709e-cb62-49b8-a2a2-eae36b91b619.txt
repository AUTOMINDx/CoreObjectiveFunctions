Was feeling fine, now i’m feeling angry
I’ve been working really hard so I can heal. For the past few months, I felt like I was achieving it. 
Today I got really mad cause I saw something that reminded me of my trauma and the fucking piece of shit that helped creating it.

I don’t want to be angry again. How do you guys work through relapses?
