How can I quit a job that isn’t working out?
I can’t even give it another chance, the conditions are cold and hazardous both literally and metaphorically. It’s like working in an ice box with a bunch of ice kings and queens. Not to mention I have a medical condition they caused with their inconsiderate incompetence. 

I need to get out of here, but I don’t know what to say or how to tell them I don’t want to work for them anymore. I don’t think they’d even care if I left.
