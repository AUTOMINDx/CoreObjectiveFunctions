I Left.
I made a post on here about a discord server I was in for a long time (like two years) and deleted it, but some comments helped me realized just how toxic the environment was. The group in charge of the server are a fucking clique neck deep in high school type bullshit and I think they just use the server to parade themselves around and show off. 

Not to mention, they do that fake nice shit, where they say they love and care about you but wouldn't give you the time of day, even when you've done it for them (and boy have I done stuff for them and for the server that I didn't fucking have to, just because I felt it was the right thing to do). I'm not saying I'm owed anything, because I'm not (no one is), but don't say you love and care about me when you never talk to me and will never talk to me. 

So, I silently left. I unfriended and unfollowed the lot of them. Good fucking riddance. 

But now, here I am, alone again....naturally.
