How to stop thinking I wasn’t good enough for him?
I met this guy 4 months ago. He was my first partner. We weren’t exclusive because for years he had been seeing and sleeping with lots of girls and said he never wanted to be in a relationship again, he said he didn’t feel anything for anyone and that it would never change. He was extremely kind with me. But he told me that our relationship would never evolve.

Tonight he just told me that he wanted to try to be different. That he had met someone. And that he wanted to try to see only her. But he says he would like to see me, but he would rather not, but he wants to continue talking to me. I gave him everything. And all I can think is that this girl is better than me. He just met her but he wants to give their relationship a chance. How can I stop thinking I wasn’t good enough for him? What did I do wrong? It hurts. So bad.
