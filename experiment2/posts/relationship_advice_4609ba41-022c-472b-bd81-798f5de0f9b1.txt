Dating someone you don’t see yourself marrying down the road?
My (21F) boyfriend (22M) of 11 months got back together a day after we had a mutual breakup about not seeing each other in our futures

My boyfriend and I have talked about our future before if we see growth for the future and we have said yes. However, I deep down have always thought he was good for now and I do not logically see him as a long-term boyfriend who I can marry (different values, different ways of arguing, I’m goal driven and he’s not). I always told myself we will cross that bridge when we get there, we are young, and people change. I do love and care for him deeply. My mom has always said he’s not right for me and I always tell her to let me enjoy the now. 

Last night, he said his father said the same thing about me not being the one he will marry even though his father loves me. And then my boyfriend said deep down he agrees. After being on the same page, I said I stood where I’m enjoying our now and what we have because nothing lasts forever. He said he wants to be with me, loves and cares for me but it will gnaw at his brain that we aren’t for the future and he couldn’t do it. It ended mutual and we were both crying. 

This morning, I came to acceptance of the end and was actually laughing at the situation and it was not as bad as I thought it was. I did cry a little but I detached from a scarcity mindset. Then he calls me and says he fucked up, takes back what he said, and realized he doesn’t want to be without me and wants to enjoy the now. We are back together. But now the breakup and situation is constantly in my head. 

What do I do? It doesn’t sit right with me that he had to lose me in the first place to realize what he had. It also makes me sad that we both know we won’t last. I don’t know why my mindset is different now compared to before we talked about it.
