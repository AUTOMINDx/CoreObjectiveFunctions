Examples from the past of currencies or commodities that burst?
I’m interested in Bitcoin and new to economics.

It’s interesting that Bitcoin is a totally virtual construct yet is genuinely valuable (in terms of being able to purchase goods) so long as everybody else values it (which is true for any form of capital, I guess).

I’m curious, any interesting examples from history of a bubble like this emerging, then bursting - people losing their wealth because the value of their asset disappeared overnight?

Thanks
