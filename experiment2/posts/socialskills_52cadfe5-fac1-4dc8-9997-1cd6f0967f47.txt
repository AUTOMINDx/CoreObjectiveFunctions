How do I get out of my sisters birthday without looking bad? I have social anxiety and even the thought of it is giving me so much anxiety.
My sister wants to go to a club for her birthday, my siblings are going and some family. They've all assumed I'm coming and got me a ticket. I want to celebrate with her but the thought of it is making me sick. I really dislike clubs, I don't dance and then feel awkward the whole night and get pressured into dancing and feel uncomfortable, get upset and want to leave. I need a good reason to not be able to go, I'm considering pretending to be sick the night before but i have plans the day before I'm meant to go that I can't cancel so I'm not sure if it'll work.
