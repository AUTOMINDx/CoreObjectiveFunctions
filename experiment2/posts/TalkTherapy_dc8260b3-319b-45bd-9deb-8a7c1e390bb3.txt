Trouble finding therapist?
Is there a better way to find therapists who have openings and take Medicare/Medicare advantage plans? I’ve googled and reached out to over 15 through psychology today, and am at a loss. They’re either not taking patients or don’t take my insurance. I’m struggling despite meds my pcp has put me on and feel like I’m out of resources.
