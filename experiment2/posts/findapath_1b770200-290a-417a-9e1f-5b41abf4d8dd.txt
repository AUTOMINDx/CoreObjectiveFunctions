Remote job options in social services?
I am curious to know if anyone knows of any remote jobs out there for reputable companies that provide mental health/social services. 

I am currently working as a substance abuse counselor. I have done this for two years. I will be receiving full licensure for my Texas LCDC in April. I have a multidisciplinary bachelor degree where I mainly majored in substance abuse and psychology, but I also minored in human resources because it was something I was interested in as a fallback. I love my actual job role but I am starting to hate the company that I work for. On top of that, I am having my first baby in March and am just curious about my options. TIA.
