Why is "hand-breaded" marketed as being "better" than machine-breaded?
At restaurants they make sure to make a big deal of their "hand-breaded" chicken tenders or whatever, and all I can think of is that it'll be uneven because a machine could do it more uniformly. And wouldn't machine-breaded be cheaper to make anyway? Why is it pushed so hard as the better option?
