When is love not enough?
I have been dating my boyfriend for a year. I love him *very* much, but sometimes I wonder if we are incompatible. 

We are very different. He is social and outgoing, I am reserved and introverted. He is competitively athletic, I enjoy more relaxed workouts and hikes. 

We live together. We talk about having a family. But there are times when I feel like I want to leave in the night and never return. 

Because even though he loves me, sometimes it feels like he doesn’t *like* me. 

For example, tonight I made pasta. I told him it had some bacon in it (he loves bacon) and was kind of indulgent - because pasta. He asked me why I made it that way (he’s eaten it before and loves it) and that pasta is supposed to be *simple*. I told him he could wash off his pasta and eat it plain, then went and took a very long shower. He came into the bathroom and said, 

“You’re not going to eat with me?” 

I told him I lost my appetite. He scoffed and shut the door. 

A few days ago he made a comment about how I am impulsive when it comes to spending money (he said this because I don’t always stick to a list when shopping and sometimes I like to spoil our dogs with treats/toys) but then goes and buys a $200 air fryer (he doesn’t cook) and a $650 watch. 

He asked me to purchase something expensive for him on Amazon - before I did, I asked him to review it twice to make sure it was exactly what he wanted. He confirmed. I ordered. It arrived today and it’s not the right one, even though it’s the one he approved. He said it’s not my fault but in a way that still feels like it is something I should have been aware of. 

It’s always *little* things like that. A rude comment or remark that’s not big enough to react to - and if I do, I’m overreacting and need to calm down. I love him but this kind of shit makes me wonder if we would be better off as friends. 

What do you think?
