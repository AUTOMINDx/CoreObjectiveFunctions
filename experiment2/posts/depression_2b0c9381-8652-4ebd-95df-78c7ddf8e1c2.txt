Why me? I put my all into people just for them to not give a fuck about me. Why me?
All my fucking life I’ve tried to be my best to everyone that I love. I’m always there for someone who needs me. I’m there for someone who doesn’t have anyone else to go to. I’m always there but no one’s ever there for me, no one’s ever there when I need them. What did I do? I try my absolute best to be there and in the end I’m the one who gets fucked over. I’m just so tired of this. WHY ME LIKE HONESTLY WHY. IS THEIR ANYONE OUT THERE WHO ACTUALLY HAS FEELINGS?!? Is their anyone out there who’s like me? Is there anyone else who feels like no one cares about them but they care about everyone? Why me? I’ve always been fucked over by the ones I love. I can’t talk to my best friends about it because I get ignored by them constantly. I’ve been trying to make new friends but it hasn’t been working out to well. I just want to be happy again. I want the color in my life back. I want someone to love me they way I’d love them. There has to be someone out there. I just don’t get it. Why me?
