Are there any cultures with more than three genders?
As far as I understand it, most cultures either have two genders correlating to sex, three genders, or they just think people are more or less "manly".  
  
Are there any cultures that have even more genders than three? Or maybe even less than one?  
  
Also I'm aware I've probably got a very western view of "gender" here so I'm happy to be educated on how different cultures view the concept!
