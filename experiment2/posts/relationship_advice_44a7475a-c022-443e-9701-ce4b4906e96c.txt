I [35F] think my son [17M] is dealing drugs.
I’ve suspected this for a while now but I’m still at an absolute loss how I approach it. I wouldn’t know how to handle it if he really was and I wouldn’t know what to say if I falsely accused him.

A little bit after we bought him a car last year. He started leaving the house more and more. Which wasn’t much of a surprise even though he used to barely go anywhere. As more and more time has passed, he’s become more on edge all the time. And he tries to cover it with some fake masculine bravado or just straight anger. His younger siblings look up to him so much but he’s been borderline abusive to them lately. It’s like he’s scared of something. 

He’s also seemingly getting money from nowhere. He does have a job, but the type of things he’s doing wouldn’t be affordable even if he saved every penny. He just says he’s been saving over the years and finally decided to spend it. But I’m not buying it, he has concert tickets and a brand new pair of $200+ shoes every other week. 

He’s also been sneaking out at night. And when he does tell us where he’s going, it’s always “a party” our son wasn’t one for parties before but now he’s going to someone’s house every weekend.

All this just points to one thing and I don’t know how to handle this. I don’t know what to say or do. What can we do about? How do we make sure he’s safe? I feel like I’m failing as a parent. What would drive him to do something like this? Him and his siblings don’t get every single thing they want but we don’t have any type of money issues.
