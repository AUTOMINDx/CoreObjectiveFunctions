Q: Energy monitor VS Electricity Monitor
Hi all,

Is there any difference between energy monitor and electricity monitor? 

# Context

Recently, my electricity bill has gone up. To find out the why, I have decided to install a plug to track my appliances electricity usage. After much research, I came across energy monitor plug vs electricity monitor plug. 

However, I am unable to find ***what is the pros and cons of it***.  

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
