[GA] Criminal background check after company acquisition
Hi all,

I have been employed at my current job since the beginning of 2021. Over the last 2 months we have been acquired by a larger company and asked to complete a criminal background check. In June I had an incident where I was arrested for possession of marijuana, which was a misdemeanor. I was placed in a pretrial diversion program as it was my first offense. I have completed all parts of the program and am set to be removed from the program in January.

During the background check I was asked if I was currently on a pretrial diversion or probation in which I answered yes. Since then I've gotten an email that requested the state/county of the incident but says providing further details was optional. I now have an HR guy at the new company calling me requesting to know what the actual charge was. I politely declined and let him know I provided the required information in the email and did not want to disclose what the charge is. I am now getting push back and was told I can be terminated if I do not disclose the charge.

Is it absolutely mandatory I disclose this? The background check they did does not show any charges on my record. I don't want to risk being fired and would honestly rather resign and just find other work especially with the diversion program ending in January. Just looking for advice here ty
