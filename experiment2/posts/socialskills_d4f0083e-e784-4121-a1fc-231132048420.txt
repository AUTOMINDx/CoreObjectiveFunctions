How do I adjust my speech tone and talk much fluently.
I canâ€™t speak with a solid tone, it appears to me that I have held on multiple tones and speech styles throughout my childhood, and I currently keep switching between them as I speak with people, which does put me in a very weak position and a major disadvantage when it comes to making friends and being social.

I also keep crashing especially when there are much thoughts going around and the conversation is fast-paced.
