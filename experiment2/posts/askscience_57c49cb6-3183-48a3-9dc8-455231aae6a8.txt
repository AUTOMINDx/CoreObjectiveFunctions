Why are lilies so lethal to cats?
Hi r/askscience,

I searched the sub for posts on this topic and didn't find anything - forgive me if I've missed something and it's been answered previously. Additionally, my question is veterinary medicine-related, but I wasn't sure if chemistry or medicine would be a more appropriate flair, so apologies if it's not labeled appropriately.

My tough lil' adopted street cat is currently in the vet ER for lily exposure. I was given a bouquet of lilies as a gift, which my cat sniffed and scratched at briefly yesterday. After an internet search and consulting veterinary poison control, I came to realize that lilies are not simply "toxic if ingested" - they are apparently **incredibly lethal** to cats even in tiny quantities. According to the [FDA](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiK6c7I9cP0AhXdQjABHWmRApEQFnoECAQQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fanimal-veterinary%2Fanimal-health-literacy%2Flovely-lilies-and-curious-cats-dangerous-combination&amp;usg=AOvVaw2iBIECKABU21Vkk-twGP02), a cat just "licking a few grains of pollen off of its fur" can cause lethal kidney failure.

I have a bachelor's in chemistry and can understand some of the PubMed results for research on the topic, but I'm wondering if anybody here has more expertise in this subject and can explain just **why lilies are so devastatingly toxic to domestic cats.** Are there any accepted or likely theories on the subject?
