Survey on reading journal articles via audio
Hi,

I'm currently working with a team to help those who need to read and understand published journal articles. - In short, making the articles available to listen to, in addition to reading.

I'd love to get people's opinions on such a product (So please comment!) and I have a 2min survey to understand more about the reading habits of students academics and researchers. Could you share?
