My Therapist stopped practicing and I'm having trouble finding a new one
I've (F/26) been going to therapy for almost a decade now-started when I was 17. I've been through a handful of therapists but found one that clicked with me perfectly when I was about 20. She knew how to handle me, and our personalities matched together super well. It was almost like she was a best friend that I hired lol. Even when I moved to a different country, moved back, and went through quarantine, she stayed with me via Skype. However, due to the pandemic, she decided to stop practicing since her children were having trouble with zoom school. I understand, and I'm not mad, but I'm certainly sad. We had our last session in September (I didn't even know it was our last session until we were halfway through! And she had to leave early because of an emergency!!). I've been trying out a new woman from the office that my psychiatrist works from, but she *really* isn't cutting it. She hardly says anything and gives the most basic advice (*have you tried deep breathing?* I've been doing this for 10 years-OF COURSE I HAVE). I'm on Medicaid right now through Maryland Health Connection. I'm a bit frustrated and lost when it comes to finding someone new. I don't really know where to start or what to look for. Since I've been with my last therapist for so long, this is the first time I've had to do it on my own.
