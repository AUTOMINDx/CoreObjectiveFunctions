Help finding a work from home job paying $20+/hr
I've been working at Amazon for a year now, pretty much only because I can't find anything in my field and it paid more than food service

However I'm trying to either move up in the company or find something elsewhere paying more.

Indeed and LinkedIn sucks, I don't have any connections (yet), and I don't have a car so my commute sucks.

Would anyone be willing to share their ideas with me so long as it's not phone calls/sales? Tried it, not at all good at it plus I don't like relying on commissions
