Are there any apps for people who just want chat therapy?
I’ve used BetterHelp, but most of the therapists want me to schedule a video or phone session. I would prefer a session of chatting. Or being able to just send them a couple messages throughout the week and have them respond when they can. Vs having an hour long or however long live session once a week. 

Recently, my schedule has been so hectic with work that I haven’t had time to schedule a live session with the new therapist they matched me with. I have sent her a message worth an issue I have. Her response was to schedule a session and that video or phone is preferred. I haven’t scheduled a session yet. But she hasn’t reached out to check in or anything, and it’s been over a month since we’ve been matched. 

I’m looking for someone who can respond to my issues via chat when I’m unable to schedule a live session. The ability to message your therapist whenever is a feature of the app (and the main reason i signed up), but I’ve found most of the therapists don’t want to talk via chat. Only live video or phone sessions.
