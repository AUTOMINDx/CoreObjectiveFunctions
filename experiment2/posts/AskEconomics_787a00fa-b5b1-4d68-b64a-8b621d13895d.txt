What is the metric I should look at when negotiating my annual raise?
There are different numbers being thrown around in the context of how bad inflation is. My question is trying to cut through the noise: my job hands out annual cost of living raises. Last year my raise was 2% because I'm already at the top of my job's pay band, which sucked but inflation was at 1.4% so I was willing to roll with the punches a bit.

Is CPI data the right metric to base my argument off of? And if so, can I just glance at this chart to see where it is come year-end? [https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/)

Am I correct in making the argument that anything below the percentage here (currently 6.2%) is effectively a pay cut or is that an exaggeration?

Thanks for helping me to wrap my head around inflation in the context of my salary.
