[Metal Gear Solid V] Quiet shooting the blades of the helicopter
There is a cutscene in the game there Ocelot gives Quiet his gun and she shoots through the moving helicopter blades a few times to prove that she’s capable (I guees). 

Now, shouldn’t it be more difficult to actually hit the spinning blade rather than miss it?

My points are:

a) There are like four blades and at any given point of time they at best occupy only 10% of the space above the helicopter; 

b) While they rotate pretty fast the speed of the shot bullet is much-much higher;

c) Rule of thumb is: the faster the target moves the harder it is to hit it.

So by my logic, it really should be more impressive to consistently hit the blades. There should be some math to prove it.
