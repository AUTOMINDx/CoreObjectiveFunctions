Want to learn how to smile
I know this sounds stupid, but I’ve no idea how to smile without it seeming fake. I’ve had bad teeth for a long time and have finally gotten them fixed. I feel better and I think I look better but with my teeth being as bad as they were I never smiled. Now I would like to but not sure how to make it look genuine.
