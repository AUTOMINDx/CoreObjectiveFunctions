Guilt trip
See previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultChildren/comments/r3wyws/boundaries_are_hard/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

My mom is homeless. She texted me last night to let me know she is using her last bit of money for a motel room. I maintained my boundaries, and got the guilt trip. I cried myself to sleep.

This morning she begged me to buy her another night. I paid for the room until Friday and gave her a number for housing assistance. 

I know it's not my job to fix it. I know I'm enabling her, perpetuating the pattern where I'm the parent and she's the child. I just can't stand the thought of her dying on the street.

I'm not sure if this is to vent, or for advice, or what. I just need to not feel alone. And for my therapist to answer my email...
