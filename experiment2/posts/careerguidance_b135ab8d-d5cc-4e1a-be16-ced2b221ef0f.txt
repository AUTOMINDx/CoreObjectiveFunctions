Am I being too picky?
Let me preface this with saying I left my job in August because I was being overworked. I was working 6 days a week, 10 hours a day with no PTO. Or time off in general. So I’m looking for a remote job that values work/life balance. I also have a chronic pain disorder and it gets worse with stress. What’s best for me is a job that will care about me as a person… but is that even out there?

I’ve interviewed with a few companies now and disliked most of them for one reason or another. One told me straight up that they don’t offer good PTO, one told me the company needs to come before my personal well being (essentially). I always ask “how do you keep employees motivated and have good work life balance” and they usually straight up say “we don’t”. I’m starting to feel hopeless and just want to settle for a job that once again will burn me out because the search has been hard. Will I ever find a position where I feel like the company has good work life balance, or am I being too picky? 

Also, I’ve been seriously looking since late September and it’s currently late November. Do I just need to give it more time? I left my job in august, how much time do I have before my gap becomes a problem?
