How to find or make for myself a safe, accepting, loving environment?
31 male here.

After moving in with my aunt where i felt safe, trusted and understood, I started to make alot of progress with my trauma. I was going out and challenging my self socially, I started reading alot of books on the subject of trauma, I was journaling and really practicing all the techniques my therapist was giving me. I was identifying old thought patterns and replacing them with new ones. I was building myself a new foundation and really rediscovering myself.

sadly my aunt (unknowingly) triggered me by expressing her lack of trust in my progress and started making her own requirements of me. Ever since, staying with my aunt has not felt safe, or secure like it once did. That magical feeling of complete trust, like I was really being given the time and space I needed to rebuild myself: it all slipped away in the span of a day and my progress ever since has slowed to a snails pace.

looking back, I never realized how powerful a tool it was to feel that sense of safety, security, and trust. I cannot deny how crucial it was/is to my healing. That sense of safety was really being absorbed by me and integrated into my psyche as a place to fall back on. But because I was/am so sensitive to any form of doubt, all my progress feels like it got taken away.

How can i get that "motherly" love back? How can I make it for myself? Is that even possible? Is there anywhere i can go, or anyone out there that can say "I don't know what your going through, but I believe that you want to get through it. Here, you can take all the time you need to get back on your feet. I believe in you"

How can i make that feeling for myself?
