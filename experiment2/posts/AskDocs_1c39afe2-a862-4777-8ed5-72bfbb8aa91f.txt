Sleep apnea or anxiety?? I REALLY need advice please.
I’m a 23 year old female, 5’5 153 lbs. for the last year or so, when I’m falling asleep, I wake up 5-10 times gasping for air. Sometimes it feels like my throat is closed, sometimes it just feels like I stopped breathing, but every time I’m out of breath and panicking and genuinely feel like I’m dying. it keeps me awake for hours. I always sit straight up grabbing at my throat not being able to breathe for a few seconds. My heart races. It used to happen to me maybe once a year but now it’s EVERY single night. I have tried to get a sleep study from 2 different doctor’s and was denied by both because I don’t fit the criteria for sleep apnea (I don’t snore, not overweight, normal blood pressure, etc.). I’m feeling very scared and discouraged. Every time I go to sleep I’m afraid I won’t wake up in the morning. What does this sound like? I don’t think it’s hypnic jerks because it happens EVERY night several times a night. Maybe GERD? Maybe post nasal drip? Maybe anxiety? Or does this sound more like classic sleep apnea? I would appreciate Any and all advice please and thank you
