Im not sure what to do with my current problem M(17)
My whole life i have been looked down on because im different, that is because i have pretty bad adhd and lack alot of social skills. I have been trying to get a girlfreind before i go out of highschool, but every girl i talk to will just stop talking to me or not like me. A main reason is because i suck at texting and work too much at my job. I have bad luck at work and in school and woth girls, im not sure what to do. Frankly this all has caused depression, on top of that my family life isnt the best my siblings are heavily abusive. Im afraid of being medicated for my adhd because idk what it will do to me. Should i see a therapist and a doctor about veing medicated or should i just go on with my semi controlable adhd and depression.
