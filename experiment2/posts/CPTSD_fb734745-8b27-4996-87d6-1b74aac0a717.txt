Did anyone else have a parent use child you as a pawn? My heart aches every day over my mother keeping me from my dad growing up.
I’ve been digitizing camcorder tapes that my dad took of the first 10 years of my life. His unconditional love for me breaks me to pieces. Instead I was assigned to my mother, a narcissist alcoholic who told me she was too selfish to love me. She blamed me every day for “ruining” her life. I spent my childhood cooking and cleaning and raising her children. My dad didn’t (and doesn’t) know what she put me through. 

Yet in these videos I see a glimpse of the life I should have had. My dad looked at me like I was the greatest blessing this world had ever seen and he was the luckiest man to ever live. I’d get to see him when he could send her money, which was not often. He lived in friends’ basements to send her money, which she spent on drugs and alcohol. I’d see him maybe once a month. He would work 12 hrs night shift, drive 5 hrs to pick me up, drive 5 hrs back, then play with me until I nodded off. 

I mourn for the both of us, my father and I. It’s times like these that I feel so broken through and through.
