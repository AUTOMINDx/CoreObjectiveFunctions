I am in utter confusion and don’t know what to do
I don’t know what to do and can really seek help from you guys. I have just finished my graduation
The problem is I enrolled into an accounting professional course (ca) in 2019 (there are Total of 3 levels) cleared my first level examination and then due to pandemic, my procrastination level hit new heights and I haven’t studied for the examination since
I have been justifying this by telling myself that yolo but instead of going on a adventure I end up sitting on my couch the whole day watching Netflix and wasting my time 
I haven’t learned a single new skill in these past 2 years
I know I want to peruse my education but I am not able to find any motivation to study, not even to open my books 
Now I am in big dilemma whether to stop my study and should go look for a job since I am still living under my parents roof 
I should also mention that I do have a great interest in marketing and business development so I’ll be searching for a job in that field 
Please help me out 
TL;Dr:-I messed up 2 years of my life and I don’t know what to do now
