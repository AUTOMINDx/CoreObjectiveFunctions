About to graduate with an Agribusiness degree but hate it. Interested in Comp Science
Hello,

I am about to graduate with an agribusiness degree soon and I don't fancy the idea of working in the Agricultural world at all. I chose this degree because I did not know what I wanted to do in school at 17 years old and I could not drop out due to family standards so I chose Agribusiness because it seemed easy.

For the past 1-1.5 years, I have been interested in computer science/computer engineering and I can spend hours listening to topics related to it but with Agribusiness, it is painful to sit through a 1-hour discussion. I was too scared to change majors because I felt like I had already invested time and money to the agribusiness degree and now I regret that.

I work for an ag-tech company as a salesperson part-time but I dread it because this is not what I like. I like problem-solving, creativity, and analysis and I have recognized I am not a salesperson or business person. I graduate next year and my plan was that I would take a year off to "re-calibrate" or enjoy life and then go back to school for a bachelor's in computer science. Currently, during my off-time, I try to learn the basics of coding, and app development has been catching my eye.

I would appreciate any advice regarding this situation and if it helps, I live in Canada, so if you know any special resources that would be beneficial for me, please feel free to mention them. Thank you guys and stay safe
