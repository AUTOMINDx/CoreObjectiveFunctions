Not having a political party to lean on is a dealbreaker for folks and potential dates and I'm completely fine with it.
The last 18 months was a big shift. I shouldn't have to lie or pander for validation or to keep a friendship that was slowly diminishing any way. Why do I have to follow what you believe in order be your friend or find a potential partner? People can simply disagree on things without disrespecting one another but you hardly see that in today's society.

If you can't deal with your partner not liking your president or religion, either deal with or break things off now and punch a pillow or something.
