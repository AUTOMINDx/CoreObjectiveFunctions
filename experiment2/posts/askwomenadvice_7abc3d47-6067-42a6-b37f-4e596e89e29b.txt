Update: my ex wanted me to move out of state with him but asked for me to get my own place
Update: 
I appreciate everyone for their input and advice. All of it gave me an objective outlook on the situation and it helped me a lot. 

I thought I was done but after some thought I decided to reach out to him to end on good terms. I know y’all are probably thinking I’m stupid for doing so but it’s not in my heart to leave things on bad terms. Life is entirely too short and he’s been such a pivotal person in my life. We’re planning to talk today and I want to find some type of closure from this. What questions do y’all think I should ask that will help me with this?

Update #2:
The call didn’t go that well. He seemed very over the situation and said that he sees no short term future for us, but he does see us together long term (that doesn’t make sense whatsoever but whatever). He said the way I handled the situation showed him that I’m a lot more immature than he thought and I was acting like I was in high school. Which is fair, I could’ve handled the situation a lot better by just internalizing all those feelings and not taking it out on him. He’s refusing to see me before he leaves bc I “don’t get to pick and choose when he’s the asshole” and that it wouldn’t be beneficial for either of us, which hurts so fucking much. He said we were on good terms but that call just made me realize it’s time to move on for good. 
Thank you to everyone who gave me their honest input.
