How to explain yourself to someone who already has a story in their mind about you?
A superior wrote some things about me for my evaluation based on knowing only a small part of the stories. It seems they already have a story in their mind about me. It said something I said was not true, when it was. I don't want people to think I am a liar. It also said something about how I did not get along with others, which distorted the situation. As it was shared with others, I would like to stand up for myself and write an explanation back to everyone.

Do  you have any advice on how to effectively write something to explain myself when someone already has a story in their mind about you? Writing  is the only way I can contact this person at the moment.
