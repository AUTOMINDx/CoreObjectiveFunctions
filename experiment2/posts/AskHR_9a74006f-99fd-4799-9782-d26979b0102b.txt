[UT] former employer trying to bill me for PTO months later
left a company after I felt I had no choice in a toxic environment. Before leaving, I had several days of vacation and sick time left. I printed out the remaining balance on my last day from their PTO approval software. You have to select a date, and it shows you the accrued time on that date. So if my last day was 06/30/21, my printout shows that on that day, I had leftover PTO in the positive.

A while after I left, I received a message saying I had used some non-accrued PTO and would need to pay it back. However my printout shows this is not true. It lists several days left of time on my last day. The company's retort was that the system wasn't correct and the info shown was the "total available to use whether it had accrued or not." Though they couldn't explain what that meant. If it hadn't accrued, how was it calculating that number? You select a date and it shows earned time that hadn't been used yet on that date.

All my PTO was approved in the system which goes through manager and HR approval. There was never any email or message saying I had used non-accrued time. I never purchased time from the future.

What recourse do I have? Can they actually come back months later and tell me the time they approved was my fault? (They did not pay out any leftover time, they are claiming I was in the negative even though the software shows I wasn't.)

(They also failed to withhold state taxes despite me bringing it up several times. They only fixed it all at once when I left and mentioned I had spoken to the IRS. Their solution was a blank paystub and all state tax applicable wages listed there, and then they told me I would be penalized by the state for not paying state taxes on each paycheck. This is a very large company that should know better.)
