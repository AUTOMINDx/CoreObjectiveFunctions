When you finally find an amazing T but she's constantly away...
I think I'm a very picky person when it comes to finding a good therapist but I finally found one I love. I felt fairly safe with her starting session 1, which is huge for me

I wouldn't want to trade her for anyone else

But oh my goodness... it seems like she is at never-ending conferences. Every week I ask about scheduling and she's like "oh no next week I'm only here Monday because I have a conference" and then I think "okay well that's good, she's developing her skills" and then I shift my schedule around so I can see her Monday - but then the next week it'll be the same except this time maybe she's only there Friday

a very minor rant but I just wish it was easier to find amazing Ts
