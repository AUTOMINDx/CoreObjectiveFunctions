Meeting people outside of highschool
I graduated highschool (18M) and started a full time job, (11 hours a day 6 days a week) and with that schedule it takes most of time, after work i go to the gym then go home

I find myself in a loop and lacking meeting new people, also im not 21+ so i cant rly go to bars/clubs where ig most people are, i really just want freinds in my area or a girl to start talking to, any advice?
