Why were some earlier books given very long titles that almost became blurbs themselves? Or was the point that it was a blurb before blurbs officially existed on the dust jacket or back of a book?
For example:  The Female Shipwright, or, the Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Mary Lacy: Giving An Account Of Her leaving her Parents disguised as a Man; Serving Four Years At Sea, And Seven Years Apprenticeship in Portsmouth Dockyard, With The Means Which Led To A DISCOVERY OF HER SEX; When she obtained her Discharge, and was Allowed a PENSION by the Government.
