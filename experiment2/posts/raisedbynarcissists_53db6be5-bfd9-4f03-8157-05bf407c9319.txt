The Witch - A movie I don't see recommended nearly enough as an example of a toxic family and scapegoating in particular
I especially recommend it for anyone who grew up as a family scapegoat or in a very authoritarian religious family. I don't want to ruin the movie by explaining too much. I'll just say that if you like slow burn horror movies and period pieces you'll like it a lot.
