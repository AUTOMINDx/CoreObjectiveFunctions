Getting over being dumped by your date?
How long does it take everyone when the person theyâ€™re dating calls it off? And how do you help yourself move on? I (30/m) went on 3 dates with this woman over this month. Iâ€™d grown really fond of her but she called it off last Sunday. I was really sad about this, but I respected her decision. A week later, Iâ€™m still really sad and anxious. I canâ€™t help but think about her, hoping sheâ€™ll change her mind and gets in touch. Iâ€™m also beating myself up, wishing Iâ€™d done things differently on our dates.

Thereâ€™s a logical part of me thatâ€™s telling myself to pick myself up and move on. Thereâ€™s plenty of people out there, and that I shouldnâ€™t be so upset over 3 dates. Yet the emotional part of me is just stuck. Any advice?

*Update* Itâ€™s coming onto 2 weeks. And Iâ€™m feeling a lot better. Iâ€™m still a bit sad, and I still think about her a bit. But focusing on passions in life, and talking to both friends and new people has really helped. Thanks a lot for your advice and comforting words everyone ðŸ¤—
