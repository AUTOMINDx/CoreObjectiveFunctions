If you were claimed as a disabled dependent in 2020, did your March 2021 stimulus check arrive with your name or the tax filer's?

Hi folks.  I was claimed as a dependent in 2020 and was lied to about it.  Now I'm looking through information and realized I would have been eligible for a stimulus check equal to the person who claimed me ($1,400).

If you were an adult dependent claimed in 2020, your 2021 stimulus check would have been sent to the 2020 tax filer.  

My question is to whom were the dependents' stimulus checks addressed?  Was it a combined check in the filer's name?  Were there different checks addressed to each individual?  

If checks were issued in the dependent's name, that would mean the person who claimed me cashed "my" stimulus check from the IRS (or at minimum, simply kept it from me). This individual was reported to APS today (again) for financial abuse.  I'm curious if the stimulus check is another thing to add to the list.  I realize adult dependents are a fairly small "crew," so I'm *really* hoping someone can definitively answer my obscure question. 

I hope everyone is having a good evening.  Thanks in advance for info.  Wasn't sure who or where else to ask. â™¡
