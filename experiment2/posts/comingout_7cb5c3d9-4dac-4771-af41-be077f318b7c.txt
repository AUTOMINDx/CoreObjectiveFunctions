I'm coming out to my friend as a trans woman.
Hi all, here my small story.

Today I had a very bad day there was a lot of negative emotions, during all of this my friend texted me I said I would text later tonight.

I go home after work and got depressed, I texted my friend that my day is not good and he started joking trying to cheer me up, but I got mad at him and was rude.

He knew something was wrong and began to ask what happened, I told him everything and about the depression too, he asked what caused it and I told him about gender dysfunction that I feel.

He did not understand what it was about, but got on the Internet and read about it.

I confessed I felt like a trans woman, he took it as normal but now I feel really bad when I told him that, maybe I wasn't 100% ready for it but I think if he understands me I'll feel better but I'm also considering the situation our friendship could be damaged by this.
I'm so afraid of losing him because I don't communicate with a large circle of people. ðŸ˜£
