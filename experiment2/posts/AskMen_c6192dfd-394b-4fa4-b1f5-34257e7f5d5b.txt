Men who were in emotionally abusive relationships who had their trust broken, how have you been able to get over the damage your ex did, and move forward with someone new?
As title states, for those who have had their trust broken by previous partners/been in emotionally abusive relationships, did it ever hinder your next relationships? How did you finally get over what was done to you in the past, to be able to trust your next partner again? Especially when you’ve got someone good right in front of you but you’re too fearful to open up and be hurt again?
