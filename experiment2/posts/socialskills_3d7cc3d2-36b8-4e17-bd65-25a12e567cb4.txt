How to share my story without one-upping someone?
Since I catch lots of details, I sometimes have many stories that I think are interesting to me, but not necessarily for others during conversations. Consequently I always pick a story similar to what people are already talking about. 

For example a friend is talking about how her major has wine-tasting class, and others are like wow your major's so unique and I followed along. I wanted to talk about how my school offers wine-tasting classes as well and I took it too, but that would takeaway its uniqueness right? 

I can relate and say I have a similar story, but when should I tell my story, and how much should I say without one-upping them?
