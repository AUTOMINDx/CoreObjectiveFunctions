Confused
I am depressed but mostly confused by the fact that I feel as if I am successful and that I have built myself well overall character life skills I feel I did everything right and if I were to stop breathing at this very moment the world would simply blink once and move on. I was told that by being successful in career social settings life skills all of this working out at the gym that it would make people appreciate admire or love me. I have no idea what is wrong with me to be honest I feel I wanna say its depression but... It's more complicated than that... I feel like there is a great uncomprehensible darkness inside me that flows and the key word here is "infinitely" It defines my depression yes but also my joy my anger my success. An irrational infinite divinity that cannot be explained. I am not religious by any means but I feel as if it's beyond my control. So I am very confused as to why I am feeling this way, am I just crazy and this force doesn't exist? Or what is actually happening?
