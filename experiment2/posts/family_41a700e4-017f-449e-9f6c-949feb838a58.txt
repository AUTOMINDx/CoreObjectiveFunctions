how to stop a family fight?
Hi, this one is genuinely serious, my family and I fought 2 days ago, me and my mom maked up, but my big sister wont let it go, she is still talking about how i acted, is sarcastic to me and just talks behind my back and calls me bad words, its annoying me and triggering me so much, i just want a normal bond with my sister, honestly i dont know why i cant have that. She is literally rambling on about everything I did bad, and now she has no trust in me, shes calling me a liar every second when i do something good, she shouts at me and calls me names, she in other words is making this problem worse. Not only that i have nothing to do about it, she is my older sister so i cant physically argue without causing another problem, what do i do?
