Any PC laptops with spherical keys ?
Is there any such thing as a PC laptop with onboard spherical keys ? 
My fingers run amok on the flat keys.  
Not finding any reference for what im looking for except on a separate keyboard.  
Spherical keys= old style with 4 raised corners and a concave surface.
