Asked to do move forward in the recruitment process for a job that rejected me two weeks ago. Why could this be the case?
Two weeks ago, I applied for a position with a new company. After submitting the application, I was told that if I was a potential fit I would be contacted with a request to complete a Hirevue assessment and then move onto interviews if I scored a good result.

A couple days later, I got the standard automated "Dear Candidate, we regret to inform you that you will not be moving forward in the hiring process yada yada yada". A little disappointing but no big deal - I accepted it and moved on.

However, 2 days ago, I get an email from HR congratulating me and saying I've been selected to move to the next phase of the recruitment process, and I was asked to do the Hirevue assessment. I went ahead and did it anyways since it was only about 45 minutes of my time and the absolute worst case scenario is I have some free practice and experience in the software in case I have to use it again later, but I'm still a little confused.

Was I accidentally sent the assessment after I had been rejected from the job, or was I not supposed to receive a rejection email in the first place? I sent an email to the HR/recruiting person that emailed me confirming that I received and completed the assessment per their instructions, but I never heard back.

Just wanted to see if anyone had any insight on if this is a relatively common thing to occur and what the reasoning behind it may be, or if it's just a glitch in their automated systems. Thanks!
