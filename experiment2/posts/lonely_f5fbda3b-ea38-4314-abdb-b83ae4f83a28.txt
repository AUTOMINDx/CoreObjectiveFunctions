So I’m a 21 F college student. After being cheated on by my long term boyfriend, I went through a hoe phase for a few months. I talked to/slept with a few guys. I quickly got tired of it, and now I’m at the point where I want to feel lovable. Being desirable is nice, but knowing that someone is capable of loving me is different. 

Some background on my previous serious relationship: he and I dated for two years. We started dating before he went to join the marines. He had poor communication skills and would be highly affectionate whenever we did talk. This made me think he was crazy about me and that he was just busy. No, the entire time he was stringing me and a few other girls along with him. 

After figuring out his lies, my brain started asking questions. Did he mean what he said to me? Did he even like me? Was he just using me? Was I actually deserving of his “love” or was I there for satisfaction?

It’s been almost 2 years since that relationship and I still have the issue of whether or not I am deserving of love. One of the few people I was able to be in a “relationship” with was entirely fake. So it’s made me wonder if I really deserve love or not. 

Within those two years, it’s not that I haven’t tired talking to other guys, but I get rejected. It’s not that I expect that any guy I talk to drop everything for me, but at least seem interested. I keep getting the same “I love your personality, but I don’t see this going anywhere” or “I like what we have, but we need to stop”. It’s gotten to the point where I’m starting to think that my only worth is sexual. Like I’m cute enough to sleep with, but not cute enough to date. 

Sex is nice and all, but I’m craving to be with someone. I want to know that I’m capable of being loved. I want to be someone’s someone. 

I know this post maybe nothing but rambles, but I just need to vent. Any self esteem growing advice would be much appreciated.

***Clarifications: there’s a lot more than just the one relationship and failed attempts. I made this post at 5am and wanted to keep it a post rather than a book. 

- was 16 dating a 19 year old that ended up mentally, sexually, and emotionally abusing me. (6 months and a lot to go into)
- literally being told that I was pretty enough to f**k but not date.
- “sometimes the pretty girls don’t have good p***y and that’s why you make me c*m so fast” what a guy had said to me after hooking up thinking he complimented me.
- a guy that perused me, we started seeing each other more often, suddenly started he ghost me, then he messages me maybe 9 months later saying he wants to be what we were but better, and then his actual text ending things with me “Okay well, I like hanging out with you but I don’t want to waste your time or anything, and yeah i don’t wanna ghost you or anything but i do believe that we should stop everything we’re doing.”
