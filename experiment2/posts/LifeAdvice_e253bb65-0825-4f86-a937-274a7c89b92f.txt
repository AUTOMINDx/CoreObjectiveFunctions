Why am I dreaming of my ex every night?
I’ve been knowing my ex going on 9 years. We had been on &amp; off literally since I was 14 years old I’m 23. 

From 20-23 we officially dated. On &amp; off. Long distant even lived together at some point. 

We called it quits this year around august &amp; I haven’t seen him since. We talked once I think in September but briefly. 

We’re not together because we was both young &amp; immature &amp; needed a lot of healing. We both came from a broken past. I was willing to fix mines but he was not. He also showed some narcissistic behaviors. However we lived two different lifestyles. I more ambitious &amp; entrepreneurial &amp; he was more of an artist &amp; started doing illegal things. 

Recently I discovered that he is in a knew relationship. &amp; which I’m not upset at. That’s lady can have him. I just want him to stop appearing in my dreams every night 

Can someone tell me how I can stop this or why this is happening?
