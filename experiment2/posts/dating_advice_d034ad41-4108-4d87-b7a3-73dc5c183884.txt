I like this girl… but she’s really dry.
So theres this girl I like. To preface, she actually likes me too, in fact, we both like each other and have had a first date that went AMAZINGLY well. Like, almost too well. Prior to the date, I’ve known her for months but just recently we became closer. We talked about what we wanted to do in terms of putting a label, but we’re not sure. But she’s really dry in person, and I’ve no idea what to talk about with her sometime

EDIT: LMAO OMG WAIT THIS ACTUALLY BLEW UP. i was high asf when I wrote this. Anyways, to add more detail, the date went super duper well, and she’s a cool person. We’ve known each other for months but just started like actually talking. We talked A LOT during the date, but in general, sometimes I find it hard for her to carry the conversation when we talk (I’m excluding the date). And I don’t know if it’s me who’s the dry one and can’t think of anything to say, or if she’s just not really a talker. But when we text, it’s a lot better.
