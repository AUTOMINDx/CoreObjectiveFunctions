Any tips to fall asleep with 29 cm (~11.4 inches) incline?
Hello, how do you manage to sleep with incline? Recently I got an anti-reflux pillow but I am struggling to sleep on it. I usually sleep on my chest or right/left side but the pillow is pretty hard and also because of the incline it is very uncomfortable. I tried to put another thin and soft pillow over the anti-reflux pillow but still, because of the incline I spend almost the whole night trying to fall asleep, and as result very tired which only makes me feel worse.
