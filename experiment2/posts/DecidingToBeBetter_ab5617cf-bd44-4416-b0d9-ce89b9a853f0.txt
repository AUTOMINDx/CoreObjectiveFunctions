Shifting energy; worries to work.
I've had a lazy attitude towards school and work lastly and I've spent lots of my energy worrying too much about stuff I can't change right now.

This week I will shift my energy; from my worries to my work.

I will be more positive and flow with a hard-working attitude, and even if I don't feel it I will fake it cuz this ain't takin me anywhere.

Imma post an update day by day.
