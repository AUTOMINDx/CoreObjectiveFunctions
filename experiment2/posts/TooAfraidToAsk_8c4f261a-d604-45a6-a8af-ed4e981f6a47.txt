Why is it, despite having an absurd amount of infections, and having a good population of people vaccine hesitant, why is the US so lenient with masks and covid restrictions?
as someone living outside of the States and in a country that has strict implementations of everything, this confuses me. I just recently looked at the NY times and their covid tracker and it said that the States was one of the highest risks (I’m open for someone to tell me that the NY isn’t reliable if it isn’t.) I’ve been also reading around here on reddit and other sources that cases are going higher again in the States but everyone there seems to act normal lol.
