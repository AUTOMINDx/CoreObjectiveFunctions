Does consistently putting effort to getting better lead to a better life?
Early on in my life,  I felt that in order to live in the best way possible I need to continuously work on my self . So , I started working on improving my self and over the years I did get some results but I have also seen so many people achieving their goals by getting lucky or by contact's or by privilege( born with loads of money or powerful relatives). I have seen this happen so many times that I feel does it matter how much sweat ,blood and tears we put into improving ower self or should we leave it to the universe to do our bidding.

I know that comparing is not good and each of our lives are unique but it really hurts when you put all your strength and brains into achive your goals but some people just get it with out the work and decipline  .
