I got better. You can too
I was struggling with suicidal thoughts, sadness, being tired all the time, anorexia, and a nicotine addiction as the cherry on top. I didn't like that and decided to change. I realized that  the best thing in the whole world could happen to me, and I'd still feel terrible. It was up to me to change the way I felt. 
I did and it worked. I deleted all social media (except this, I occasionally scroll through r/books)
I have never felt happier and healthier and cleaner. I am so blessed.
