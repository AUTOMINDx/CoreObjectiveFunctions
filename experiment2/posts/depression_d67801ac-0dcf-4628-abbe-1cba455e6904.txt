Man im tired
Im tired of being told "man up" and stuff like that. Like bro i got feelings too. And when i get home i do all the cooking and that stuff that the parents usaly do. My mom keep on saying she had a long day.
I have long days too.

Im just tired of being myself. I cant express my feelings without being made fun of.

Cause bro like. I feel like i have a bad habit. Treating people better than they treat me. Shits tough
