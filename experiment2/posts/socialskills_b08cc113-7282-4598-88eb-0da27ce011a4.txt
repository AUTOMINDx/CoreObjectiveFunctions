How do you socialise if you have face blindness?
How do you socialise if you can’t recognise people?  I think my kids are missing out on get togethers with friends because I haven’t made many connections due to not being able to recognise their friends parents after only meeting them once or twice.

I need to meet people many, many times before I can put a name with the face, and if the face changes in any way (sunglasses, hat, facial hair etc) it takes a while to work out who they are again.  Also, context makes a big part of it - if I see a workmate at something related to my kids, I’ll have no idea who they are or where I know them from. 

It’s not just a lack of effort - one example was first time I saw my sister in uniform after she joined up, I didn’t recognise her.  Another  example  is my partner of 10 years decided to grow a beard and I completely walked past him outside the shopping centre because he was wearing glasses and a hat.

I’m quite good at chatting with people without using names, but I think it’s really limiting when it comes to actually socialising.
