The males in my family always presume they are right. It's making me not want a relationship with them?
I'm a person who likes to hear different perspectives. I think there is a logical answer to certain things, but not everyone thinks logically. It does not mean their approach is wrong. However, the men in my family are insistent that things should go one way and one way only. And it's always their way. It's real annoying. I've gotten into arguments with real stubborn people in my family. Because I found it hard to believe people could be stuck in such a narrow way of thinking. Lack of empathy is such a huge thing in my family. It's a sign of intelligence to many. I don't think I should further engage in this dominated cultural thinking that my family seem to love to engage in. I can feel my blood pressure rising every time. However, no one ever takes me seriously and the frustrating part is I try real hard to create a great environment that just gets plagued with hostility and one way thinking. TLDR; I can't be around my family's way of thinking without feeling physiological effects. Should I just cut them off?
