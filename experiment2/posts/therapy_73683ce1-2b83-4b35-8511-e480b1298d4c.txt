Why does having a dirty house stress me out so much?
I live with my partner and his brother. They both were kind of babied by mom, she did EVERYTHING for them. They aren't the worst, for the most part though they cannot keep things organized or deep clean.

It gives me major anxiety when his brother cooks and leaves the kitchen a mess. Doesn't wipe down counters, the stove or wash his dishes. His dishes, pots will stay there while he plays video games and he fills the drying rack when he does do the dishes, doesn't bother to put them away when they are dry so we can have space. I've addressed these things before, he only does it when he feels like it I suppose. 

It also drives me nuts how his dog eats, leaves the floor filled with his kibble and he doesn't clean it up until someone says something. He will also leave wrappers on the floor instead of throwing it in the trash can.

I see these things and I lose my mind. My anxiety goes up the roof, can't sleep well, my mind keeps running in circles on how I need to address him AGAIN about these issues. Yes we all pay rent but that doesn't excuse someone from cleaning up after themselves. 

How can I deal with this stress? Having a dirty house triggers me really bad.
