Is Locke really an empiricist and does he contradict himself?
I'm studying Locke's writings, specifically *Human Understanding* and seem to have found a contradiction in Locke's argument for the existence of God (Chapter X). Locke is obviously an empiricist and believes that there are no innate ideas that humans are naturally born with. He also states that humans have been granted innate faculties that enable us to perceive sensory stimuli, further strengthening his empiricist views.

However, in Locke's proof of the existence of God, he frequently appeals to our reason or common sense to explain the necessity of God. He continously argues that we/matter/intelligence must have been causally created by something, which eventually leads him to argue for the existence of a cognitive, all-powerful and eternal God. 

This method seems like a contradiction to me. Why is rational thinking and "common" sense a legitimate tool to use for an empirical argument? Isn't rational thinking an innate idea? Alternatively, does Locke see reason as merely a technical faculty? In general, I'm really interested in hearing different opinions regarding if Locke's theological proof in Chapter X aligns with his empirical theory.
