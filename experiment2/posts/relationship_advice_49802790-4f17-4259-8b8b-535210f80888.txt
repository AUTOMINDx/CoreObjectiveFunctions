8 Years Gone
My Bf of 8 years has just broke up with me to better his mental health, I have done nothing to him, he stated that I have been perfect and he is the problem. He says he still loves me and wants me to wait until he is better, but he isn’t promising this. I just don’t understand how everything was perfect and it still fell flat in my face. I’m broken, destroyed he infact stated to me the day previous we could book hotels for holidays etc and not even 24hrs later tells me he doesn’t want to be with me anymore and the holidays etc are off. No arguments no problems in fact it was pure happiness when we were with each other which he agrees. I’m so lost and confused I have little friends and am incredibly destroyed now. Any advice on how to make this easier is appreciated
