Why was French leadership so hampered in 1940?
I feel like this is something I've heard of forever as a given truth - French political and military leadership collectively just was not in a place where it was able to handle active war with Germany in 1940.

But what exactly made it this way? Was it deep, long term institutional issues? Or was it specifically related to, say, the 1934 political crisis and French politics of the 1930s that prevented the country from pulling together like it did in 1914-1918? Were there different issues among the senior military leadership? Were those directly the results of the First World War? 

Basically - what happened? Clearly there *were* leaders (like de Gaulle, I would assume) in both the military and political spheres, but were there just too few such figures, or was something institutional or because of concurrent events preventing that talent from coming through?
