[DC] Do the Monitor Brothers have "true forms" in the 6th Dimension?
So we know that Darkseid has a true form in a higher dimension, right? But what about the Monitors? I mean, they are 6th dimensional beings afterall...

Also, what about the "baby" Monitors from Infinite Crisis and Final Crisis who are said the aspects of Mar Novu? Do you think they're all just extensions of Mar Novu's true form or are they actually the splinted remains of Mar Novu's true form?(Basically, what I'm asking is did Mar Novu's true form get splintered as well when the baby Monitors were created?)
