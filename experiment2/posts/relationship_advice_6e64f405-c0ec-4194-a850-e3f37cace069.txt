My friend [32/F] came to America from Scotland to visit her boyfriend [28/M] only for him to call off marriage.
My friend (32F) and her boyfriend (28M) have been in a relationship for 7 years. They met online through an online game and their relationship has been long distance. My friend lives in Scotland and her boyfriend lives in the USA.

They have met in real life before but have not in 2 years due to the pandemic. Recently, they have been discussing marriage options but the boyfriend always seemed doubtful and hesitant. Now, my friend has gone to America and only a few days into her arrival, the boyfriend called off the wedding.

I’m posting here because I’ve never gotten far in relationships and this is a far bigger issue than I have ever managed. But what should my friend do in this situation? She is staying in America with him until March but I’m worried about her. 

tl;dr: My friend [32/F] has been in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend [28/M] and she came to America from Scotland only for him to call off marriage plans. 

Update: I forgot to mention that this is my first time posting on this reddit so I apologize for any mistakes made!
Also another important note to mention is that the boyfriend was the one the initially proposed, not my friend. 

Thank you!
