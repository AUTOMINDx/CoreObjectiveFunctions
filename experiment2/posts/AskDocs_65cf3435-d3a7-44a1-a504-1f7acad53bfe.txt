8 year old child reaction to the Flu/COVID vaccine
Our 8 year old daughter received the combo of the Covid and flu vaccine on the same day last Saturday. 

Sunday she woke up vomiting continuously throughout the day with an often on low fever including a headache.  

Monday she woke up with an uncontrollable nose bleed and could not move her head, with an often on low fever, she only vomited once on Monday.

Tuesday she vomited again and could still not move her neck and had a low-grade fever.  We brought her in to urgent care they sent us to the ER and gave her an IV and some nausea medicine. They were suspecting it was meningitis but decided not to give the spinal tap test.  

Wednesday she felt better and continued to be somewhat normal until this morning (Sunday) she woke up vomiting and complaining of a severe headache and couldn’t move her head again. 

Right now they are running a CT scan and doing the spinal tap to rule out meningitis and leukemia.  

I can’t find much on the Internet when it comes to reactions to the Covid vaccine, but the first ER doctor said that the combination of having both the Covid and flu vaccine as well as previously having Covid may have led to her current condition. 

Any insight or idea of this happening elsewhere since this is so new would be much appreciated.
