Do you ever envy Bruce Wayne/Batman for his parents dying at the ‘failure to thrive’ age range?
I have decided to go no contact with my N-father as of yesterday, and there is already a feeling of self-respect and freedom that was only there when he was just a peripheral part of my life. 

Too many deep gut feelings. 

One of them I brought to light today: I always envied Bruce Wayne. Some times more than others. 

This morning I was chewing on that thought for what has to be the millionth time in my life. And I thought to myself - 

“Yeah, Joe Chill could have shot my father dead and I would have been like ‘yyyEEAaaaaAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!’ With a narcissistic father dead, no wonder Bruce was able to finally take that anger and rage and go become something that his N-father would never ever be able to …”

Yeah. I feel free.
