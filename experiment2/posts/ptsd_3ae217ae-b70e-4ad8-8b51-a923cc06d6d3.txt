Are your nightmares abstract?
TW: sexual abuse

So my trauma has to do with a childhood sexual assault at a family lake house. That’s about as specific as I’ll be. 

However, my “nightmares” are really…abstract? Instead of dreaming of the actual trauma, I’ll dream about children (most often my little sister who would’ve been about my age) drowning, witness/partake in incest, or being sexually assaulted (but not by abuser). The one that bothers me the most though is the dreams I have about my sister drowning. 

I just started taking prazosin so I’m hoping that kicks in soon because its really unpleasant lol. But I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar? Are your dreams sort of abstract with bits and pieces of the trauma scattered about instead of exact replicas of it? I wonder if the fact that I don’t really remember the event has anything to do with it, too.
