I feel like I am the ugliest person in the world.
I’m 15 I’ve been trying to get a girlfriend for a while and haven’t had any luck. I am 5”9 and weigh 156lbs, whenever I see myself in a picture I can’t help but wonder if my looks are what keeps me from getting a girlfriend. These thoughts haunt me everyday. Any advice?
