Struggle to find online article
Hello !

Currently this is the last year of my bachelor in philosophy and I need to write a philosophy paper as a final notation.

The choice of the thema is totally free and I think I will write about the relationship between religion and space exploration. There are a lot of interesting question to developp  and I still need time to know witch one to take. But I admit, I struggle to find a lot of article about this large subject. I already find some article about it with some website (like [philpapers.org](https://philpapers.org), google scholar...) and also by the reading of some Philosophic paper in my universtiy, but that's not enough.

Did somebody now if there are interesting article about this subject, or if there are better website to find philosophy paper ?

I thank you in advance !

This is the first time I post a message on a Reddit and english is not my native language so that's why there are some spelling mistake (I'm from Swizerland btw)\^\^'

(Ps: If I'm in the wrong place to ask this kind of question, please give me the right subreddit \^\^ Thank you !)
