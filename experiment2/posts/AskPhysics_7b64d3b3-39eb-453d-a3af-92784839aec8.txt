A Hypothetical Centrifuge
Consider a centrifuge that rotates at a constant angular velocity. Imagine that, while obeying the laws of special relativity, it is possible to get a tangential speeds close to the speed of light.
Attached to the center is an omnidirectional point source of light. 
Are there any properties of the light that would change when viewed from a perfectly inertial reference frame outside of the system?
