How does one meet new people.
I grew up as a military brat which means I moved a lot. Though I always had that small group of friends throughout school. I'm in the military now and get along with my platoon but not enough to make friends. All of my hobbies are really alone kinda things such as guitar, wood working, and videogames. How do I meet people outside of my platoon? I thought about volunteering again but the places are closed on the weekends and when I get off work.
