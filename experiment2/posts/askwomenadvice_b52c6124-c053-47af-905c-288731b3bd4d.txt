How should I politely decline nudes being sent to me without my liking?
How should we politely decline receiving a nude?

Context is I'm super sweet in messages (R4R subreddit) but they suddenly send an unexpected nude sometimes. I'm not always in the mood so I guess it makes me uncomfortable.

I would appreciate a selfie more (No photo is better than a sudden nude for me at least). I'm a man and I guess they expect me to already like nudes any time of the day? I'd prefer to see their eyes and personality:(

Thank you in advance ðŸ˜Š
