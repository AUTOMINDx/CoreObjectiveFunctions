Do we know how the believes and myth of groups who almost disappeared due to a major disaster (when more than 90% of the initial population died) changed? How did the survivors incorporated this shock in the already-existing system of believes?
Asking this question with the Amazon tribes in mind, but I would be interested in answers about other populations too :)
