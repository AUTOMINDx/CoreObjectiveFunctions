Anniversary Effect
December 2020 - March 2021 were by far the WORST months of my life. I had a huge breakdown just before xmas and it left me with agoraphobia and needing anxiety meds (which I’ve been on since January).
Nearly a year later and I thought I was well on the road to recovery - I’ve been having no trouble with leaving the house and my anxiety bothers me less.
However, my family and I put our xmas decorations up on Sunday and I immediately broke down crying. Since then I’ve been feeling so so incredibly anxious and it’s like all my work to get better has been erased. I’m usually a huge lover of xmas, but I couldn’t feel any less festive than I do now.
I’ve done a little research and I think I’m suffering from the anniversary effect :( My problem with this is that I’m worried as to how long I’ll be feeling like this.
