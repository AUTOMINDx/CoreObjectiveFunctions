Need u r opinion.?
Hi everyone i hope everyone is doing. So their is this one girl who i love (crush) for the past 2 year. We saw each other like 2 years ago and i also know that she loves me back ( through a good friend of mine) . We both have been talking to each other for the last 3 months  but right now she is giving me mixed signals i dont know if i should shoot my shot i mean she flirts with me with me one day  and the next day is totally the opposite. Im literally confused right now
