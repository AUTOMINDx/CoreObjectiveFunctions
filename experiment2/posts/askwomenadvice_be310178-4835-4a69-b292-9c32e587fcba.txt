How can I help myself from being too analytical and not let overthinking take over?
So, as the title states, I (35F) was told today that I'm an analytical person, which I'm ok with, BUT I now work in a somewhat fast paced environment where being too analytical can be a hindrance to performance.

I have figured out that it stems from my ADHD, and also from not wanting to let anyone down or failing at something.

Does anyone have any thoughts/ideas on how I can manage how I am, so that I can perform without overthinking job duties in order to 'keep up' and not hold anyone back for any reason. 

Some more context: I am a former correctional officer from a male only facility who recently began work at county jail, so while the majority is the same, some aspects are different (working with female inmates). Thanks.

TL;DR Analytical female that has ADHD with a fear of letting people down and failing at things needing thoughts/ideas on how to manage/avoid overthinking and be great as a new detention officer at a county jail. Thanks.
