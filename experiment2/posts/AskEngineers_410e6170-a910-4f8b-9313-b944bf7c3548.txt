Coating material for metal ends that come in contact with skin
I have found tools like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Massager-Body-Back-Company-Stress/dp/B001IHXFQK) that are made of metal and have some kind of coating at the end that allows skin contact to feel good. Is there a way to reproduce this at home? Are there alternatives that can be considered to cover a metal tip to make it feel better on the skin? I have been thinking about using some kind of liquid that dries out, but e.g. regular paint causes the friction to be too high. The ends of this headscratcher I liked are very smooth and glide on the skin. Is this some kind of special material?
