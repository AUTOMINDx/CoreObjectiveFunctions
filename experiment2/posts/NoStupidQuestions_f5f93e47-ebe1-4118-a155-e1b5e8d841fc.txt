Why are so few homeless men bald?
I've noticed it and there's a lot of discussion about it on the internet. You will almost never see a bald homeless man.

There are lots of theories. One theory says that the average person over-shampoos their hair, accelerating their genetic baldness - but homeless people rarely have access to a shower and thus cannot damage their hair by over-cleaning. Another theory says that many chronically homeless people are using drugs (mostly alcohol) that suppress testosterone, which is a known factor in balding. A third theory says that homeless men appear older than they are because of their tough circumstances, which can cause a 30 year old homeless man to appear 50, giving him the appearance of much better hair than his age would permit.

Do any of these theories have truth to them? Has anyone else noticed that homeless men seem to always have a super thick beautiful head of hair?
