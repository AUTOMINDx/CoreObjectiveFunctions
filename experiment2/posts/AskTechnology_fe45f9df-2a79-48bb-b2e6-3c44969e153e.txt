What Operating System should I use?
I use *want to use* my computer for:

* Gaming
* Coding
* Web Browsing and other basic tasks

I am currently using Arch Linux but GNU/Linux is not the best OS for Gaming and Entertainment.

I was thinking of switching to Windows but I don't like having Microsoft track me with telemetry background tasks.

I am not sure what OS I should switch to.
