Applying for jobs with a masters but not a bachelors degree
I have a bit of a unique situation where I have two masters (an MA and an MPA both from world leading institutions) but no bachelors degree. 

My first degree came from a program where you'd study at the undergraduate level for two years and then at the graduate level for two years (it wasn't a US school). If you made it through all four years, you got your MA. Only those who left after the third year would get a bachelors. The school didn't bother to award a bachelors to those who made it through the entire four year program. 

I keep running into a problem where my resume is getting rejected by computers because, I suspect, my lack of a bachelors. What should I do to get around this? I'd rather not have to lie on my resume or make it seem less impressive than it was.
