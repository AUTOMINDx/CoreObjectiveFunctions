Any career alternatives for a Fashion Buyer?
Today my wife hands in her resignation letter - after 8 years as a Fashion Buyer.  
She's very talented at what she does - and is incredibly hard working - but the elements of merchandising that fall outside of her control - and constant stresses, endless working hours - and poor management finally led her to put her own health first. 

We'll be able to get by for around 5 months whilst she looks for another job - but wanted to find out if anyone has any ideas of alternative career choices for someone who was in fashion / merchandising - that are still creatively stimulating?

Thank you!
