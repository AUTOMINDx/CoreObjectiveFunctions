How do you manage to be assertive about what you want and don’t want in bed?
I’m (22F) in a new relationship and I am not sure i can trust myself to actually voice what i want and don’t want when it comes to being intimate. I have been through SA before and i guess part of me just learned that my voice doesn’t really matter or that what he wants is more important than what i want. In my last relationship I’d find myself agreeing, lying or just keeping quiet and going along with situations I wasn’t comfortable doing for him, putting pressure on myself to do stuff I didn’t want to do, convincing myself that it was fine and it was okay with being selfless when in reality i was just hurting myself..
