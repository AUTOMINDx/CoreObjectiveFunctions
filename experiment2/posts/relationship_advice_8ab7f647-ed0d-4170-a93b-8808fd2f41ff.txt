Should I tell my crush that I love him even if my friends are mocking him?
I (f16) love one of my classmates (m16). We've known each other for 4 months and I've realised that I have feelings for him.

He is not physically attractive and I am well aware of that. I didn't think it was a big deal, until my friends started joking about how ugly he is. They know that I like him, but they're just being very disrespectful.
I'm not mad at them. It just makes me sad and I'm hesitating if this is a good idea to tell him my feelings.

The problem is, I am not close with my crush. We're friendly and greet each other, sometimes have small talks, but that's it.
He knows that someone is interested in him because one of my friend told him without mentioning that it is me. I don't really know if suspects me to be honest. But one thing I am sure is that he isn't in a relationship.

That doesn't stop me from feeling attracted to him and I don't know what to do. My friends are not very supportive and I'm very scared of their jugement.

Should I tell him?

Edit: Thank you for all your wise responses and advices. It seems to have a problem with my phrasing: I only have a crush on him. I am not fluent in english so I didn't know there was a difference between loving and having a crush on someone. I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding.
A lot of you said that I should spend time with him first. It's very hard for me because I'm extremely shy. I still do my best
I'm very grateful, thank you again.
