Which decoupling cap placement is most optimal?
In this made up example which would be considered closer to ideal decoupling cap placement?

The 1st scheme would have lower common impedance but higher impedance to their respective load.

2nd seems more logical but wouldn't an ideal ground have zero impedance between all points, which 1st seems closer to.
