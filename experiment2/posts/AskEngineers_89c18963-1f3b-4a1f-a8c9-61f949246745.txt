Do these bonuses justify staying at my current job or should I be job hunting?
Electrical engineer graduated May 2019. Working reliability engineering for defense contractor. Really really really enjoy the company I work for. Great people, good benefits, and been working from home pretty much my entire career. Been with same company almost 3 years but structure of company only allows pay raises with more job duties and my particular job is one that really doesn’t have that ability. Tried mentioning to supervisor how I’d like to change jobs within company and do some more technical work and possible raise but he insists that sky is the limit where I’m at. My question is based on the info I’m about to provide below, should I stay or be job hunting?

Year 1 - 3% cost of living adjustment and $500 performance bonus

Year 2- 1.5% COLA and $3500 performance bonus

Year 3- not sure of COLA until new year and $4500 performance bonus and will gain an extra week of PTO

Do these bonuses cancel out the need for a raise or do I wait until the full 3 year mark to see if I get a raise or should I be casually shopping around now?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!
