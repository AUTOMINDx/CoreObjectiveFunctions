Hireright progress question
I submitted a form for a background check to HireRight on Nov. 18. I am supposed to start my new job on Dec. 13. When I login to my candidate portal, there are just 3 circles - Forms (which has a check mark in it), a background verification circle (green but not check), and report and review (also no check).

I see a lot of people saying they're getting percentages for progress, but I still have nothing. Anyone have any insight into what the hold up could be? It originally said 1-5 business days. I'm just getting kind of nervous because I already turned in my 2 weeks. 

Also, any insight into what they're even searching for in my background check would be great too. There shouldn't be any glaring discrepancies or anything like that so I don't know...
