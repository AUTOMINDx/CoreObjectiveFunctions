Christmas Conflict?
My husband and I are pretty burnt out at the moment - we both work 50+ hours each week and I have a massive commute each day to work. We also haven't managed much time off together in the past few years and we were really looking forward to four days break together at Christmas. 

Due to a split in my family, my brothers won't be in the same room as each other and as usual, my parents wants to throw two different family Christmases on two different days. My brothers have chosen days they want to visit and there is an expectation that we will attend both events - I have literally be instructed to be there by a family member! To make matters worse, my parents live in a different city to us, so the commute is a few hours round trip. 

To further complicate matters, one bother has young kids who I am very close to, so I am leaning towards one event and am probably going to hurt the other party if I pick one.

Do I throw aside my very limited time with my husband to attend both events with the family? Or do we stop fostering their disunity, and be selfish with my time? 

I've always been the peace maker in my family, but am beginning to resent this time of year after accommodating everyone for a decade.
