Sometimes I feel like an outsider in my own society
Sometimes I feel like an outsider in my own society. I was raised with honor, values, morals, obligations and responsibilities. Even though therapy has deconstructed part of this so that I can be someone original and not just a product of what society expects of me.

I still feel abandoned by what I should call brothers and sisters and part of me is starting to feel angry about it. It's like every time I need to talk to someone I'm myself, but... at the same time I need to hide or omit a part of me. All this in the name of security. It's horrible to build relationships knowing you'll never trust someone as much as you wanted.

I take care of my younger brother, help my parents pay their household bills, am a pride to many of my relatives, and have always been considered a symbol of wisdom just for having spent most of my life immersed in studies.

Now I have a good job, I'm saving money to buy my house and I'm building my life. But still... I can't forget. I'm starting to think that even living in society, even contributing, even helping the less fortunate, even being the best person I was taught to be. I will never be a part of you.

And to think that being born with an attraction to children could cause all of that. It doesn't matter if I'm against child abuse and exploitation. My existence is enough for some people to want to kill me. And I no longer hate myself to the point of saying I would let them do it without consequences.  


Will I ever be able to feel it was worth it? There are so many things I wanted to talk about but I can't.
