Is a design engineering degree less valued than a mechanical or aeronautical engineering degree?
I'm currently in my final year of sixth form (uk) and am about to apply to unis but I can't decide which degree to take. 

Aeronautical, mechanical and design are the ones I'm currently deciding between. I've looked at the modules for each of the unis that I would apply to for the given degree and I'd be happy doingn any of the three because they all interest me. My worry is that one degree might be less valued than others eg ik this isn't physics but my friend is doing a theoretical physics degree rather than astronomy because even though that's what he wants to do he's been told employers prefer a theoretical physics degree.

I know that mechanical and aeronautical are both valued and I know that design is too but just not if it is equally respected by employers.

There aren't any engineers in my family or family friends I can talk to about this which is why I'm posting and all the internet research I've done just tells me about the job prospects which doesn't really answer my question. 

Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated
