By pressure I lied to my parents and ruined my life
I don't know what to do, I lied to my parents about the classes I have  passed in the university and now I have an opportunity to save  everything but it is very difficult (near to impossible) because there  are too many things to do. **I don't like to lie**,  I did it under pressure because I didn't dare to tell them that I fail  in some classes (They asked about college in a casual convo and I had to  answer fast and under pressure. They want me to finish college soon)  and now it has become a giant snowball that I don't know how to fix. I  never wanted to lie and now this happens D':
