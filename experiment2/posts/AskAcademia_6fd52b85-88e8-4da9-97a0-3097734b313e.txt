What should I expect from my advisor? It seems like she doesn't have any interest in my work
Hi,

I'm in the process of writing my thesis. My advisor is good at her work and I think she is a good person as well. But for the last couple of weeks it seems like she has zero interest in my work. She hasn't returned to my email from I think two weeks ago (not the first time) and I feel like when I try to communicate, I'm forcing her to do something she doesn't want. Obviously she might have personal issues and she is a very busy person but I feel like I'm not doing enough if I let things go like this. So I'm still trying to set meetings on the days we agreed on meeting at the beginning of the term. 

I think if I'm incompetent and she doesn't want to be my advisor she should just tell me. Or if she's having personal issues, shouldn't she notify me and we could have longer breaks between our meetings?

Thanks to the pandemic I only have contact with two other students but I don't feel comfortable asking them so I'm asking here.

I'm really sad and I don't know what to do. I honestly think she just gave up and I should look for a new advisor. But this will cost me time and there isn't anyone who's working on a similar subject in my department and I'm not even sure how to do that.

Any advice is much appreciated.
