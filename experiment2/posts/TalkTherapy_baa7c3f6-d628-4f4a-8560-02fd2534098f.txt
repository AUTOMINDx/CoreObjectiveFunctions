Too affectionate towards T - cant open up
I've always had a relationship with the people closer to me in which I cant really talk about my feelings - having someone who actually cares about me knowing what I go through is a lot. 

 I've been with my T for almost 6 years now. I sort of see him as a father figure, and now got to the point where I cant really open up. I know he cares a lot about me and we have a lot of affection towards each other. 

Today, I told him about this feelings and mentioned stopping therapy, feeling like we are stuck and I'm super hesitant to talk about how bad things are and some recent involvement with drugs. I do not want him to worry about me. 
He said we can use this state of our relationship to actually work through this with him as well as people closer to me. 

IDK if I should give this another shot or move on and look for someone new. What to do?
