Have the last ~100 years of findings in physics and neuroscience spawned some notable philosophical ideas?
Given the new facts brought to us by physics and neuroscience over the last century, have philosophers' notions of reality been affected? Have there been notable, new ideas in epistemology, metaphysics, or philosophy of mind.

Thanks :)
