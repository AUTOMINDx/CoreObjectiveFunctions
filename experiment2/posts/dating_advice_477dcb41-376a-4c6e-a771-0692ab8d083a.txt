how long do you wait before opening up to someone new about personal issues/baggage?
after doing some self reflection, i (21f) feel my last few dates may not have gone too well because i opened up too quickly. like on the first date too quickly. i didn’t really mean to, and i am desensitized enough to my own crazy life that i forget other people do in fact, find it crazy and maybe somewhat scary. i’m bad at keeping secrets and i’ve always just felt in order for me to really be my true self, people just gotta know what’s going on in my life so that everything i talk about makes sense. i wasn’t really looking for a therapist or to vent, i have that, but i still had the urge to get it out there quickly. i find it exhausting to have to tiptoe around all the deep stuff (family traumas, mental health, court cases, friend drama, etc) and pretend i am this perfect person with nothing going on behind the scenes. i also get scared that once they find out, they will run for the hills. i have always been one to share my life story with strangers just cuz. 

however with all that said, i realize that approach hasn’t really worked for me, as i am still depressingly single. so going to try out this new method even tho i am slightly scared they will run once they get to know all my baggage. 

tl;dr how long do you wait before getting into deep stuff with new people you are dating? i  have mental health issues (bipolar, so it’s not a “fix myself and come back when i’m better” situation) that would most definitely need to be discussed before entering a relationship with someone. 

thanks y’all!
