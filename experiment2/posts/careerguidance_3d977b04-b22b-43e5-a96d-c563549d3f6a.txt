I'm torn between Graphic design and Front end dev, should I do both ?
Hello!

After a few months of thinking about it and trying all sorts of things, I learned alot about myself and I know that I'm interested in graphic design and programming, and I honestly don't know if I should specialize or if it would be beneficial to do both at the same time. I don't have a degree (yet?) and most people say that you do need to go to school to learn Graphic design and be hireable, I also constantly read that development can be self-learned. So even though I would tend to prefer graphic design, it seems out of reach for the moment.

Any information would be appreciated, thanks !
