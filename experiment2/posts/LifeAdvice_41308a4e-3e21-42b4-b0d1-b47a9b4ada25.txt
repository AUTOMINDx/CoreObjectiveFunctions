How to cope with a new job out of college?
I’ve started a new job and I’m really unsure if I can do it long term. I like the people I work with but the work itself isn’t something I’m passionate about at all. A few people have told me to just stick with it for at least a year but I’m not sure if it’s even a field I would want to stay in. I don’t even know where to go from here though. It’s made me super stressed out and I just don’t know what to do. I’m not at the point where I’m crying every day but I just wait for the weekend to come and it’s an endless cycle. It may just be me still needing to cope with life after college but it’s really hard to find out what exactly is making me feel this way. Any advice on coping strategies or how I can change my mindset?
