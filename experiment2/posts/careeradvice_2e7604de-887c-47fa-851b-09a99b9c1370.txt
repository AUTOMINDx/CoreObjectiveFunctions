Need advice on how to continue with the Master's I selected
I'm not sure if this is the right place to say this. But I didn't know what to do. I'm a master's degree student from a highly prestigious institute. I wanted to be here and study this course so badly. Due to the pandemic, my classes were online for about 2 months. I just came back to campus and have end semester exams in about 2 weeks. It is nothing like I expected. The campus is good, so are the people. It's wonderful here. But the problem is me. I'm not enough for this place. I'm not able to keep up with anything around here. I have a lot of work pending. It's all getting very overwhelming and I'm not sure what to do. Is it just that I'm at a new place and I'll be fine after some time? I'm very close to giving up everything. But there's still a part of me who wants this. I'm just not able to do anything. Maybe it's all in my head and I'm just procrastinating, but if I'm not and I'm actually not at all good at this, I only have a month to leave the course and get a refund(I'm paying a lot of money here).  I've always had people to support me whenever I needed them. But here I'm alone and I honestly have never felt this defeated until now. What can I do? Has anyone here been in this situation? Please help.
