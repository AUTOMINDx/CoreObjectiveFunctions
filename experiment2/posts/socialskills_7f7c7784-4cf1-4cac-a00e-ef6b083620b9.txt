I can't talk to people. I am not shy. I just don't know what to say.
I can't talk to people. I am not shy. I just don't know what to say.
I just don't have an opinion on things and my memory is fucked up.  

I can tell you my age, my height and where i study. Those are a piece of cake. Just simple facts. But i cant tell you how i feel about what i study.   
Or my favourite memory from university.  
Or how i feel about a movie i watched or i book i read.  
 I cant tell you a cool story from my childhood or my favourite color or band because I dont have one.   
Yeah music is cool and some films are interesting but i just forget them.  

I am 25. 5'11". I study Software engineering. And the only opinion i hold strongly is my mind really sucks.
