How do i deal with a toxic family members?
Hi. Since i knew myself, all of my family were toxic. Someone less, somebody more. My parents are saying me: "You'll never be successful." "You'll be homeless." etc, etc. They as well put me competitive behavior with my eldest brother. He is going to get a degree soon for medicine and i choosed a completely different path. They pushed me into job (Thank God, somehow i didn't work a lot this.) that wasn't even profitable. Only job status is for being good looking to other people, while you're feeling bad (if you don't love the job. I didn't.), they gived me a 100$ for school (4 years of educating for this, these were my very depressive times.) and they always say me "We gived you everything, and you're a failure. I wish i never born you." I'm in my 20s, basically, not even full in 20s. My eldest brother got about 15k$ for everything he needs, but still haven't done anything. They always compete me to him and always give him what i ask for. I started to talk about my dream but nobody of them gived attention, so i stopped talking about it. Then, my brother told just a little plan of that and they were so amazed. I felt so bad. Today i am thinking about leaving them and stepping into life alone. Could be under serious financial problems but I'd work something till i have enough to go where i want to. Do you think it would better if i would cut them off? (This is just a small amount of story. If you want to know everything their behavior, please PM me.)
I don't know what this means but it is under rules. TLDR.
