Just diagnosed with thalassemia at age 28
Haven't had any of the symptoms of thalassemia but I'm still really freaking out about it. I have additional labs scheduled for Friday with another appointment with my PCP next Wednesday. They told me I don't really have anything to worry about right now as my lab results came back normal, and that they would advise me on next steps on Wednesday.

I've done some Googling (That's always good, I know...) and it seems that most people diagnosed with it are diagnosed from a pretty young age. Is there anything that I should be concerned about being older and just diagnosed with it?
