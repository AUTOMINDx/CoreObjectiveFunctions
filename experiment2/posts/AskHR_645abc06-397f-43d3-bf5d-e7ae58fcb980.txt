[IA] Promotion question: going from non-exempt to exempt
I work for an insurance company in back office operations. I currently make $42K before overtime. Most weeks I work anywhere from 2-5 hours overtime. Not enough to feel burnt out, by any means.

I applied for a promotion in a different department. It’s salary, exempt. Interviewer said most weeks would not be over 40 hours. I would have to be on a rotation for staying late if needed (twice a month). Some weekends could also be required if there were system updates. (3-4 times per year.)

The salary I was offered was $44K. I replied back to ask for $45K, as I’d be making less without the overtime pay. HR said no. OT is not a guarantee. Their offer was decided by increasing the base pay only. Which I understand. But I’ve been in this job for 9 years. OT is almost always available.

Is my thinking flawed here? Should HR take into account that I’m going to an exempt position?
