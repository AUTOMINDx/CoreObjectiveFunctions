Leaving my husband for the last time
I (31F) have been with my husband (34M) for 14 years. It's been abusive and mostly terrible but I have tried to stick it out for our two kids (HUGE mistake) I've told him I want to break up and he seems to be finally realising I'm serious. He's away for work tonight and the next two nights after that, then he will be back for one more night while he gets his things together, he's very begrudgingly agreed on moving out the next day.

We have separated before and he always seems to be able to convince me I'm doing the wrong thing and make me feel guilty about not wanting to be together.

I'm so scared that just that one night will be enough to scare me into staying with him. I know it could be dangerous to stay there that night but I have two kids, two cats, four dogs and I don't have a car so I really don't have the option of leaving. If I were to pack up his things and not let him stay the night he will be in a complete rage and I don't want my kids to see that.

How the heck am I supposed to be chill for one more goddamn night? I am so, so ready to be away from him that I don't know how I'm going to feel. All I want to do is cry with relief but until that night is actually over and he's really gone, I just feel stuck with this horrible feeling of terror that he won't go and I'll never get away.
