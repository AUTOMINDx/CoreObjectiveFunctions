I almost walked in front of a car today. I’m losing hope.
Hi Reddit. I am newly 20 years old and have struggled with depression since I was 13. It feels like it’s gotten much worse over the years. I am so tired and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to get out of my unhealthy patterns because it makes me feel safe. I started self harming because I had a breakdown so bad I couldn’t contain myself. I am so tired and every day feels like it could be my last. I am tempted to down my antidepressants because I can’t handle being such a burden on everyone.

I have gone to therapy and have visited my doctor multiple times. I just feel like if I ask for help I’ll be seen as weak. I’m just so tired.
