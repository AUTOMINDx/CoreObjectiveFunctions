Interview process [WI]
I’ve had 3 interviews (HR, CEO, leadership team) and received a phone call asking to do a 4th round with a potential subordinate. I was also asked for references. 

Is this a normal process? It feels rather drawn out. I am not sure how many are in the 4th round but there were 3 in the 3rd round. I’ve had references contacted before and I didn’t get the job (called for top 2 and I lost out), so I’m hesitant to give references yet because I don’t want to waste their time.
