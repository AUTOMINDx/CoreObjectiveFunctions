Why can't people just choose if they want to get the covid vaccine or not at their own risk?
I mean, the vaccines are safe and effective from what I gather and Pfizer and Moderna claim to be able to adjust their vaccines to mutations that may arise. Why can't we just get the vaccine (or not) and then just move on?
