Work from home positions to look for as mech eng?
I'm a Mechanical engineer with a few years experience in design and manufacturing environments and with covid kicking up more and more, I'm trying to find a job I can do from home but I'm not sure what to look for in titles. I'm trying to find something that will have me using my education and solving technical problems or doing novel design work. 

What are some keywords I should keep an eye out for in postings?
