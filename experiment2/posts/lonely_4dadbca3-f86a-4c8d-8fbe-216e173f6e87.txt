Anyone wanna befriend me?
I wish I had someone I can talk and relate to, so we won't feel so alone.. I have family but they dont really understand. I am grateful they try and all but I miss social interaction. I havent had a friend especially physically in years do to social anxiety and never a reason to leave the house. I had one friend but they faded away (╯︵╰,)
