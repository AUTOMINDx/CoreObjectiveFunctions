Trying to change careers and I feel like it will never happen for me- teaching to project management?
Sorry I'm really nervous- my first time postingðŸ™ƒ I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Elementary Education. I worked for one year and moved because my spouse is in the military. Since the pandemic, my anxiety has heightened and I feel that maybe teaching isnâ€™t where I should be right now. I want to get into project management. I was looking into the Google Professional Certificate Program, but Iâ€™m not sure that would be enough to get me started in a new field. With that being said: 

-Is it possible for me to get into PM without having a degree? Itâ€™s not something I can afford to do right now, but I wouldnâ€™t be opposed to going back to get one when I can. 

-Is it easy to go into a new career field without a degree? 

-Will people outside of education hire someone with a background like mine for a different career field? If so, which ones?

I donâ€™t know if this helps but currently Iâ€™m not working. Once the holidays are over, I am planning on starting that Google Certificate Program.

Any help would be appreciated. Iâ€™m definitely feeling lostâ€¦ 

Sorry for all of the questions! ðŸ˜¬
