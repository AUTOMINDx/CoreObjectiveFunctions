Help navigating female health issues without insurance?
My partner (25F, Caucasian) is having some issues with excessive bleeding from her periods. She has had a hormonal IUD (Mirena) for a little over 2 years and she was on birth control pills for 4 years prior. Over time her periods have been getting more irregular and heavier. She has minor dull abdominal pains since she got her IUD put in, the pain worsens when she is bleeding. She has been tested for STDs and is negative. We believe that these issues began to appear and gradually worsen over time from beginning birth control. Normal penetrative sex is also sometimes painful for her.

We want to get her issues looked at in a timely manner, but I am at a loss of where to start exactly... She does not have a primary care doctor or insurance at the moment. We will be getting her enrolled this new year though. Is this an issue that I can call a local women's hospital for help? Would Planned Parenthood be the place to call?
