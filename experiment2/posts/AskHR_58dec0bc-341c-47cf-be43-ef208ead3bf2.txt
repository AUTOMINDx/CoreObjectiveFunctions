[WI] Employer forcing everyone to relocated temporarily because of other location severe staffing shortage
I work full time for a company where they have approx. 20 different locations. Nowhere in our contract to my knowledge does it say we can ever be forced to relocate, even temporarily. Another location under our company is short staffed (&lt;50% occupancy). We got an email saying we must all do 2 week rotations at this location, which for many of us is over 2 hours away. 

Is this even legal, and if so is there any way out of it? For example, I get chronic migraines and the insurance company I go through, through same employer, only covers 1 hospital system that is near my current job/home. That hospital system is not anywhere near this temporary location. So if I need to head in to the ER and get a migraine cocktail like I have in the past, I will be SOL. I would have 2 options - somehow beg a friend or coworker to drive me 2 hours to that ER, or just not go and suffer (when I get bad migraines I throw everything up and also cannot walk/talk correctly, many times I am totally bed-ridden). 

It should also be mentioned that I do get travelers diarrhea, and this has caused me to not travel. I frequent only 1 major city outside of my area of living, and it took my body about 30 trips to finally get use to the water in that area. 

Last question - if I simply refuse to relocate for those 2 weeks, and they still say you **must** go, what is the worst thing that could happen? I am assuming termination. Is this something an attorney could get involved in, specifically a mediator/general practice attorney?
