Does it get better?
I don't remember the last time I smiled. All my friends that I used to have ignore me. Therapy hasn't helped. I'm too scared to sleep because of constant nightmares and sleep paralysis. I'm stressing over college. I have so much internalized self hatred. I'm trying my damnedest to find a job so I can eventually move out of my parents house but nothing has come from it yet. I'm only 18 and I'm just assuming this is how adulthood is and I should just get over it but idk.
