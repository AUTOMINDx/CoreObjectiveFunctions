Showing Dominance
Good Day ladies and Gentlemen  
Well, this is awkward and im not sure if im getting the answer im looking for here but i gotta ask  
or atleast try.  


Anyway my Issue  


Me and Feyonce, we are happy together there are no real problems.  


But my Darling said that i could be more Dominant.  
And im not talking about like Physical Strength or Body language  
That is not my Question or the Topic.  


Im looking for answer regarding Speech i suppose.  
Like for example. One time, an actual Quote "You don´t even need your voice, even text would be enough" or that i need to find a Balance between Dominance and how i am Normally.  


I mean i got so many Questions like:  


When, is the right time  
or What to say, like what kind of Dominance   
taking in the lead in something or how should i make the Person feel.  


Im trying to connect the Dots and i am getting some kind of Picture myself but  
it ain´t easy.   
Im thinking about it alot  and i really wanna achieve this cuz well if i put my mind into something i  
usually accomplish it but so far i just hit  a roadblock.  


or an other example   
"Normally": Im a chill, calm, having little bit of an Ego (but in a Ironic way and not Serious meant)  


but when im supposed to be Dominant: I should act different, like finding a Balance between this and.....well something else, what is that "something else"  


  
So many Questions.  


I really don´t like asking for help but here i am and i hope i find and answer and hopefully this isn´t  
too weird what im spitting out.  


This is my first ever Reddit Question so yeah.  


Sorry for any rookie mistakes.
