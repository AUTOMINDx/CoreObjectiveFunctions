I could just turn off my Wi-Fi.
I can't see any of my friends in real life, but we don't talk online either really. I could just turn off my Wi-Fi. I want to talk to them, but they don't seem to be interested in talking to me anymore.

I could just disappear. I could just turn it off, and I wouldn't be able to be a burden to them anymore, and instead of wondering when they'd get back to me, I'd just know that they weren't going to. I'd know that if I sent them a message, it would never go through so it would be pointless.

I'd be a bit more lonely, and I really don't need to be even more lonely, but if I'm going to be either way, maybe that way is better.

Plus I'd get to spend a ton of one-on-one time with the person that I hate most on this god forsaken planet. Myself.

Sometimes I wish I had never even existed in the first place.
