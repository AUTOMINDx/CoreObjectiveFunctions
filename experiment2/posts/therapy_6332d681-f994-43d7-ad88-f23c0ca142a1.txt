I don’t know If I should go to therapy.
I seriously don’t know If I should go to therapy. I have thoughts of self harm, but don’t do it. I have deep insecurities that affect my mental health, but my physical well-being is alright. I mean everyone has insecurities.I have problems, but don’t know whether they are serious enough I need therapy. I’ve never been to a therapist, what if they tell me that my problems aren’t serious enough? I’m just here to ask whether if I went to a therapist, would they turn me down?
