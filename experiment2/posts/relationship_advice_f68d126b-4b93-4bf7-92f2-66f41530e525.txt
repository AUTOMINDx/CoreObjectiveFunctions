My boyfriend’s female friend is overstepping their boundaries &amp; is a bully towards me.
Alright so I’ve been having an issue that has been eating away at me and I am not sure what to do or how to handle this. 

I have a boyfriend who is an amazing guy and is basically the dude everyone would like to have as a friend.

We are both 25 &amp; have been best friends since the middle school. Towards the end of high-school till 22 years old, we drifted a little since we were both in relationships ( I was in a very unhealthy one, my ex was very insecure, toxic&amp; unreasonable) and I couldn’t see my bestfriend at the time.

As time passed &amp; I broke up with my ex, my best friend and I picked up where we left off &amp; started hanging. We started dating in 2018 then a year later we officially got together and have been happy ever since. 

Here are quick bullet points about us before diving in:

My boyfriend:

* He's extremely mellow by nature.
* He's nonjudgmental, sees the best in everyone
* He's extremely loyal and respectful towards his friends and women in general
* He's a clear and honest communicator.
*He won't compromise his values or beliefs for anyone ( a very “I’m going to do me” despite how someone else feels mentality)

Me:
* I'm pretty smart, diplomatic, &amp; a very nice person( a little too nice where people either walk all over me or take advantage)
* I’m a pretty good judge of character and have been spot on multiple times
* I'm not a jealous person and know that I can't change someone or dictate how to live their life.
* If there is a conflict, I always scrutinize my feelings and perspective before the other person's.

Moving on….
My boyfriend lived the best college life and has a TON of female friends ( he has even lived with some good female friends from college while we were dating.) I never had any issues or problems with anyone or had the slightest thought that one of his female friends had bad blood against me. They were very inclusive and never made me feel unwanted, excluded or uncomfortable.

However, my boyfriend has this female friend that he has known from Junior year in high school, that I have met a few months before we have even started dating. We will call her Steph. She is very funny, beautiful, and outgoing- who also knows a few of my boyfriends cousins (they have partied together &amp; they love her bc they have the same personality).

We have all gone out and spent time together, while I was dating my boyfriend, and I couldn’t help but get a different vibe from Steph. 

At First, I thought she was just getting a little territorial and I would just shrug it off. However, her questionable behavior increased more and more. 

She would:
*Shun me out from conversations 
*If I am talking she will talk over me
*Put me down in convos very subtlety 
*obnoxiously say “ my boyfriend is his best friend” to everyone
*Take pictures with my boyfriend and never with me
*Always gets super close to my boyfriend and touches his arm while talking to him
*When leaving somewhere with my boyfriend, she would give me a pat goodbye ( sometimes just a wave) after bracing my boyfriend with a huge hug goodbye.
*befriends everyone but me

The worst part is that No one else notices this behavior because 1. It is not happening to them and 2. Everyone loves her bc she is funny, beautiful and outgoing. As for me, I am not as much fun to be around compared to her. 

Ive really tried to get to know her too, while giving her the benefit of the doubt, &amp; giving it time to see if anything would change, but her behavior towards me is still persisting.

I hate to say this too but sometimes when my boyfriend &amp; Steph are standing or sitting next to one another, they are always so close, as if they are constantly touching one another or brushing off one another. I find that extremely uncomfortable and a huge red flag. Every time I see them together like that, it strikes a chord in me. 

I understand that guys can’t catch these things and like to be given that kind of attention, I get it, we all like it. Although, it gives me the impression that they get way too cozy with one another. I have a few guy friends and I have never acted the way they do towards one another, especially if they have a girlfriend.Its called f*cking boundaries and respect.

Sidenote; I've mentioned once to my boyfriend when we first started dating that I think Steph likes him but he didn’t say anything in response. Ever since then, I haven’t pushed the issue any further and have never complained about Steph to him, however she is now starting to  bother me more and more and I don’t think I can handle it if nothing changes.

I would never tell or expect my boyfriend to stop being friends with some one since that is so wrong &amp; not anyone’s place  —- However In this case, I just want my boyfriend to be aware &amp; mindful- that Steph is crossing boundaries that make me very uncomfortable and somewhat a bully towards me. At the end of the day he is the one who can kind of put a foot down and nudge her in a way of telling her whats cool and what’s not, or else she will keep doing it bc in a way it seems like my boyfriend is egging her on &amp; condoning her behavior.

Again, he is very loyal to his friends, &amp; tends to have the I don’t care mentality at times, when something is not affecting him.  So basically I’m worried for him to say”Thanks for telling me but nothing is going to change and I am going to still hang out with Steph, despite how you feel about her.” ( ok maybe not exactly like that but similar)

Ive been going through this over and over in my head trying to make sure that what im feeling is valid and I’m not letting jealousy or fear cloud my judgement. I have talked to my family as well about this to reassure I am not being a crazy gf who is overthinking.

In a nutshell, is this normal &amp; appropriate that I feel this way? Am i approaching it the right way? I am really not sure what to do or tell my boyfriend. I have had my share of bullies in my past that has damaged my confidence but Steph gives me anxiety and makes me feel 2 feet tall. What do I do!? :/
