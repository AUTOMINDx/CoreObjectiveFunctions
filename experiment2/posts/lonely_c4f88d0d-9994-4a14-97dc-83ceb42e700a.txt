Getting compliments but nothing really happens...
This is my first time posting on this sub, not even sure if this is a vent or not .

It somewhat infuriates me when people compliment me but I know it's lies. An example is when my mother keeps saying "your so handsome!". She's my mother and she loves me more than she can express but still, Imagine being called handsome but no other woman takes interest in you!

Another one is when I was working at a zoo this summer and after helping people, some of them would say "your going to be a great dad!". I had to smile to be nice but, inside I asked myself "well how come I haven't gotten in a relationship yet?". Don't get me wrong I appreciate their compliments because I know they meant it but still.
