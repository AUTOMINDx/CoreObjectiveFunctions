First conference presentation
I'm really nervous about my first talk tomorrow, I've not even been to an in person conference before due to covid so I don't even know the dress code. I'm pretty happy with my slides and am going to spend a couole of hours in the morning doing run throughs. Any tips greatly appreciated!
