33M No motivation, depressed, bad financial situation... In fair of becoming homeless
I'm 33 and unemployed, no car, things are deteriorating with my gf, whom I rely on for housing... I just dunno what to do and I just need advice, is there any way I can work online or anything? I live in Oklahoma City and there's not really anywhere I could walk to and there's no public transit.... Just really down and out and could use some advice, please and thank you
