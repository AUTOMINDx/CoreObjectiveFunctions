Ex Best Men if Reddit, What Advice Would You Give a Soon to Be Best Man?
To keep it simple, I've been asked by a long time friend to be his best man. The wedding is coming up soon. Nothing crazy fancy, but not a backyard wedding, either. Formal Dress, fancy-yet-common venue, 80 people or less. I don't know very much of his family, and I know only his fiance and her father on that side. I'm walking in blind and slightly broke after paying for all the necessities thus far. 

I'm looking for words of wisdom...things you wish you would have known or done before you played your roll as 'Best man' at an old friend's wedding. We're in our early 30s, if that helps, and we're really not all that close these days, I've just been a long time friend and he doesn't have a very large friend circle to choose from. He's a little bit socially awkward, and I'm not sure how he's going to handle a big social event where he is one of the stars of the show. I'm not very social myself, but I can play a roll pretty well when I need to. I'm more concerned about him than myself when it comes down to our rolls in this event. I've worked a lot of weddings as a banquet server during college,so I know my way around a wedding.

Ok, go! And thanks in advance!
