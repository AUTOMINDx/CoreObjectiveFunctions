How soon do you know if a job truly isn’t a good fit for you?
Using a throwaway. 

So yesterday was my first day at my first full time job. After yesterday and this morning, I’m feeling very very overwhelmed. I know it’s probably jitters and nerves but I feel some of the expectations this positions has has changed from when I was interviewed to when I started yesterday. 

They had told me in chunks what the duties were, but some aspects are a lot more than what was originally said. Most of these quite frankly don’t match my qualifications because I haven’t done them yet. 

I don’t want to fail myself but I also don’t want to fail the company, but I also don’t want to burn a bridge so quickly despite me thinking for my own personal interest and the organization’s. 

Hoping I don’t cry at work again today. Wish me luck.
