Gf and I on a break, she’s deleted all photos of me?
I know what the standard answer is “break = it’s over” but this one is weird. We spent about an hour on the phone with each other, she said she needed space to figure out who she is now (she’s moved away from our hometown and is having a bit of a crisis). I explained to her that’s fine but if you come back in a few weeks and I’ve moved on don’t blame me for it - I refuse to sit around and depend on someone else to make me happy. The conversation ended with her crying a lot, both saying I love you and that’s it. She even messaged me after telling me she loves me but need time to figure shit out.
The next day she’d deleted almost all photos of me off her social media’s?? 
I don’t really know what to do, I’m not even 100% sure if I want her back or if it’s just because I’m used to spending so much time with someone.
