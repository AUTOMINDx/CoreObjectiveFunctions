How does a lever actually works?
i don't mean the simple description of what happens when you put an effort on a side of the lever to lift and object. What i don't get is how does a minimal effort can lift a heavier object? i mean if u want to lift 50kg u got to put the same weight but in opposite way and in a lever u just put less effort than what it's needed. where does the other force comes from?
