Give a gift of History with the AskHistorians 2021 Holiday Book Recommendation Thread!
Happy holidays to one of the most fantastic communities on the net!


Itâ€™s been a heck of a year for everyone, but perhaps we can brighten it up a bit. I figured we should run this thread a bit early, considering all the problems with shipping and stuff selling out happening right now.


Tis coming up to the season for gift giving, and its a safe bet that folks here both like giving and receiving all kinds of history books. As such we offer this thread for all your holiday book recommendation needs!

If you're going to recommend a book, please don't just drop a link to a book in this thread--that will be removed.
