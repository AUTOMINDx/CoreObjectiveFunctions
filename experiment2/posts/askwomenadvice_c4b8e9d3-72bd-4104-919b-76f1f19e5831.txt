Major Pregnancy Dilemma in a conservative country with laws against abortion ( took the pill, what are the signs that plan b works?)
Here's my story:

I'm a young teenager living in my parent's house and had engaged in some grinding and humping naked with my boyfriend and he pre-cummed and this happened on the day I was ovulating. 
My only option was to buy Plan B levenogestral since ella is not available in my region.
I don't have any other options related to abortion due to them being illegal in a conservative region and family I live in and I'm super paranoid right now.

Are there any signs that plan b wouldnt work and implantation is happening.
Other than my period occuring are there some other signs that the pill is working since the signs of the pill and implantation can be very similar. Are there any differences?
