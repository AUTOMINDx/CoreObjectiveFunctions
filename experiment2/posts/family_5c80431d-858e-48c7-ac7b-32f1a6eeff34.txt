Is my friend's "family dynamic" really that weird?
So I've always had this friend (since preschool) whose house I practically lived in. She and I would spend hours playing with her toys while her mom would cook us food. Her parents divorced when she was three, and around her 14th birthday she got a step-dad. The guy is great, she even calls him pa'. I won't pretend like her parent's divorce was pretty - cause it wasn't - but I never really saw her care about that kind of stuff. 

But here's the "weird" thing... Around the time her step-dad got engaged to her mom, her dad came back trying to mend bridges. Apparently *his* new fiance had got him to attend some therapy sessions. I wasn't allowed in her house during those first weeks, so she would come to *my* house instead, or just hang out in the park. A lot of things happened throughout the years (mostly sessions with family/child therapists) and now she has three little brothers to brag about. One toddler by her mom and step-dad, with twins by her dad and step-mom. 

They all live in the same home, since both her birth parent's are very wealthy people *~~and their house looks like a victorian villa~~*. We're now in college, and she called me saying her project group-mates were making her uncomfortable. Since the project is supposed to be one of those "get to now your classmates" type projects, they were expected to talk about their families. Apparently they all gave her weird looks and claimed her parents raised her in a "toxic environment". I asked her how she felt about it, and she confessed that growing up the way she did always felt "normal" or "right", so she never really gave it a second thought. What do you guys think?

TL;DR: My friend was raised in the same house by her divorced parents + step-parents and has three siblings being raised the same way. Is that weird?
