Needy grandma
I (24f) don’t know what to do. My grandma (82) lives alone. I am my grandmothers only grandkid. My dad (who lived with her as well for the past decade) passed last year so it’s been hard for her, but it’s been very hard for me too to grieve since that was obviously my father. 
Since my dad passed my grandmas health had declined and has been asking myself and her nieces to constantly help around her house each day. Yard work, watering her massive amount of flowers, trash day, taking her dog for a walk, laundry, changing her bed sheets, ETC. 

Now, my grandma has swollen hands and feet/diabetes neuropathy but refuses to seek emergency medical attention. She lets the doctors schedule another appointment a week in advance. My grandma is very stubborn and the only one I have left. 

My big issue is I am working a lot of extra days for peak (1am shifts, 6 days a week) AND I am in college full time online. I want to help my grandma but I don’t know how to tell her I cannot handle helping her 1+ times a week any longer, plus she lives 30 minutes away. I wish she had pre-planned arrangements ahead of time, but now I feel it’s crucial for me to step in but I don’t know how to basically say I can’t help her anymore. I feel like this is all beyond my control at this point and there is no resolution to her comfort, happiness and never ending need of assistance. Anyone have any similar stories to this or advice please???
