AITA for not helping my little sister with her chores?
I (16f) was home alone with my younger sister (11f). Our parents left us both a list of chores they expected us to have done when they got home. 

I quickly finished my chores so I would have time to do other things, but my little sister chose to wait. About two hours before our parents got home I reminded her of the list and she told me she would wait a few more minutes because she was doing something.  

Nothing else was said till I got a text from my mom saying how they were going to come home earlier than usual because of an incident that happened. I told my little sister about the text and she instantly started with her chores. 

A few minutes later she asked me if I could help her finish the list. I told her no because she waited until they were almost home to start. She got mad at me saying that she didn't think they would be home early. 

We continued to argue and I ended up telling her that it's the consequences of her own actions. 

When our parents got home she told them that I didn't help her with chores after she asked me too. My mom said I was being 'immature' and that I should've helped her because that's what good siblings do. 

I felt as though I did the right thing, but my mom thinks that I was being immature. So, AITA?
