How do i make new friends without having any at the moment
So basically i turned 14 2 months ago, Im an 8th grader. All my ex friend groups have let me down over the years so im kinda lonely
Even my current group is kinda tearing apart into smaller groups, the whole group hasn t gone out in months.

I recently started going out to like the center of my city. There are lots of teenagers in the area that go out to have fun.
Tbh my goal is to like get to talk to more girls and maybe then get into their group of friends i guess.
I ve had  a few chats there but only with girls. I got  a few @ and 1 number.


The 2 biggest problems Im facing at the moment are that
1. Most of the girls that go there, usually stay in bigger groups, its kinda hard to meet someone thats by herself, 
The girls that ive talked to were from groups of 3. 

2. Since Im 14, im a bit younger than most people there. 
It helps a lot that i have a deep voice and im 6'1. But most people there are at least 16-17 which is makes it a bit hard to keep a convo or "accept" for me to spend time with them that night

I dont know if I should look for a friend group first or maybe get to talk to a lot of girls first. or even look for a relationship
How should i approach the problem? What could I do about it?
