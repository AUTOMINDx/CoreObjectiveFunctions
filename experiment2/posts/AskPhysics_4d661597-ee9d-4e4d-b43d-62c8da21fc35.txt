Help calculating mass from Gravitational Time Dilation
Hi!

I'm trying to backwards-calculate the mass of a "black hole" from a novel (Wheel of Time). Just a fun exercise for a video. 

Here is my attempt: https://i.imgur.com/qaY0fVE.jpeg

I think this is okay, but I was hoping to get another set of eyes on it. 

We only have some rough estimates of the time differences between time near the singularity and time for an outside observer. 

So tf ≈ 5 days, while t0 ≈ 2-3 hrs. 

After that, the distance from the center of mass to the observer is about, r ≈ 1600km. Though, I was reading that this r should be in **Schwarschild Coordinates**. I never took special relativity in my degree, so I'm not too familiar with these. 

Can someone help me out with this? Thanks in advance!
