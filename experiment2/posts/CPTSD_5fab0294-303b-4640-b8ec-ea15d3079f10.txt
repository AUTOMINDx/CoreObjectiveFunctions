“Don’t be Sorry”
I saw a tweet today that really resonated with me, and I believe it belongs here. 

“Don’t be sorry for speaking up about what was hurting you. Don’t be sorry for the way your body responds to the past. Don’t be sorry for needing more than what’s accessible. Don’t be sorry for taking breaks. Don’t be sorry that your story is too much for some. Don’t be sorry.”
