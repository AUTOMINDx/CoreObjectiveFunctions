Can men wait for marriage?
Like, non-religious men. 

I grew up with my family telling me that men don’t fall in love, they just want to have sex and maybe after marriage love happens.

I’m so confused, because nowadays everyone is having sex and i want to wait. 

Do men actually fall in love? Like emotionally without having sex? Or is it more complicated? 

And will they wait for marriage? 

(Please no one take offense to the way i word things i just don’t know any other way)
