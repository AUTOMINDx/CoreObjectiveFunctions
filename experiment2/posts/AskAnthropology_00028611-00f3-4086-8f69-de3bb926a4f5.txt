Difference between Anthropology and Ethnography
Hi, I was wondering if anyone could guide me on how anthropology differs from ethnography? I'm considering majoring in anthro, after studying journalism, and i wanna know how other people think anthro differs from ethno and even historical archival work or journalistic work. Any guidance is appreciated!
