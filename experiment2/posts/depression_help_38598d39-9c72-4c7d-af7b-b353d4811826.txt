Don't feel like i deserve to be heard
Ironic, I suppose, that I'm posting this here, but I just don't feel like I deserve to be heard. I've spent the better part of the day posting statuses to Facebook and then immediately deleting them before anyone could see and respond. My gf handed me the remote and asked me what i wanted to watch and I just flicked around all the apps on the roku for 20+ minutes without actually opening any, and then just put the remote down, and laid facing the wall all night. After she fell asleep, I even wrote her a text message saying how much I wish i could be as strong as her, and then deleted the message before I could even send it.

I just hate myself, I feel like if I could just somehow delete myself from everyone's memories, everybody would be a lot better off and happier, and I feel like I don't even deserve to be heard when I'm trying to describe how I hurt.
