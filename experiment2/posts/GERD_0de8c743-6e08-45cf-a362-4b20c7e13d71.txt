Gerd/Acid reflux issues
I am 28 never had issues with my stomach ever and suddenly one day i started having breathing problems. I initially had no idea what it was but then somebody mentioned gerd and I realized i have also been belching when the breathing problems hit. I have tried prilosec and pepcid Ac and they work leading me to believe it is some form of gerd. But once I finished the 2 week dose it came back. How long does it take for my stomach to settle down and go back to normal? Should i continue to take prilosec another 14 days? Maybe my stomach just needs more time to heal?
