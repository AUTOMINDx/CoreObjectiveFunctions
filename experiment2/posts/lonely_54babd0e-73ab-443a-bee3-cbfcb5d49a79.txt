It's easy to say "Get help" when you have people in your life that are willing to help you. Tough luck otherwise.
Last night I had a conversation with my ex and one of the things he said to me was that "he wished I get help". As if it that was as easy as just saying it out loud. 

I don't have anyone in my life that can understand the stuff that I'm going through. My family's way of solving problems it's just literally not dealing with them or dealing with them through alcohol and other substances, so they're out, and I don't have any friends I can rely on, so I could tell them just about my fucking day.

The only people I can talk to it's my therapist, and oh surprise, I don't see her more than one hour every two weeks, so good luck me with trying to cram two weeks in a conversation that lasts less than an hour.

It's just me. Have been like this since a long time now, and that's not changing anytime soon. How am I supposed to get help then when I can't even have someone to talk casually? It's just so fucking tiring and frustrating when they make it seem so easy. If they could only be in your fucking shoes for a day.
