What antidepressant worked for you?
Obviously I’m not going to make life choices based off of advices from strangers but the Prozac I’m on doesn’t help. All it does is make me feel like a robot. I want to enjoy things again.

There’s a difference between SSRI’s that turn you into a robot and SSRI’s that actually start making you return to a serotonin-equilibrium again and things return to normal. What did that for you?
