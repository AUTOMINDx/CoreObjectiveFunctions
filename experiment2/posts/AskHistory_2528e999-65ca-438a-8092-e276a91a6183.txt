What's up with the swastikas on Mannlichers?
I recently bought an Austrian M95 stripper clip thinking it was from the First World War, only to notice a faded but unmistakable swastika and eagle stamp on the clip. Did the Nazis use Mannlichers, and if so, did they produce their own, or turn old pieces into militia weapons in the closing days of the Reich? Thanks!
