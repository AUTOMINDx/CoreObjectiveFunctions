Apparently my new thing is sleeping so I don’t have to do things
Don’t want to deal with a problem right now? Sleep. Hungry but can’t decide what to eat and cooking is too much work anyway? Fuck it, don’t eat anything, just go to sleep.

I went to bed at 6pm last yesterday and woke up at 4pm. My sleep pattern is completely wrecked, I’m not eating anywhere near enough (and at 86 lbs I really can’t afford to lose weight) and I really don’t know what to do about it. I’ve been depressed on and off for a very long time but this time it’s different. I have no idea how to deal with this.

I don’t want to go to my doctor about this because I don’t want to be nuisance. I mean, it’s not an emergency and there are probably lots of people with more urgent problems, so I shouldn’t take up time and resources if it’s not necessary.

Is there anything I can do about this? I feel like this is never going to go away.
