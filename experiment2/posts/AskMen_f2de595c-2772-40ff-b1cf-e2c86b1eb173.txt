What do I do if get into some confrontational situation on a first date?
So I was out on a first date with a girl and some random guy I mistakenly bumped into goes "the words are excuse me m*f*" and I responded "sorry could you repeat that?" Cause I genuinely didn't hear him and I looked at my date and she just said sorry to that guy and pulled me out of there. I realized what happened a few moments later but I wonder if it made me look bad. Now that I'm typing this I know how ridiculous this sounds but do you guys have any similar stories where you got into a confrontation on the first date? What do you do? Getting into a fight would obviously be too much but running away is bad too.
