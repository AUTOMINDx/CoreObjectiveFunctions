I don't know how much longer I can handle living with myself
This is the worst I've ever felt so far. Last night I almost had to call 911 again because my episode got so bad. I'm really humiliated over it but I was having intrusive violent thoughts. I was watching a true crime show and suddenly just had them pop into my head, about hurting my pets and my family. I would never actually do that, they're the only things keeping me going. I have no idea why I thought about it but now I'm terrified of myself. I can't stop hyperfixating on it. It's always something new, I was convinced I had cancer, then was convinced I had dementia, and now I'm convinced that I'm a closeted psychopath who is pretending to care about their family. I've just been sobbing all night. I can't remember the last time I've truly felt normal. Everyday is a new obsession and with every new thing I come closer and closer to fully losing it. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I'm just so scared. Every medication I've tried has made things that much worse so where do I even go from here? Clearly I can't handle it myself... I'm scared that it won't be long before I hurt myself. I feel so cripplingly alone. Usually I have my family to talk to, but how am I supposed to tell them what happened last night? I just wish I knew what was wrong with me, even my friends with anxiety are nowhere near where I am. I feel so alone
