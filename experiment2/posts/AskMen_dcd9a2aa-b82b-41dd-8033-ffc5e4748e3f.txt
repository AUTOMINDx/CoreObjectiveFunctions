How do I cut my own hair?
I usually get a taper and cut some off the top when I to the barber about every 3-4 weeks. I want to learn how to cut my own hair to save money because it’s $30 every time I go. How should I start cutting my hair and what tools do I need for tapers/fades? I watched a few videos on YouTube but I’m not tryna mess up my hair
