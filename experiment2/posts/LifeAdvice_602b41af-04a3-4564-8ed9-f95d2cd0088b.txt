Life
I’m 19, thinking about going to school for a Associates degree in cyber security. I’m also open to other career paths. I’m looking at only two years of school, that’s how much I can afford. I just know IT fields can pay great. I’m young and open minded to anything. So if anyone has any career advice, feel free to drop it.
