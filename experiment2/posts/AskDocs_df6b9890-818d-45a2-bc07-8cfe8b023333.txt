Underweight... Is my weight a health concern?
I'm a **5'0 14F weighing approx 82 lbs**. I always figured I was extremely underweight and that this is unhealthy for me, obviously it's difficult for me to put on weight despite being conscious of it.

During my most recent visit to my family physician, I  asked them if they had any concerns about my weight. They said that my weight was actually perfect for my height, and explained that most people are just overweight, and that's what causes me to be thinner in comparison.

Can any doc confirm this is really true? Also, would it be unhealthy for me exercise? I am afraid of losing weight doing so.

PS: I don't have any eating disorders. And I apologize, but I wasn't sure what subreddit to ask this on. This seemed to be the best-fitting one I could find.
