Changing Your Perception of Time
I was listening to Stephen West's "Philosophize This!" on Simulacra and Simulation. A point was brought up that our view on reality is partly because of our linear time perception

I can't remember the finer details, but it was wigging me out. In a good way

Have any of you thought about how we could view time differently? Has anyone attempted to integrate this view into their life? If so, what happened?

What might your reality look like if you made this change?
