Anyone else relate?
My nmom- Why are you constantly hidden in your room and on your phone? Why are you so anti social? We're gonna turn off the wifi so you can be more part of the family!

Me *goes into living room* 

My mom after 30 minutes- Finds 100 things to yell at everyone about and picks a fight with every person in the house and blames everyone for being crazy and loud when no else can get a word in.

Yeah, can't solve this mystery guys, no idea why I like sitting in my room all day.
