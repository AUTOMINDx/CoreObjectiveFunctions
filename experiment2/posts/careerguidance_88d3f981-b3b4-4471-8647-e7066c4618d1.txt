Is it possible to hate the job you love?
I think it is. I love my job and I love my company. It's got everything I wanted and I couldn't ask for more...

But there are just days (or weeks) where it feels so exhausting. It's like the work doesn't stop and there are days when you feel alone in your team. Sometimes, it feels like you are carrying the load. And there are times where it feels hard to take a break because you know there's so many things going on and leaving would just mean more work after.

If you're reading this and you feel the same way, this is a reminder to take care of yourself! Get the rest you need and take care of your life away from work.
