I just wanna die
If even one person is reading this, please give me some advice that isn’t “drink some water” or “exercise”. I’m just sick of it all. And the only thing that’s stopping me is leaving my mom, boyfriend of 2 1/2 years, and my dog and them being sad? And then I think to my self, it’s either me being sad, or them being sad so which one do I pick. Told my mom I’m depressed and suicidal and she called me selfish. Selfish that I want to just not be sad anymore? Yea I guess so because then more people are going to be sad. But I just can’t take it anymore. I’m 18 and don’t have a job, don’t go to school (taking a gap year), and don’t have any friends. I live with my boyfriend and have a routine schedule of waking up early to make him lunch for work, he goes to work while I sleep, then I walk my dog, he comes home very late (works from 8am-sometimes as late as 7:30pm), after he comes home from work he goes to sleep until the next day. I don’t have any friends, I don’t have a life, I just can’t take it anymore. I just wanna die already. :)
