Did I compliment a co-worker on her appearance in appropriately? How should one do it these days?
Reading another post about what was acceptable 20 years ago that isn't acceptable now and this came to mind from earlier this year.

I have a co-worker we're both in our late 40s.  She's a single mom and I'm married.  She normally dresses well and professional looking.  That day, she came in just before Easter with her hair having been in curlers, full makeup and dressed much more fancy.

She came by to ask me something, I did a double take and I recall saying "Fancy.... wow! You look really good!".  Going from straight to voluminous and feathered curls really dazzled me and I think I stared or looked her over a little too long.   But just like with everyone else in the office, she thanked me and talked a bit about wanting to dress up for the holiday.

We proceeded to get back down to work with what she wanted and stared at a computer screen with me pointing at things. Out of the corner of my eye and in the reflection of the screen, she's turned her head and looking at me up and down.

Nothing further came of it since but that other post about past behaviours that are currently unacceptable reminded me of it and I wondered if the second look she gave me was for me having done somehting.

What should be the proper way to compliment a woman who went beyond her usual manner of dressing or does one say nothing as a male?
