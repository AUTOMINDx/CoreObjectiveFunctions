26 and not sure what to do
Hey guys! I’ve (26F) been in the closet for a decade. I’ve been living with my current partner for the last 2 years and we’ve been dating for 3. I’ve worked so hard on keeping it a secret from my dad. 

My mom knew I was gay, but told me to never tell my dad. Lots of homophobia growing up. I agreed and didn’t think it would be a big deal. She passed away 4 years ago and since we lost her, my dad has changed so much. He’s so much more open-minded and kind. He congratulated my cousin on her girlfriend and has told me multiple times that he wouldn’t care if my brother or I are gay. 

I mean it kind of sounds like he knows but I really don’t think he does. Anyway, the crux of the story is that he’s coming to visit me this weekend. He knows we lived in a one bedroom together and knows we are renting a house together (as friends!). I don’t know how I can hide it anymore if he wants to come in the house and think I need to come to terms with the fact that I have to come out to him. 

I’m terrified. The years of homophobic rhetoric scarred me, and while the changes I think are permanent, I can’t get rid of my old fears. I still rely on my dad financially and will until I finish medical school. FWIW, my brother has known for like 8 years.
