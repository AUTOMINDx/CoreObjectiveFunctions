Homeless (f32) because of my abusive ex boyfriend (m35). I don't know what to do.
If you read my old posts you will know what I've been through with my ex. About a year ago I left him after months of abuse and I thought that would be it but it wasn't. For the past couple of months he has stalked me, threatened me, broke into my house twice and because of all of this I had to move twice. This last move forced me to disappear, I couldn't contact my family who is hours away from me, I had no one. I lost my job because of Covid and all my savings are gone because of the moving and everything I had to do to try to protect myself. I became so traumatized by this whole thing that I became unable to function, I have several panic attacks a day and I developed agoraphobia. Because of that I lost my job at the fast food place I was working at. My mental health got worse, I couldn't afford therapy or a psychiatrist and eventually tried to kill myself. After months of struggling I'm now homeless. In three days I will be at a homeless shelter but until then I'm on the streets. I spend my days at the mall, where I go to the bathroom, charge my phone and if I'm lucky I'll get a meal from a stranger. The worst of all is that my ex found me again, he found my old place and I'm not there now but it's still scary that he figured out the city and can find me if he wants. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and is considered dangerous, he was kept at a mental hospital for 3 months if I'm not mistaken and as soon as he got out the nightmare started again. I needed to vent, I have no one to talk to and I don't really know what to do. I'm alone, having severe panic attacks and I don't even have a bed to sleep on. I can't stop crying because this doesn't feel real.
