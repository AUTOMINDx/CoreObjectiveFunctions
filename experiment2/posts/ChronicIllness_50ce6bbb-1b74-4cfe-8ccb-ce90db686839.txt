I’m not sure if my previous post posted so I’m reposting just in case
sorry for the repost I was just wondering if these are normal symptoms ?Lately I’ve been wondering and questioning myself about the symptoms I’ve been experiencing. Since most of my symptoms probably can be explained by anxiety, I don’t know if I should finally go to the doctor about what I’ve been experiencing. 
I don’t really have any completely unusual symptoms either 
Mostly I’ve been experiencing really weird fluctuations in my heart beat (I think tachycardia/bradycardia although I’m not sure if that has to be diagnosed), nausea, chest pain , joint + muscle pain, headaches, dizziness and just general unwellness. What’s so confusing is that those symptoms are so broad that it could be anything. Anyone know how I can kind of find out/ narrow it down? Thank u so much for reading
