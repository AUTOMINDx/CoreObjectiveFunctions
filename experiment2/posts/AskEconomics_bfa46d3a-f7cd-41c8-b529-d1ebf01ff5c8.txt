Are all central banks created equal?
I think it's safe to say that, generally speaking, most countries' Central Banks are run by economic experts and are usually safely decoupled from the government enough to do their job effectively. 

With that being said, why do central banks take fairly different actions when presented with similar scenarios? E.g. ECB putting negative rates when the US Federal Reserve expressed no interest in doing so, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raising rates to counter inflation even though the Federal Reserve believes inflation to be transitory and to wait things out a bit longer before a rate hike. 

Is this difference just in mentality towards different scenarios? Is it a difference in expertise? *Are* there differing level of expertise among central banks? A lot of people seem to give the Federal Reserve grief for QE and related stimulus, but the ECB is engaging with these activities as well, are they not? 

Any help or literature pointing to comparisons would be great.
