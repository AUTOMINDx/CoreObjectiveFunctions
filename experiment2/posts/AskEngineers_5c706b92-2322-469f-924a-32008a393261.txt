Looking for career advice
I'm looking for some advice on possible career advancement options. I'm a software controls engineer with a little over 10 years of experience in my field. Basically my job entails designing electrical panels and Allen Bradley plc/hmi based software for automation equipment. I've worked in packaging and medical device assembly for OEM equipment manufacturers. I design the equipment, start it up, and install/work on it in the field.

As I said, I've worked in this position for 10 years. I'm looking for advice on where to go with my career. I do enjoy most of my job and the technical aspects of it. I'm not the biggest fan of field work however and I know I'll eventually want to stop that part in the future. Most of the things I read online suggest that many move into management, whether it be a Project Manager, an Engineering Manager, or something similar. 

However, I'm not sure I have the demeanor or patience to actually manage people or deal with customers in a business format. I work for a smaller company currently, so I don't have many examples to look at for possible career growth. Can anyone give me some possible ideas for advancement in a technical direction that I could look to in the future?

Thanks!
