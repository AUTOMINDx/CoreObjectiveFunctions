Stomach pain and averse to food
\[20F - 5'6" - 130\~ lbs\]

Hello!

For the past week or so, I've been struggling with intense stomach pain. Along with that, I can't seem to eat anything without nausea and food repulsion, even with foods I love. I've tried alternatives like protein shakes and light foods, but those trigger it too. I can't afford to visit a doctor at the moment and don't have insurance. I haven't had any history with health issues and do not take any medications. Any advice would be appreciated!
