AITA for telling my mom she should stop interacting with my friends if she can't watch what she says?
So my mom (she's 60) bas very strong opinions on a lot of things I view differently. I decided to stop debating or talking about them with her a while ago since our discussions aren't goimg anywhere. Today I (f/20) invited my friend (f/19) over. My mom knew and she usually never has a problem with my friends comming over here and there.
Now my friend is in recovery from anorexia (she's doing very well may I add) and my mom knows this.

While my mom was prepearing her lunch (I already ate bc I had to go to work soon) she asked my friend if she liked to eat that food and she said no bc it had onions and chives in it. She doesn't like the consistency of it and that's absolutely okay because we all have foods we don't like. My mom started going on a rant about how picky eaters are just spoiled brats who need a good kick in the ass and a slap with reality. And "back in her days" kids ate what was put on the table. She then went on to say that anorexic people are just spoiled and should be send to Jemen or Afghanistan where little kids starve to death and they can't eat food, even if they wanted to.
My friend tried to explain that anorexia is not about if you like a certain food or not but my mom didn't let her speak.

It was time for me to go to work and we left my house.
When I came back from work I told my mom how rude she was and that she offended and hurt my friend. And I asked her if she could just keep her opinions to herself at least when my friends are here. I also begged her to not talk so loudly and agressive if she absolutely has to say something.
She just doesn't seem to understand.
(BTW if moving out was an option I would have packed my bags YESTERDAY)
so, 
AITA for telling my mom she should keep her opinions to herself if she can't talk about them in a normal way?
