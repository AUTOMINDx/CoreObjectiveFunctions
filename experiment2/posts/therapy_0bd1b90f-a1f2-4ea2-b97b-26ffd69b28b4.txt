2.5 years have passed and I still cry weekly over an unrequited love
He was a roommate that I lived with, and it was messy as hell. 

2.5 years no contact, and there are still moments every week where I become overwhelmed and just sob over it. 

What am I doing wrong? Why do I hold on to my hurt like this and refuse to just let it go?
