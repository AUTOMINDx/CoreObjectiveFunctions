AITA for telling my "son" I am not your father?
So at a music festival when I was 17 (now 36) I had drunken sex with Júlia (41F). Than I haven't heard from her for about 16 years we are different parts of our country.

But it turns out she got pregnant with my son (Ádám 17M) and she met on that same festival her husband and the actual father of my son (József 44M).  So because of the pregnancy they hastily got married despite that Júlia was honest and told József about the possibility that he isn't the father.

The reason why I know about this is because 2 yeas ago  they took a DNA ancestry test a the same one  as I took not long before them.  Then I popped up for them as the bio father of Ádám. That was a traumatic experience for them and  also for me my wife was really angry that I might  cheated till she haven't found out how old Ádám was I had to sleep on the sofa (latter she apologized). 

So because I wanted to know Ádám and he wanted know me what went okayish. But it turned out József  and I like the same nerd shit so we became quite good friends.

Now then the incident. So since I came into the picture Ádám started to act disrespectful toward his father.  So me with my family spent the weekend at their house. Where József and Ádám had a quite loud argument this morning what ended with Ádám shouting "You are not even my real dad". That's  when I blew up and shouted something like this (it wasn't in English) "Listen here you little shit. How dare you talk this way to your father. Because he is your father he raised and unconditionally loves you.  The thing that I am your sperm donor means nothing. I am not your father and never will be."

It was a mess so we left earlier than intended.

So reddit AITA?
