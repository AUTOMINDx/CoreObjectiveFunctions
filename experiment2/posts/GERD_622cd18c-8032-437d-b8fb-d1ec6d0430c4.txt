Hyper aware of my pulse.
I was for 6 months on pantoprazole 40mg per day, finally i stopped it, with good results regarding the overall burning and dyspepsia.I can eat pretty much normally and i have very small burning on bad days only. But what changed, is that after stopping it, im hyper aware of my pulse and another pulsating feelings in my chest-belly.

Its not tachycardia for sure, im on heart rate reducing medication for anxiety(inderal) and most of the times i have 80ish-90ish pulse when i walk slowly, but yet i can feel my pulse vibrating in my chests. For most people it would be much of an issue, but having anxiety makes this really uncomfortable and annoying, could it be gerd related? does anyone having similar symptoms, happy to read your answers.
