Am I doing this wrong?
Sorry if this isn’t the best place to put this. But I’ve really been needing to ask this.

Basically I feel like my therapy is pointless because it’s just me rambling most of the time. And it’s not even the type that saying it out loud makes you see it differently. And even my therapist tells me I seem to know how and what I feel, what my boundaries are etc. idk why but this upsets me. It’s kinda like how I was told as a child I’m smart so now have grown to become frustrated with myself when I’m not instantly good at something. It just feels like I’m saying problems to someone and they offer little in way of a different prospective. And she isn’t the first! The past three have been like this all telling me the same shit. Which is why I think I’m misunderstanding or having unrealistic expectations of what I should be achieving with this. Is this the case? Perhaps tell me what to do differently? Again sorry if this doesn’t belong here or is just a ramble.
