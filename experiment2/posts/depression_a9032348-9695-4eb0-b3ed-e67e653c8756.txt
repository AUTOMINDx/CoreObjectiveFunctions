I failed
I’m a complete failure. I’ve let everyone down. My depressive ramblings have pushed people away. All I do is just lay in bed all day and burden those around me. And I’m just so stupid I can’t do well at anything. I tried so hard and still get bad grades. I hate being stupid, I hate being me, no one likes me.
