I just want to vent
I just recently got a job at a Tobacco &amp; Lottery store, I had been off work for over a year and was living off my saving at my last job where I worked at a disabled person care company ( like I showed up to their homes and spent 12 hours then went back home) so this is my first job that’s out of my comfort zone. It’s so foreign. So terrifying. I haven’t had a panic attack there yet but I cry when I get home every time. I don’t want to show up but I need this job to pay bills. I hate dealing with the public, it’s not just some chill tobacco store like it’s constantly busy and there’s a drive thru, I have to show my face to hundreds of people which makes me cringe inside. I know I come off so awkward and weird to customers and even to my coworkers training me, I don’t know what to do to improve. I have isolated myself for close to 5 years, this is all so scary to me. The isolation made it hard to join society again.
