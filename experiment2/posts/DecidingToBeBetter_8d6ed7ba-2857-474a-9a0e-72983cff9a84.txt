Trying to regulate my gaming
So far, I spend way too much time playing this game called mobile legends. I am naturally competitive and I want to reach to the top of the leaderboards of the game. However, everytime I lose a game or win, I always want to play more to either keep the run going or to turn things around. However, I end up spending way to much time in this chase. So, during the last few months I tried to remove myself from the game. However, there was an increase in my competitive energy in other parts of my life and ended up feeling very depressed over even small things. I also started to compare myself with others which is not a good things. After all, our lives are very complicated and it is not like I am a complete failure. I have personal studies and projects going on where I excel everytime I invest some time. So, I realized that this game was quite helpful to keep myself from being overly competitive. It is like a necessary evil for me. 

As a result I am planning to regulate the use of the game. I will play this game only as a reward for having a good day where I have worked well in my other goals. Where I am tried and want to freshen myself. I will limit the amount of the game I play for no more then 1 or 2 hours at the night. Before going to sleep. 

I am deciding to bring balance into my life. I am way too intense in everything I do. I want to learn how can I tame myself and become more rounded in all aspects of my life. I am sure this will be a good start to other things to follow.
