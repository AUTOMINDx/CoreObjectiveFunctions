Intensive Outpatient
Has anyone done an intensive outpatient program for their agoraphobia? I’ve been doing CBT/exposure therapy with a regular therapist for about a year without too much improvement. I’m considering one of these programs where you would go like 20-30 hours a week and includes several hours of exposure. Im just nervous to spend the money.
