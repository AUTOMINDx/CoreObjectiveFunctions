Ok , so I'm a guy and I've become friends with a woman at the gym we go to.
We've been friends for a couple of months and i asked her out last week. She said she'd love to , but has a tone of work. Is that genuine and should I ask again some other time or is that a hint for me to leave her alone and just stay friends?
