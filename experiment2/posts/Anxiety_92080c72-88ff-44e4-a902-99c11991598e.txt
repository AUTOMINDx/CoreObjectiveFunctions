Sick of this health anxiety
I'm so sick of the health anxiety, and the way the doctors offices talk/look at me bc I can't seem to stop calling them. I understand I have anxiety but no one gets it. No one gers how scary it is. It's so fucking scary to think something is wrong constantly. The only solace I get is hearing a dr tell me I'm okay. But I feel so stupid and everyone makes me feel so stupid. This is horrible.
