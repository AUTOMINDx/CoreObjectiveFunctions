How the hell do you flirt?
27F here. I’m not sure how to flirt especially with someone I’m genuinely interested in. I’ve dated a bit but never felt truly attracted to any guy… also, I have never been in a relationship, so I’m at a lost.

There’s a guy I would really like to get know but the thought of running into him gives me anxiety; my first instinct is to runaway because I’m scared of saying the wrong thing or coming off too strong.

How can I get over this fear and how can I flirt to show that I’m interested in him? I’m pretty positive he’s attracted to me as well. Any tips or advice would be appreciated.

Should I compliment him? For example, letting him know he has beautiful eyes. I feel like my brain short circuits when I’m around him so maintaining a conversation with him is work - even though he initiates  the majority of conversations. I don’t want him to think I’m uninterested.
