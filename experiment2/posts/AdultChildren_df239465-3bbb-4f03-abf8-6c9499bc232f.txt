My dad drove home drunk last night
I’m the 24 yo eldest daughter of a 6 person household. I’m living at home and saving up for my own house (hopefully out soon god help me). My dads drinking has gotten progressively worse over the last 2 years. He and my mom almost broke off their engagement 25 years ago when he got a DUI- he didn’t drink too much when we were kids because he didn’t have time. Now that we’re older, he has more freedom and it’s become an unavoidable problem. My dad is a narcissist who suffered a lot of trauma himself, so in some ways I do feel bad for him. 

Last night he went to a reunion with friends from highschool. My mom won’t go out with him anymore because he embarrasses her. He didn’t come home until 4 am, parked the car on the curb, and verbally abused my mom for 2hrs in bed when he woke her up and she asked him to be quiet. He lost his cell phone and woke up this morning acting like nothing happened. My mom is talking about divorce, but knows she can’t leave him because she’s financially dependent. 

He’s a hypocrite. My entire life he told me if he ever found out I drank and drove he’s murder me. I’ve been punished time and time again because he SUSPECTED I drank and decided to drive home. I would never. He could have killed someone he was so drunk. So now, he will sulk all day and apologize probably once and make us feel bad for him for us being mad at him. 

I want so badly to wash my hands of this but my mom is stuck with him (plus I live here and always feel like I need to do all of the emotional labor to save my younger siblings the trouble). This is the 6th time this year he has done something that could have killed him, severely publicly embarrassed the family, and become downright nasty. He went to therapy a few times then started no showing appointments &amp; now we owe them money. I feel bad for giving up on him but I’m tired of this happening over and over again with the same outcome.
