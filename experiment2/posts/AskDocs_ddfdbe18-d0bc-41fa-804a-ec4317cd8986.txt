Why do I get these painful, pus filled boils on my labia every so often? (See pic below)
Background on me and the issue: 
28F, 5’10, 268lb, white, issues with boils on my labia for years with a current flare up. 

not a tobacco user, daily marijuana user, social alcohol drinker. I exercise an average of 3 days weekly (weight lifting). I have PCOS and celiac disease, as well as bipolar type 1 and PTSD. Medications are Latuda 40mg and lamotrigene 50mg taken at night. Boils have been an issue my entire life, this particular one formed a day or two ago. The worst instance of cysts / boils have been pilonidal disease that lead to pilonidal cleft surgery (2018) and PCOS that lead to ovarian cyst removals on both sides (laparoscopic, 2015). I do not have facial or bodily acne/skin irregularities otherwise. 

Of note….I have never been one to wear underwear and often now have these boils occur as a result of wearing underwear when I choose to. 

These boils are very painful and sometimes span my entire labia in one hard mass. Usually after a length of time ranging from 1-3 weeks, a head forms that I can force to pop and drain. It’s a yellowish brownish pus and blood mixture until it pushes out just blood, then heals over to form again. 

How do I prevent these? Why do they happen? They aren’t in line with when I shave or exfoliate, it seems. I hadn’t shaved in over a month when the last one formed. It was the length of my labia and lasted close to a month before popping when it was finally too painful to sit down.

ETA: I’m aware my weight plays a significant role and am [working on it!](https://ibb.co/87kGQ51) I was 415lb at my highest a few years back, and have done a lot to combat that detrimental lifestyle
