Where is the correct, middle line between nice guy syndrome and creepy?
I'm not in the dating game yet, but i need to clear up a big confusion of mine before I try:
I browse r/niceguys alot to see how NOT to behave, and that has helped. But it confuses me. Because a lot of men don't know how to flirt and the only thing they can do is be nice. However obviously women arent obligated to accept that niceness as a date request. But surely just acting very flirtatious and asking out quickly is a bad idea also? How are you meant to behave when you want to engage in a relationship with someone without just being nice?
