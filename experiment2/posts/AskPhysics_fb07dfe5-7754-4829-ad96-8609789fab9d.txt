Capacitors in equilibrium
Hi everyone!
I need some help with the question b) of a problem involving RC circuits:

There's a circuit like this (I hope the drawing isn't too fucked up):

         _____√\√\√\_________
         |                  |
        ___                ___
        ___                ___
         |                  |
         _____________________
Description: the circuit is a simple square. On the vertical sides there's 2 capacitors, C1 and C2, on the top side there's a resistance R, while the bottom side is short-circuited.

Where C1, C2 and R are given.
At Time=0 C1 is fully charged with Q=Q0, while C2 is fully discharged.

a) describe the situation at equilibrium
b) at what time T1 is such equilibrium reached?


a) 
Equilibrium =&gt; no current =&gt; ∆V1=∆V2
Also we know that (charges on capacitor 1 at start) = (charges on capacitor 1 and 2 at equilibrium) Q0=Q1+Q2 

It's an easy system in 2 equations and 2 variables.
Once solved we'll have Q1, Q2 and ∆V


b) how do I do this?
I was thinking about using the formula for the discharge of the first capacitor Q1(t)=Q0*e^(-t/RC) but it doesn't work as there's a couple numeric problems in my book, and I'm not getting the correct results.
Moreover since the system is in equilibrium, situation at T1 should be equal to situation at TInfinity.
If so, i want   Q1= Lim(Q1(t)) t--&gt;+infinity, but using the discharge formula such Lim=0
