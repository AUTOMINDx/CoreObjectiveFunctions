Why do I still count with my fingers as an adult?
9+3 = ? Couldn't tell you.

7+8 = ? Couldn't tell you.

9 - 6 = You get the picture. As long as I can't use my hands, it's literally a mental struggle for me to add, subtract, &amp; so on. I was taught how to count at the right age like everyone else—*especially* multiplication, but ever since around 10 or 11, I slowly started to watch all the kids around me able to blurt out answers to simple math problems faster and faster while I stayed stuck with finger counting. Numbers with tens digits or more adding/subtracting together? Forget it, I'm writing it somewhere to solve that. Even air-drawing couldn't save me. At 13 or 14, so freshman year of h.s., there'd be geometry problems with finding area, volume, or algebra which has its fair share of the big 4 (+–x÷).

During timed tests on subjects like \^this\^, I'd see kids finish or put their heads down 15, 20 minutes after the tests were passed out. After 30–40 minutes, I remember my math teacher walking by my desk all, "I have to start the lesson soon, let's go". \[Turned in incomplete, as always.\] I blamed my stupid brain, unable to do the side-work without whispering and throwing up gang signs to myself.

Nothing's different now of course. I never talked about it with anyone, it should be second nature. But I can't do it and it's frustrating as hell.
