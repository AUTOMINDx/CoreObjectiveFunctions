P.E. after name after passing exam
How soon do y’all put the P.E. behind your name on your email signature after receiving the notification you passed the PE exam? Also, if you live on the boarder between multiple jurisdictions do you put in quotations (#state you passed your PE) below your name or just say fuck it a PE is a PE?

This will probably jinx me before NCEES releases their results so then I’m only asking for a friend.
