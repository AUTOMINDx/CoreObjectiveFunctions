Life Rut…
Graduated college a little later with my degree in Human Performance. I’m 27. I have been working a government job as a Youth Athletics Coordinator for about 1.5 years now. Pay is decent (for florida), benefits are excellent (I pay legit $5 a week for health, vision and dental). The hours STINK. I understood what I was getting into, having to work every Saturday for 8 weeks during certain sport seasons, late nights multiple times a week during others. Commute isn’t terrible but on the way home can take upwards of an hour. It has taken its toll on me. 

I need a new job. I have always looked at firefighting, however that would require me to quit my job, go to EMT school then the Academy. Which at this point in my life I don’t know if I can go 6-8 months without an income and having to pay rent, student loans, ect. Would also love a remote job but I have no background in IT or software. So I’m in a rut and don’t know what to do. We’re also moving states in probably 10 months or so. Thanks for listening to my rant. Lol
