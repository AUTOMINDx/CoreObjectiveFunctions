Where do I fit in?
Hello Reddit! I am a 25 year old male in MN, USA. Some college experience, no degree and former college athlete. About 2 years of sales experience and about 6 years experience in front of house management for restaurants. The sales I have been in were direct sales for residential construction and indirect logistics sales. The time I've done them both I was decently proficient, just not exactly a great fit for me... I'm here really to seek guidance. What kind of sales would I actually be fit for with this type of background? Am I even fit for it? As far as the kind of job I'm looking for, I just want something that pays decent. I'm not exactly looking to make a million dollars right now, because well, as far as I can tell I'm not qualified. I'd like to take home $52k + with salary/commission combined.
