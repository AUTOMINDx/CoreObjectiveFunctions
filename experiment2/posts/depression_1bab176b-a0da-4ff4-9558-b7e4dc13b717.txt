What does everyone do when they’re extremely depressed?
I’m 23 and just recently accepted that my asian parents are emotionally abusing me and now i am extremely depressed. I am not coping and i want to end it all. My only source of happiness is my boyfriend and i dont want to burden him. I work as a nurse so i am extremely busy and dont get to see him much. How does everyone cope?
