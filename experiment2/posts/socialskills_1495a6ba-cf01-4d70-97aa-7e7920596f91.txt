My best friend and I have known each other for decades now but I fear it’s going downhill. Any advice?
As children, teenagers, and even college kids, I’ve found my relationship with my best friend pretty easy — but over the past year or so I find myself exhausted whenever we hang out.

I have a small handful of close friends and consider myself pretty introverted whereas she has a huge social circle with plans every weekend. Still, she likes keeping me close and even wants us to share an apartment together. We definitely care about each other but I’ve noticed that most of our conversations revolve around her. Granted, her love life, career, and friends have more going on than mine, but I would love if she paid a little more attention to who I am without her.

We hung out today and I was under the impression that because it was my birthday this week, the conversation might be different. It wasn’t. I can get her attention with “pointless” stuff like the Netflix shows I’m watching but she’s never interested in expanding on the things that carry more “weight” — like how I recently got laid off or how I spent my birthday. At one point she made a quip about how she feels like the “main character”, which only confirms my fears in being a background character in her life.

I don’t know what I can do. I don’t want to get mad at her or start a fight. The only way I’ve ever dealt with this is creating distance between us but despite strong arming me, she’s still very sensitive and “taking breaks” hurts her feelings.
