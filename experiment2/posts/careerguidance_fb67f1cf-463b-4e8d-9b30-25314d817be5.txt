Working in home country or overseas?
Hi y'all!

As a context: I am (23) currently in my final sem of my masters degree and ofcourse now i have to start looking for a job. Unfortunately i only have an internship and some volunteer works previously which means i don't have a good working experiences. I did both undergraduate and postgrad studies overseas and I've always wanted to find job overseas rather than in home country.

So based on the context above, do you think it's more rational and wiser to work in home country or overseas? Or home country first then overseas? Or straight overseas? Enlighten me.
