Weekly Answer Round Up: Quality and Overlooked Answers From the Last Week - November 28, 2021
We're going to ~~shamelessly steal~~ adapt from /r/AskHistorians the idea of a weekly thread to gather and recognize the good answers posted on the sub.  Good answers take time to type and the mods can be slow to approve things which means that sometimes good content doesn't get seen by as many people as it should.  This thread is meant to  fix that gap. 

Post answers that you enjoyed, felt were particularly high quality, or just didn't get the attention they deserved.  This is a weekly recurring thread posted every Sunday morning.
