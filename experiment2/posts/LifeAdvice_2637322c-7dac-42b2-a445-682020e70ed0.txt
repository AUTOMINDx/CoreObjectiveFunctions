Don't know what I can do with my love for culture
I love culture. I love seeing the difference between all the different people around the world but also the similarities (for instance how food in places vastly different like Italy and Japan are these massive draws to bring people together.) My dilemma is that I don't know what to do with it. I wish I could study world culture and make a living out of it, But as far as I know I can't. And even if I could my current job pays really well and it's hard to give that up when the former comes into play. So yeah, any advice from Reddit?
