Need to get my refill
And here we go. I can go out back and play, go to the store via car, go to my moms, but the THOUGHT of walking three minutes from my apartment to get my meds from the pharmacy is killing me. I'm tired of making my boyfriend pick them up for me every single month. Why does walking give me so much fckn anxiety?!?!?!?
