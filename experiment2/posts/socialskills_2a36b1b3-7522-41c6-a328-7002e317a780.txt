How to put in more effort in conversations?
How does one go about putting in more effort when making conversations? Being less akward.

I noticed that in most gatherings lately i usually just agree or nod and don’t really express myself bcus most of the time i’d like to think i’m just being easy going and chill. But it’s becoming an issue to the point where me and my bf would come back home after a night out with friends and would point out that i’m socially awkward or if i’m being too quiet and dont really talk to people whereas he is the opposite. My usual defense is that i’m a reserved person, soft spoken, introverted and a virgo rising. But he thinks i shouldn’t be proud of saying that bcus people can change and put more effort if they cared enough. 

I feel like i’m not the same as i was in highschl where i felt like i was more extroverted and always wanting to be out about and seen. Nowadays, i want deeper connections. I havent had the best of luck on terms of friendship and having reliable girlfriends. I dont really have interesting things to say, and sometimes i just blank out in social gatherings. Idk. Any advice?
