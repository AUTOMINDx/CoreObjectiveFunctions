Today is just one of those curveballs (vent)
I went to a Friendsgiving yesterday with my girlfriend and talked a many things on the drive towards our destination.  On the way back, things took a turn when she asked me if I really wanted to travel the world and live in a van.  She’s been dreaming about this for a while now and was disappointed to find that I just wasn’t as thrilled about this idea like she was.  I would still want to live in a van, but when I tell her yes she believes that I’m pushing away my dreams for hers.  I told her that at the moment I didn’t have any concrete hopes and dreams at the moment, which is a worrisome thing to say and paints me as someone with no drive or ambition.  I’ve been working full time at Target doing 8 hour shifts and trying to juggle my relationship and my internal struggle.  My girlfriend is supportive and wants the best for me, while internally I feel stuck in a cycle of self loathing.  I ended up crying last night and this morning as a response to all this and now I’m at work with this ambiguity, the lack of security in anything really.  Everything just feels off today, and I’m just trying my best to keep going, not knowing what to expect from the future.
