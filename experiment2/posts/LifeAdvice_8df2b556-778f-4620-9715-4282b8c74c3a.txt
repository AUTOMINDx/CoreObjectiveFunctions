Switching schools senior year
Hi . First of all I do not live in the US but in Europe .
I’m currently in my last year of high school. I got diagnosed with Trigeminal neuralgia aka the suicide disease at the end of September. Ever since I haven’t been able to go to school. I got all the notes from my classmate and I’ve been studying it all by myself. However my class teacher suggested that I email other teachers explaining my situation and ask if I could take my exams and assignments online. All teachers said no saying that it wouldn’t be fair to other students and that they just don’t want to send the exams . they said they would send it only if schools are closed again due to lockdown. I was a little surprised to hear this after two years of only online studying and the fact that some schools in my country offer online school due to bad covid situation.  My class teacher basically said if I don’t have enough grades by the end of January I would have to go through senior year again. Again with no support regarding my illness. 
There are two options. I could still hope that schools get closed again due to lockdown or I would have to retake my senior year again in September AGAIN with zero support from school.
Ever since the call with my class teacher I’ve been thinking of dropping my current high school. The teachers have been rude to me and kids have been bullying me for about three years. So no I don’t enjoy or like that school one bit. My parents forced me to go there . I’ve been thinking of dropping this high school if they make me retake this last year. I found a school where I could study online for two years and then get my diploma . Cons are that I would have to stay two more years at high school before moving on to college . 
Any advice ? Thank you
