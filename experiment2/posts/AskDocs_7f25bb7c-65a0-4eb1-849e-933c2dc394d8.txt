Possible infection + nerve damage
I’m female, I turn 15 in one month. These are self inflicted (i’m currently getting therapy and help). The only medication i take is lexapro. However I have been taking pain medication (over the counter ibuprofen) lately for the possible nerve damage. In both of these pictures I was able to see fascia when the wound was first inflicted but I didn’t pierce through it. It’s been roughly a week since I did them and I’m worried they are infected. I had never gone this deep so I’m not familiar with how these should look whole healing. I’m also wondering if I should consult a doctor for the nerve damage I think I have caused. There’s pain in my hand when I do certain movements or apply pressure. Sometimes there’s a tingling sensation in my hand, and my forearm is numb to the touch. There are many other healing cuts though, but they don’t spark concern like the ones in the images i’m attached. Hoping to get answers on how I should go about this.
