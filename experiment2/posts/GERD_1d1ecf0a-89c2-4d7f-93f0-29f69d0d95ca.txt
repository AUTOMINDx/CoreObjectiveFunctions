Can manometry test substitute for barium swallow test?
[35F] I have LPR (symptoms are shortness of breath and globus) that is not responding to medication. The doctor will likely order one of these tests. I prefer to not get the barium swallow test because I got a lot of imaging done in the pastâ€”would the manometry test on its own suffice?
