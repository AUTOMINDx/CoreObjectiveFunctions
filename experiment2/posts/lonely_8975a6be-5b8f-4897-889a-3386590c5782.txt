I’m harder to forget than I was to leave……I bet you think about me.
Why fall in love just so you can watch it go away? I’ll spend the rest of my life wondering if you knew how I really felt about you. That I would have blocked everything out for you. Now you’ll here voices saying “why did you let her go?”. Does it make you feel sad that the love that you’re looking for is the love that you had? Crisp autumn mornings with crunchy leaf walks. Our dogs getting way too excited to jump into the piles of leaves that line our favorite trail. Our babies running too far ahead with their shiny long hair bouncing. None of us match. We’re all in whatever flannel happened to be clean. Everything is orange, red and yellow. One of our babies runs up to us to show us the biggest leaf they’ve ever seen. You’d think to yourself “how did I get her? What did I do that made her pick me?”. I’d stop and look up at you with the sun lighting up my face and say “I’ve been waiting for you my entire life”……..I’ll wait forever.
