swollen lymph nodes and extreme fatigue
I'm 16F and i'm from Italy. I'm white, 153 cm tall and i weigh 41 kgs. In late september/begninning of october i started developing extreme fatigue, to the point where i could barely do a thing. During the first week of october i went to a doctor, who prescribed me blood work. The results came back saying i was really anemic and my doctor prescribed me iron supplements. The iron supplements gave me extremely awful stomach aches and worse of all, they did not relieve my fatigue. At ALL. So we cut off the iron supplements, and i noticed a few more things going south. I checked in with my doctor again, and I have swollen lymph nodes in the groin. I've recently noticed my neck lymph nodes are swollen too. I also have been recently experiencing bad night sweats and sometimes i get itchy, but that might be because i have sensitive skin. I've been often getting a low fever that comes at night and disappears in the morning. I also have a patch of what i think is acne on my face, but it hasn't gone away in a month? Idk if its related. I also noticed i lost a few kgs (I used to weigh 45 kgs at the beginning of September) I currently am not on medications and my doctor prescribed additional blood tests to do. Does anyone have any sort of idea of what might me going on?
