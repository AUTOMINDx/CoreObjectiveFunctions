What should I do next with my career?
Hello Reddit,
Hope everyoneâ€™s doing great. I needed some advise on how I should advance with my career. I am already doing a drop shipping business and it has worked pretty well for me. Been doing it from last 5 years and it has helped me a lot. I also got a CIS degree which is computer information system mix of IT and business.
Coming to my question, I am thinking of starting something related to IT or tech. The next 20-30 years looks like an era of massive digital boom and tech and AI. 
So what you guys think I should start which will be a good business in IT in the coming years. Not really interested in the crypto or NFT space. My current business is good but it is at the saturation stage. I need something I can sell for years to come. Would prefer something more in the service sector!
