PhD application question
Hi

After working for 13 years in my field, I have decided to apply to do my PhD in Social Work. I am trying to figure out what to submit for my writing sample. I can't find any papers from my master's degree, and my current work doesn't allow for the type of writing I need.

Any suggestions???
