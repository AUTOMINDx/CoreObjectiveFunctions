ADHD, C-PTSD, or both?
Has anyone who’s been diagnosed with ADHD been diagnosed later on with C-PTSD or vice versa? The symptoms seem so similar and it’s hard to figure out which one I actually have (and yes I’ve been professionally diagnosed with both, but that doesn’t mean mistakes can’t be made). Just curious.
