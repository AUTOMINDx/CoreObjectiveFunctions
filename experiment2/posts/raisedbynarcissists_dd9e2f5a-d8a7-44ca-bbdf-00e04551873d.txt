My 78yo mother needed to be confronted. So, after confronting her orally, I confronted her in writing. Here’s what I said in my letter.
Dear Mum,

Thank you for dinner.

I have spent over 30 years defending your bad behavior because I honestly thought you didn’t realize how toxic you are. Well, I was wrong. You know. You just don’t care.

You are a bully and a narcissist. We won’t get along until you get some help. 

If it makes you feel better, please continue to blame my mental illness. That’s exactly what a narcissist would do, after all. Alternatively, look up Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I still love you, but I’m tired of your refusal to live in the real world. Keep this up, and you’ll lose not only me but also your grandchild.

Please send Dad my warmest regards.

I’ll see you both tomorrow.

Love, _____.
