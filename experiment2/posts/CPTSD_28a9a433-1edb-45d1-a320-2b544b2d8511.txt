Old letters from an emotionally abusive friendship
I had an emotionally abusive friendship for 10 years and I tend to minimize the impact this had because I don’t see many people talk about trauma that comes from friendships. I tend to also think that people will just say it was a bad friendship and now that person is well liked and has more friends than I do. But recently I was looking at letters they wrote me while we were friends and all of the letters mentioned that they knew I didn’t trust them and that the were sorry for being a bad friend and wanted to fix their behavior. When I read letters from other friends during the time none of them say that, they’re just typical letters. I have a lot of mixed feelings, I feel validated that I know I’m not crazy and it was a messed up friendship, but in those letters they also tell me how much they love me and how I’m a great friend. These letters are also from when we were kids and sometimes I think I should let it go because they were a kid, but I’m still angry about all the trauma it caused me.
