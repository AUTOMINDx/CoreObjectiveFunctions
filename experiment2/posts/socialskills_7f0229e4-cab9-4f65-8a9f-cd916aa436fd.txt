Is it okay to not invite so to a kinda home party if I feel awkward around him?
There is this guy in my group of friends that's nice and polite and so on. But everytime he is with us, I feel a little bit awkward around him. I can't describe it but he has a subtle weirdness to himâ€”like when a guy tries to sneakingly checkout your body at every possibility.

Us friendos will have a little get-together this weekend at my home. For personal reasons in the past I'm already anxious about letting people into my home. But I try to overcome this anxiety and they are well-known friends to me anyway. So what better conditions could I wish for a step of bravery.

Now guy mentioned above asked if he could come, too. And I'm torn because I don't want to make him feel excluded but I also don't want to feel weird and invaded in my own home.

What should I do?
