Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong…
At least that’s how Murphy would say it. It seems like over the past year everything has gone so wrong. My grandfather is bound to pass away soon, my love interests either only want me for my body or I don’t have anything in common with them, got a shit box that is constantly screaming in pain every time I engage the ignition (I don’t know if I’ll be able to drive for much longer), company I work for barely cares about me, I’m left alone with a mean room mate and all my family is on the other side of the country. I’ve got friends sure… but they don’t help me the way I need right now. I don’t know what I’m doing anymore things feel numb. Smoking doesn’t seem to calm me down anymore and all I feel is rejection and abandonment. Why the fuck can’t something just go right…?
