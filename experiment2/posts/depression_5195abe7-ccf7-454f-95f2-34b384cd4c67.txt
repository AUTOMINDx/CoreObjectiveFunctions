Depression feels like you're not the main character of your own life
You feel as if you aren't In control of what you want in life , it feels hopeless . You feel like you exist for the sake of existing without having a purpose, you're afraid of getting yourself out there because you failed once and you will fail again . Youve been hurt to the point where youre heart is hard as a rock and cold as the winter days, and find it hard to love again . You don't feel that you're important , you can't love yourself it feels impossible . You feel everyone hates you , nothing goes your way you give your all to everyone because that's how you are . 

That's how I feel mostly idk about anyone else . Let me know how it feels for you , I'll be there for you ♥️
