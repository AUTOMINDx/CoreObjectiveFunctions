Why are rechargeable batteries so far behind?
Can someone please explain why batteries lag behind current tech? It’s gotten to the point where I prefer to use anything wired rather than batteries. They are a pain to charge and I have so many appliances that use them. What’s worse is that they degrade at a faster rate than a non-stick frying pan.
