Does anyone else have intense paranoia from CPTSD? I started taking medication for this recently and am wondering if I’m alone
I’ve been estranged from my family for 4 years, after a childhood full of sexual abuse and incest. I was an escort from 17-24 and have experienced some intense shit that led to a regular PTSD diagnosis, and I used to have really intense periods of paranoia when I first got housing after homelessness (things like sleepwalking &amp; moving furniture in front of my door to keep people out, carrying weapons, refusing to speak to anyone). 

It’s gotten better since then, but now the only paranoia I have is that every person I interact with - at the grocery store, on the metro, and even my closest friend - are all somehow working for/in contact with my abusive family. I’ve been clean off hard drugs and psychiatric medication for 4 years until this month when I started seeing a psychiatrist because the paranoia is seriously impacting my ability to make or keep friends. 

Has anyone else experienced this? So far the medication (Seroquel) is helping a small amount but it’s not completely gone.

Edit: just to explain a little of where this paranoia is coming from. When I was 22, I was in the worst and most dangerous part of my escorting career, on drugs, and my life was just falling apart. An extended family member took me in, promised over and over that they understood my parents were abusive and they were there to help. That family member sexually assaulted me and I became homeless again after. Since that happened I have zero ability to trust people and I’m constantly trying to convince myself that people aren’t conspiring against me.
