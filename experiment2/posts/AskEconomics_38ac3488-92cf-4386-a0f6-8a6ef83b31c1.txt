How accurate is this statement "in unregulated markets monoplies naturally always emerge"
I came across this opinion once but I don't have enough knowledge about economics to assess its validity. I think the person used the drug trade as an example with cartels becoming monoplies. I guess I just want to understand how legit this opinion is and resources to look into it further.
