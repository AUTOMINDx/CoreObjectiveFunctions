Can devices be made that could turn volcanoes into foundries?
I imagine some sort of platform like a drilling rig made out of carbon nano tubes and suspended, rather than planted, by propellers powered by geothermal energy gotten from batteries, would be needed in order to move equipment in and out. Maybe a blimp with it carbon fiber, NASA space shuttle underbelly might be the trick.
