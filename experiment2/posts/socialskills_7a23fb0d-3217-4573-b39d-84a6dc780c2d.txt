How to ask about hobbies/interests without sounding like an interview?
I’ve always wondered if there’s a good way to ask people what their hobbies or interests are without sounding like i’m interrogating them. “What do you like to do in your free time?” “what are you into?” “what are your hobbies?” all just sound like interview questions, and i’d like a better way to phrase/ask it. Thanks!
