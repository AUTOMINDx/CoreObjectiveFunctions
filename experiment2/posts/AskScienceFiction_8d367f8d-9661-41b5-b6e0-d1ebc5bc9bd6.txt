[Harry Potter] - why go through all of the theatrics of hiding the Philosopher’s Stone, they way they did, and not using more practical and effective magic?
Obviously, Dumbledore went through a lot of trouble planning a task for multiple layers of getting to the stone.  Wouldn’t it have been more effective hiding the stone in a location with more effective magic, similar to what was done to hide Grimwult Place?


I mean; here you have a Cerebus, who goes down with a flute…. a plant that first years are taught how to beat.. a key that’s out in open, you just have to catch it.. a wizard chess board. A troll and some potions and the Mirror


Obviously none of that was enough… especially considering a couple of first years breezed right through the tasks.


So why not hide the stone in a trunk similar to what Moody used? Or hidden in a trunk, hidden in a space like Grimwult Place?  Or any number of other pocket dimension places that a wizard as powerful as Dumbledore can create?
