What is the pro argument for wearing shoes inside the house?
As someone that doesn't wear shoes inside im just curious what is the pro argument for not taking off my shoes when I enter the house.

Edit: if your argument is that taking the shoes off and putting them back on is annoying/feels like a chore, please provide an explanation for how a 25 seconds process is annoying
