Anybody else dreading the next month of holidays?
I (26M) moved 8 hours away from my Nmom. Best decision ever. She inevitably came to visit for Thanksgiving for 8 days. I am so drained mentally after the constant little comments, constant little demands (just come here real quick and get me some water, and then proceeds to not even drink the water) and constant requests for praise (isn’t that shirt I got you 8 years ago such high class? As she goes through my closet). I’m supposed to go home for 8 days for Christmas and I just can’t. I’m already so scared and drained. I want to bail so bad or come up with an excuse to not go home. Can anybody relate?
