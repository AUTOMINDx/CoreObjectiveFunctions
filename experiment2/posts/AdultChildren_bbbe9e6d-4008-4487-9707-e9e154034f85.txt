Trouble forgiving
Hey Reddit,

My dad has made enormous strides from where he once was.

 At his worst he was doing 3 bottles of red wine a night and acting like a proper proper cunt. There were times when he was aggressive and threatened my mum, my sister and I. I distinctly remember one time when my mum locked him out and he pushed her through an open window, whereupon she fell onto a coffee table snapping it's legs. It was rough, growing up in that environment where you don't know what man, what version of himself was gonna turn up ; Was it the lovable guy who loved his family, or was it this dark figure that was making and aggressive?


5 years on from what was essentially a divorce (my parents where never married but we're together for 16 years) and he has undoubtedly improved himself. He's lost a tonne of weight, swims regularly in the morning, is making good money doing remote architecture and has become an overall nicer guy who drinks much less.

There's one thing, however - I  can't forgive him. He was so instrumental in my pain and torment growing up and now he's ok he just expects me to be fine, being all pally pally. This is so hard to articulate but I really feel this fucking anguish. He has hurt me so much and tore my family apart. Every time he speaks to me I feel this burning and annoyance to anything he says. 

Again, I'm really struggling to find the words to describe this feeling, but all I  need help with is finding forgiveness and a path to reconcilation with my dad.
