WIBTA for not providing meat to my meat-eater friends even though I'm vegetarian?
So my bf and I are vegetarian, and I plan on hosting a new year's eve party at my house for all my friends and him. My friends know very well that I throw on a lot of food whenever I host get-togethers. But thing is though, all the food I provide is vegetarian. I am not comfortable with buying meat, I tried once to buy sausages but second-guessed because I knew I would feel guilty.

I said I would be buying vegetarian meat stuff, but one of my friends thinks that as a host I should be providing meat to meat-eaters, otherwise I'm just forcing my beliefs onto others, that I should be 'accomodating to other people's cuisines'. I'd never let my friends starve, but I feel bad telling them to bring their own meat. I'm really not buying meat, but I worry that some friends may be put off from coming because of it. Am I really a bad host for not buying meat for meat-eaters?

WIBTA?

EDIT: Thankyou so much everyone for your responses! I came to the general consensus that I'm not the asshole so long as I let people know the deal. Told my friend and he calls me a shit host. But I'm not the asshole so that's alriiiiiiight

EDIT2: Can't believe how much attention this picked up, but it's great! I'm so happy to see people supportive of this and not make me out to be a freak. But I have taken people's advice into consideration, I will be notifying people that no meat will be here but that gourmet veggie food will be. I have also asked for advice on what they would like to see there that is vegetarian. Said friend said that he would be happy if there was potato and sour cream with cranberry sauce. I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean, but I'm definitely keeping this post in my bookmarks to show future assholes.
