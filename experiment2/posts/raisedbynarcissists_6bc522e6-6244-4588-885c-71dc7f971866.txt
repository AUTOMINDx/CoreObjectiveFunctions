Oh WOW! I'm 57 and I just found out this weekend that being Raised by Narcissists is a thing.
I just joined reddit and this is my first post. Someone dear to me told me about this sub and thought it fit what I had described as my experience growing up. I will try my best to use the correct terminology here, but it is very new to me.

I thought my family was just dysfunctional. I thought most families were dysfunctional.  I thought most everybody I have ever met was dysfunctional.  I am constantly on high alert for people trying to manipulate me because they usually do try.  I attract those type of people.

With the recent help of a therapist I have been processing through the thoughts that my mom was just a mean mom - kind of the mean-girl/queen-bee of all she surveyed. Not every mother is loving it turns out. Prior to this sub I could never understand why my nmom would very rarely acknowledge that I have done some good stuff in my life and just heaped on criticism and cruelty.  My dad lives on constantly swaying pendulum between caring, enabling my mom, gleeful revenge a\*\*hole, and flying monkey. My sister who is eleven months younger than me was horribly treated as a scapegoat, but they need her now that they are older and she has become the worst narc of them all. I am NC with that sister, LC with parents. Also, I have learned that I have some fleas that I was unaware of that I will need to apologize for - specifically downplaying other people's pain and also that, years ago, I was a flying monkey to my littlest sister.

Now I am reading through your posts and responses and... well my mind is blown! So many of your experiences resonate with mine.  This is a lot!  I am so glad I found you!
