Feels confused by the new guy im seeing (F,29) (M, 35) dk how to progress
I (F, 29) dont know how to feel about this. Seeing a guy (M, 35) for 2 months, initially he started confessing about feeling attached to me and likes me. Been meeting twice a week and he shares very intimate details about his life and therapy stuff..we do bf/gf things until suddenly this topic came out of now-where today.

He has never done any threesome or more while i have done a couple of 3somes and 1 4some before him (he doesn’t know before today), in that sense, he suggested before knowing i have tried. After which i shared i did have some experiences in group stuff.

He specifically mentioned about wanting to try cuck (him watching and participating) generally just including another party (either gender) especially when it focuses on my pleasure. 

IDK?? I mean cause i actually do like this guy, it seems abit strange and idk how to respond? We are kinda still in a situationship where we hvnt establish our status. Do i establish it first before going into trying kinks (adding people into sex life)?

Also, is it fair for me to set boundaries such as:

1. Let’s not text everyday since it feels like we are just fwb trying out kinks together 
2. Let’s not meet/share too intimate conversations anymore because it blurs the line

Would like to hear inputs about this. Was he sharing/saying all the intimate stuff just to get me vulnerable to just have kink experiences together? oh boy challenging to navigate this.😅

TL;DR - feels like i got scammed into a fwb kink situation 🤷🏻‍♀️
