Anyone else ever get so anxious that you feel sick?
I don’t want to talk about what’s making me this anxious but I feel nauseous and dizzy. I feel so awful right now and just want to check that this is anxiety symptoms and that I’m not dying. I really feel like my heart is beating too fast and I’m not breathing right. Probably just anxiety though.
