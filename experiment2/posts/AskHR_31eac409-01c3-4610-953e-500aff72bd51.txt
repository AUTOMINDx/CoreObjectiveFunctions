[WA] Manager pegged me to be replacement. Didnt even get interview
My manager months back during a 1on1 asked me about replacing him. Over the course of the next weeks he admitted he had pushed my name to his boss saying I was the perfect replacement. When the posting went live I applied. Between the time of interviews being scheduled and applying the mngr started handing over his position to me in preparation for his departure. 
Today, I found out through the grapevine that interviews for the position had begun and I hadnt gotten one. Im stunned. Not saying I was the perfect candidate, but to not even see an interview seems odd to me. My history at this job is well documented. Regularly recognized as the top employee and always see the highest % salary increase based on those merits. HR has told me that the manager in charge of the position Od applied for should have already clued me into why I wasnt to receive an interview. Have you seen this before? Im not sure where to go from here? My honest feeling is this is a red flag and I may want to start looking for another job. Any insights from HR?

UPDATE. 
Having since posted this I had a short convo with the manager who decided to not interview me. He claims that he was not interested in any internal hires. Along with my time in the current role needing some more seasoning. (Whats frustrating about that comment for me personally was I was told I wasnt ready for my current supervisor role, took 2nd to who got the job, and they completely fell behind and left me with a mess to clean up.) So I am, as you might imagine, a little sour. But with all the info you all have provided I need to just swallow my pride and realize this isnt an attack on me. To just keep doing what I do. Thank you for your time  üòÅ cheers
