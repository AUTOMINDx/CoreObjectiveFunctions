Young widow just starting to date again.
I (35F) lost my husband almost a year and a half ago. We were together about 6 years total including dating and marriage. So I haven’t been a part of the dating scene for 7-8 years give it take a few months. 

I recently decided I’m at a point where I am ready to try and move forward. It wasn’t something I decided easily. I’ve already realized what an absolute dumpster fire it can be out there but I have met one guy I’m really interested in. My age, has a job, educated, great conversation, shared interests, attractive, really nice. We have had 3 “dates.” First date was dinner. It went great. 2nd a movie and he came back to my place where we just chatted a little while, went on a walk, kissed a little. 3rd date I wouldn’t really classify as a date. I wasn’t feeling well so he offered to come keep me company. We watched a movie in our pajamas and snuggled. Perfect gentleman because he knew I wasn’t feeling well. He left after the movie ended and we hugged and kissed goodnight. 

Here’s my problem. I am a naturally shy and awkward person. I’m also a 35 year old adult who has been married and clearly has had sex in life. But it’s been so long since I’ve had to do through these motions that I have no idea how to initiate anything. Is he expecting it? Do I just blurt out what’s in my head? Is it too soon? Idk what to do.
