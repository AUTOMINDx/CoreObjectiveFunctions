Cautiously optimistic about my new therapist! Should I have a feeling that she’s good by the second or third session?
I’ve had two Ts before, and usually by the second session I would know that they weren’t the ones for me. 
This new therapist didn’t give me any feelings of that last session and my third session is tomorrow. I’m kinda excited and nervous. I actually have some things that are bothering me that I need to tell her tomorrow. 

By now I feel like I would know if I don’t wanna see her or we don’t click. 

I’m happy that I’ve almost found the one though, I’m being very cautious about declaring her the one prematurely lol
