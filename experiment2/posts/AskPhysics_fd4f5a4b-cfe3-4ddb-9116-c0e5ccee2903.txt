Two Black Holes Physics
Hello all, I have read a quick bit on the unique and strange physics that occur to an object when it is near two black holes that are in orbit with each other. I have read that this instance can cause time anomalies and other gravitational phenomena. Does anyone have more information on the topic or an explanation for why it might happen?
