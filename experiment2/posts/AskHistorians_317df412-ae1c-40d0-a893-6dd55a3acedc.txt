Looking at graphs of the history of world GDP share I'm seeing a huge spike for China around 1820. What's up with that?
I'm preparing an economics lesson about a chapter with the cheery title of "Will the West be left behind?" and digging up some statistics. Couldn't help noticing how lots of easily accesible charts like [this one on Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/1_AD_to_2003_AD_Historical_Trends_in_global_distribution_of_GDP_China_India_Western_Europe_USA_Middle_East.png) and [this other one](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/2000-years-economic-history-one-chart/) show China's all time high at around 1820, right before their long decline with the Opium Wars, unequal treaties, revolutions, foreign invasions etc. 

Now I teach history too and know a bit about Chinese history (even though sadly our curriculum barely touches it), but this is surprised me. Most of what I've read of the Qing dynasty describe it as a dysfunctional invader dynasty, and even the more positive portrayals didn't give the impression that it was the peak of prosperity. Am I mistaken and was China really that rich at the time? The charts also show India's share declining, so could it be mostly that and Europe being busy with the Napoleonic Wars?
