Been feeling really lonely in my heart lately
My heart feels so lonely.   My body feels lonely. My bed is lonely and always has been.  I slept with a woman overnight once in my life and it wasn't in my bed or hers.    She's outta my life as of 6 months now anyway. 

     I hate being alone. The one person in my whole life who I felt actually understood me abandoned me 4 and a half years ago. I've heard zero from her since and it's tough cause I loved her she said she loved me and would never ever leave "no matter what" and then one day she just walked out of my life like I never existed.   I'd give up my life just to have her back in it for a day.        I should hate her. And after years of therapy I'm just now finally able to change my mindset a bit to actually look at facts and base my emotions off them instead of "what ifs".   It helps me get over her a little bit also makes me feel worse cause she left me without warning and acted like I mean absolutely zero.    To have that from the one you love and trust the most is devestating.  My heart and mind, my physical... It all is lonely and hurt beyond explanation.      I found out a love language and a "calming language" for me is physical touch.    And I can't get it.     People say to masturbate but most of the time when I do I just get so sad. So I hardly do it so cause of that I'm not even getting happy calming chemicals at all.

Sorry this was so long. If you read this far I appreciate it. It's just been really rough lately.   I was not thinking this would be my life at 25.
