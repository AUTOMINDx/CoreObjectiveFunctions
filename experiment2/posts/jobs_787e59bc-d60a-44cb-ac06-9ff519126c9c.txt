Any job ideas helping immigrants?
I speak Spanish. I speak very well but I'm not 100% fluent. So I would prefer a job where being bilingual is a plus but nothing like a translator where I need to be very accurate. 

I have a bachelors degree in Spanish and International Studies. It's a long story but I've spent the last ten years bouncing from job to job. Pretty much all manual labor. (gym, bakery, kitchen, teaching English in South America). I just have a need to help people. Any ideas?
