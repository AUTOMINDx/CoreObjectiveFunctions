Honest opinions on CBD
I have tried every SSRI you could name since I was 18. I am now 27(female) and currently on Zoloft. No ssri has stopped me from my GAD and random panic attacks. I feel like at this point I’m over taking them.

I read a few things about CBD helping with GAD and panic disorder and was wondering if anybody here has some experience about switching to CBD instead of an SSRI or doing both. Would you recommend it? Thanks!

PS: smoking weed or taking edibles causes me to have severe panic attacks so I’m a little nervous how CBD will effect me
