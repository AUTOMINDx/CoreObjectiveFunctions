Should i come out to my mom?
So sometime ago i descovere that im by and non binary my parents have always been homophobic i've almost been outed to her by my cousin but i somehow manahed to convince her that its not true but the thing is that my cousin told my sister and a few of his friends my sister's a snitch she cant keep a secret since then my sister and my cousins friends have been thretening to tell my mom if i dont do what they say and i know tgat eventualy they will probably tell her when my cousin told her that im bi she seemed a little mad but also she seemed willingly to talk and it would be a huge stone of my chest but idk should i come out to her?
