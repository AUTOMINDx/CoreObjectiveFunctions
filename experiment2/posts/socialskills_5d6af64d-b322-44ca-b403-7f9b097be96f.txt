Struggling to convince myself that others don't hate me
I (M16) moved to a new city a couple months ago and also changed schools. For the most part I get along fine but I am struggling to build proper friendships beyond acquaintances. I think part of the issue is that I can't convince my subconscious that others like me despite having been told the opposite. My rational brain can't really come up with anything tangible of anyone disliking me in any way but I still am uncomfortable around nearly everyone and feel like I could be told to fuck off any minute. I also notice that I don't feel comfortable talking to people when I don't having reason to do so, like being assigned a group project etc.
