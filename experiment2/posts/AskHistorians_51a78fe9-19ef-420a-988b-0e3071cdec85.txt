How knowledgeable of their internal anatomy were the average person in pre-modern society?
I can see that, throughout history, there have always been people willing to open up a human cadaver. These people should be able to describe the appearance of the organs within the human body with no issue. Their thoughts on the organ's actual function may vary depending on the era, same for anyone relying on the common knowledge of the time.

But if I were to quiz the average/common person in different societies, what would their level of knowledge be? If I asked them to list off all the organs they knew, their placements, appearance and functions. Could everyone e.g. tell me what kidneys (supposedly) are and where they sit, but few know they had organs in their inner ear?

Like in the present, I'd assume certain information was more widespread. Such as people in modern times generally knowing what/where the prefrontal cortex and brain stem are, when that isn't always true for e.g. lymph nodes.
