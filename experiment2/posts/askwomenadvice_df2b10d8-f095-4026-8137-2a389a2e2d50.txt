Should I feel ashamed of myself for not working out? I’m a 15F.
I don’t work out. I have no hobby we’re I move around and be active. I quit rarely work out in any way other then at school. I am not fat or unhealthily large in any way. I do have a strong bodytipe, the one were you have wide hips and brod shoulders, but timeglass figur. I am Also quite short 5,2(157cm). This makes it easy for me to think I look fat even though I know I’m not. 
When the people I know talk about their sports I can’t help but fell ashamed that I don’t work out. Like I feel bad for not doing something that I just have a hard time making myself do. I feel awful, like as if I’m lasy and fat. I don’t know if my feelings of being ashamed are valid or stupid. Because I know working out is good for you I just can’t get myself to do it. And it doesn’t interest myself. I quite like my body, but this shame makes me doubt that my body is okay. I just don’t know. Should I feel ashamed for not working out?
