It’s so hard
Every day is a battle to fight off depression and anxiety. I’m finally understanding how my traumas are now affecting me. It’s like those parts of my brain for happiness, total relaxation, and being one with my body are just not there. “Whats wrong with me? Why am I so dumb and weak?” I always wondered. But now I at least have compassion for myself even if everyone else seems to judge me or say dumb things like “it’s all in your head” or they say what I went through wasn’t that bad but they only know the tip of the iceberg. I don’t tell them because it’s private and sensitive to me. I don’t want advice. I want a fkn hug. I don’t want to be told “it’s going to be okay”, I’m not a child. I just want to be heard.  And yeah  no shit it’s in my head, but my brain is literally broken. Those parts of me are not there. My brain refuses to be anything but hypervigilant, and a stranger to my body and emotions… i try so fkn hard. It shouldn’t be this hard to feel normal. I don’t know where I was going with this.
