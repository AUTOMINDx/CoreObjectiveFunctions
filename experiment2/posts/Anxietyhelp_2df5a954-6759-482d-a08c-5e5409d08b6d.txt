I have so much anxiety at doctor appointments from previous experiences that my heart rate spikes past 100 every time! I can even feel it increasing every time they place the heart monitor on me. Iâ€™ve conditioned it to do that by accident. Not sure what to do about this! I had a few traumatic experiences and especially before surgery my heart rate is 110 so I set off the alarm. My normal resting heart rate is 65
