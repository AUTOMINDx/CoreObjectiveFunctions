My penis is still sensitive after months of daily stimulation in the shower. What to do?
I'm not circumcised and my skin goes full behind the glans. I clean my penis every day in the shower and while cleaning I just rub slowly using my finger all over the the glans. Even after months of doing it daily I still cannot touch my glans without pain. I cannot even touch my frenulum area because it hurts so much. What should I do?
