Is Reddit shifting towards be "anti-woke?"
I frequent a lot of political subreddits. Not just the big ones, and not just ones I post in, but I lurk all over, just to see what's up. 

In the last few weeks, especially after the Democrat's loss in the Virginia, it seems a lot of liberal people on Reddit are getting sick of "woke politics" being included in every Democratic policy proposal. 

Some of the things I've noticed that liberals are having a tough time accepting are things like getting rid of gifted student programs for being racist, adding a racism component to math classes, abolishing the police, giving subsidies to POC farmers and not white farmers in the American Rescue Plan, things like that. 

It seems more and more liberals on Reddit are blaming "woke politics" for helping conservatives win elections, and that it distracts from "bread and butter" issues like healthcare.

I could be totally wrong, and this is confirmation bias, but I lurk on a large amount of political subs and it seems to be a backlash against "woke-politics" going on...
