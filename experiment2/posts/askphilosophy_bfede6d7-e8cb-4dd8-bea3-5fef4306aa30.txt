Is Hegel's Science of Logic a dated document?
I don't quite remember where I came across it sometime before. Being sleep deprived, I didnt continue to read the ensuing argument. It said that Hegel's Logic was only historically important. I've just begun Hegel's phenomenology and I'm pretty frustrated with him already. Phenomenology is going nowhere. I kind of cheated and looked up a guidebook to understand where it ends (the Absolute) and I didnt get a very proper answer. Should I pick up Heidegger and contemporary philosophy (20th Century) which probably are not 'dated'? The reason I picked up Hegel was because I thought the 20th Century misread and misrepresented Hegel and he is still very much someone we ought to read just not for historical value, but also for relevance today. He has obviously been adapted by the likes of Zizek and Malabou, but is Hegel (specifically his Logic which is his main system), in himself, not worthy of study except for his canonical position and historical relevance? I don't get what they meant by being dated and it's bugging me ever since.
