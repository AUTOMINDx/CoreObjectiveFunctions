Can asexuality develop over time?
This is a pretty weird one. Over the course of the last 2 months I (M,20) transformed from a horny bastard into someone who has lost all interest in sex. I have experienced times of low libido before, but they usually never lasted longer than maybe half a week, but never like this. Weirdly enough, I find that women do no longer physically attract me (and men still don't), which is something I never thought I'd say in my life. I've read that a loss of libido might be connected to hormonal imbalances and such things, however, I have not experienced any other problems, and, if anything, I think my hormone levels are "better" (don't know if that's the right word), since I have had some pretty great workouts this month, and feel generally healthier than I have in a long time. Don't know if all this makes much sense, or if I look stupid for asking if there's something wrong with me for feeling better than usual, but none of my friends could help me with this and them and I are all morons anyway, so I might as well ask some random people on the internet.
