[Hellboy 2004 film] Why was Liz "allowed" to leave the BRPD in the first place?
She was an unstable pyrokinetic, who, judging from what we see, didn't just cause gouts of flame, but full on explosive waves of fire. She admits that she has only just started learn to control the fire recently.

Literally the one place that was actually equipped to deal with her abilities and they just let her walk away.
