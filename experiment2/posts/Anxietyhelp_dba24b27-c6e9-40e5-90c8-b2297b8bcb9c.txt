Anxiety or Heart Problems?
Hello, I’m a 25 yr old F. When I was 15 years old my dad passed away from an overdose and I was at home when it happened. I watched everything happen, called 911, etc. I was the first to go back to see his dead body at the hospital. The whole experience was traumatizing. A couple weeks after, I started to notice I could see my heart beating in my chest. At the time I didn’t know what anxiety was. I went to the doctor and they gave me a 24 hour heart monitor to wear. I gave it back to the doctor after the 24 hrs and they called and said I needed to go get an ultra sound of my heart due to at times when I was sleeping my heart rate would reach 180. I went to the ultra sound appointment for my heart and everything was great and they said my heart was healthy. I just had anxiety so they gave me medicine. I didn’t feel this anxiety again until I was in college around the age 19 or 20. I was drinking coffee getting ready for school when my heart started palpitating. It started and scared me and continued this for a couple minutes and my mom helped calm me down. Ever since then I have been dealing with those palpitations. I have had blood work done and everything comes back good. No thyroid problems and a few months ago I did an EKG and it came out good. I am currently taking 10 MG Propranolol and the palpitations still continue. I just really want some peace of mind/relief. I also have a fear that at anytime I’m going to die so when the palpitations occur it scares me. It makes me not want to do anything that I used to enjoy. Can anyone please provide me with some kind of answers???
