Everyone knows that
Once when I was a kid, I forget how old, I went out into the woods behind our house. I was a really active kid, technically diagnosed with ADHD at that point I believe. I don’t remember why I did this but, as I was playing with sticks pretending they were swords or whatever, I looked down at the forest floor and felt a desire to just hold still. So I did. A moment later, the world exploded into motion. What seemed to my hyper self before be a stationary, dead tapestry of leaves and needles and twigs and dirt was crawling, positively TEEMING with life. Little insects going to and fro, tons of them of different varieties. Some worms too, here and there under the soil. I think I even saw a lizard at one point; they loved the firewood pile nearby. It was incredible, what I learned in that one instant from simply staying still. I remember rushing inside to tell my mom that, I figured she’d be super excited to hear what I’d discovered.

I don’t recall her exact words after I described it. Only that it was along the lines of, “Well yeah, everyone knows that”. That was it, nothing else. No interest, no praise, no encouragement or cheer or anything in her voice. Her son who she loved so much and told he was so smart. Who fucking cares? I felt deflated, like a stupid child. I wandered off to do something else.

I hate her sometimes. For stuff like this and other things she said and did. But I also feel guilty, because she took care of me when my father was away, which was most of my life. These instances were in the minority after all, for the most part. I shouldn’t let those moments of her being like this affect me. It makes me feel weak and needy and childish and stupid. And I hate her for that.
