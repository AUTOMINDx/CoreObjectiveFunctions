Telehealth vs in person behaviours in session
I’ve been seeing my T for a year and started on Telehealth. I’m quite comfortable/can easily open up to them via Telehealth, but when I see them in person I feel more guarded and am less likely to open up. 

Does anyone act a bit differently depending on whether your session is in person or Telehealth/zoom?
