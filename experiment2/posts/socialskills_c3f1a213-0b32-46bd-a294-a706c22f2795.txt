How do I overcome my awkwardness? I feel like everyone has a good time at work and I’m neutral
I started a new job of a growing laboratory. I kind of just sit down and do my work. I don’t talk to anyone or seek anyone out. 

I kind of just sit and read. 

But I feel the rest of the staff talks a lot and there is a lot of laughing. I kind of feel things get quiet when I’m around. 

I tried a joke today, where my one supervisor said “I need you to sign a paper” where I said “is it for my soul?” And she laughed at first then realized it wasn’t funny. 

Either way. I feel super awkward at work and I’m not sure how to overcome it.  I’m naturally not very social. It makes me paranoid that they’ll fire me because of my social skills. 

Any advice?
