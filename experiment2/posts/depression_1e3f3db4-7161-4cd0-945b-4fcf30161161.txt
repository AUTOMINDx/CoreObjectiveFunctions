I no longer have any reasons to live
My favorite hobbies don't bring me joy anymore. Things like music, video games, and watching videos no longer make me happy. I don't have any genuine friends that I hang out with afterschool or online to make me happy either. Nobody cares about me except my parents and my therapist.

I no longer have any reasons to live, all I have now is a reason why I haven't killed myself. It's because death is scary. Every day I think about overdosing and ending it all. But that's the problem. Will I literally end when I die? Is there an afterlife? Reincarnation? The thought of just ceasing to exist terrifies me, even though I want to get rid of this pain.

But, since my reasons to live have disappeared, perhaps that fear will also disappear one day.
