Need to get out of job but don't even know where to start
I am currently a business analyst (1 year and change) and it's depressing. There is no structure to my job. I have borderline no idea how to do the actual analysis because every project is different and there are no clear guidelines outside of infrastructure. I lack motivation in part because to me, it seems like my work disappears into a black hole once it leaves my hands. I slack off 85% of the time and fear that I'm going to be fired if I don't quit (though I've never been reprimanded for this, it's the type of situation that will come to bite me in the ass). The coworkers I started with feel similarly though they are better employees.

My post title isn't entirely true - I know that I either need something with direction or to pursue my dreams of being in the film industry. With the latter, I also fear: going back to low-pay; gig work/unstable employment; no health insurance (I am 24 and can remain on my parents' for a little while longer but eventually I will lose it); potentially never making the amount of money I'm making now again (which isn't a lot relatively speaking, just more than if I was entry-level in film; being 24 and living at home; being unable to move out if I go back to low-paying work and the social issues that brings; among other things.

I have a computer science degree. Couldn't get a programming job for a year of off-and-on applications after graduation. I don't know if I even want to stick with what that degree offers. If I'm not in a creative position, I think I need structure and direction.

Where do I start?
