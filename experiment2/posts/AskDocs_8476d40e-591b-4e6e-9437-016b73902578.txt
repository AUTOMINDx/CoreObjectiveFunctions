My mental health is getting worse again- how can I deal with this without a therapist?
17F, white, drink/smoke socially every now and then (less so recently as I’ve had friends concerned about mental state), history of ED (anorexia) and self harm, though I’ve always suspected something underlying is wrong (prone to feeling depressed and sometimes anxious). 

I frequently feel incredibly tired and this makes me feel worse emotionally as I can’t complete my work for college to the level I would like, everything I do is draining and I get in trouble for not being able to get out of bed in the morning. I get by in my day to day life (I can get to college and meet up with friends) but I never feel 100% right. Recently I’ve been getting more anxious about whether anyone actually likes me, I feel my mental state has pushed people away one way or another, but I’m unsure if I’m just paranoid. I’ve started having more thoughts of ‘maybe I should just kill myself’ (I’m not going to) or getting worried I won’t be able to get the life I want in the future because I can’t cope with feeling like this. I worry a lot about death (or myself and others) and the fact that life is short but I’m incapable of making the most of it. 

I’m easily angered and overall I feel like my emotions control my life more than I do. I was like this a few years ago and I was miserable, from experience it just gets worse and worse. How do I stop this happening again? I can’t cope with it this time. I am unable to go to therapy this is not an option (no therapist at my college either). Any advice is appreciated, thanks :)
