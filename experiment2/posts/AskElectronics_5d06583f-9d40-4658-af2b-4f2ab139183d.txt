Fuse applications On PCB's
So I am currently trying to repair a circuit board on a piece of medical equiptment and have to customize the fuse holders since the original ones are missing. I can order new fuse holders but a lot of what is listed is holders for 5mmx22mm fuses and I am wondering if I can use that size fuse in place of a 1/4" x 1-1/4" fuse that the board is designed for. As long as the specs are right then it should be fine unless there is a safety issue with potential arching. I'm just trying to get some answers so I know my options here andI am still learning so I have to be sure it is done correctly.
