Tired of therapy
I've seen different therapists for the past 3 years.. 
The last one is the best so far but i can't help but feel how pointless therapy is. 
I don't see any drastic changes in my life and what I've learned from therapy could have been learned from a book so i didn't need all these sessions really.

I'm tired of this all. Tired of having to open up. Tired of asking for help when at the end of the day it doesn't feel like I'm getting that much. 
I got asked what were my expectations of therapy and to be honest i don't know.
I'm just tired and want to be left alone 
Should I go with my gut and just leave?
