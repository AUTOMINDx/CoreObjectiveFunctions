Have you ever had to take care of your parents in times of their emotional distress?
I already asked this question last time but this time, I want to hear it from a child's perspective, either you had to care for your parents as a child and/or as an adult.

A webtoon I'm currently reading motivated me to answer this question. In the comic, a boy committed suicide &amp; his mother was severely depressed. In fact, she's so broken down emotionally that her youngest son was asked to be her caretaker. The thing is, he was young &amp; in no position to take care of an adult but his mom needed him. To console her. To sympathize with her. To tell her everything's alright. All this time, he stuffed his emotions down because if his mom ever saw him get emotional, she'll not only break down again, but she'll probably get really irritable. And so, he needed to keep a happy face for her at all times. He never got a chance to come to terms with his big brother's death &amp; never had a chance to express grief. 

When I look at the comments of my last post, someone mentioned something that perfectly describes the situation in the comic: parentification. In this case, the young boy became the parent &amp; the mom became the child.

So, I want to know if there's anybody out there who had to be their parent's caretaker in times of their emotional turmoil. How does it make you feel?
