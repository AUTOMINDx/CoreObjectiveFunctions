Another night spent here lying awake struggling to catch my breath..

I feel dirty. It’s been years yet I still want to scrub my body raw in hopes of getting you off of me.

Every time I close my eyes I feel your body crushing mine. I feel the cold barrel of the gun against my trembling head. I feel you inside of me, violating me. 

I am so angry about what you did to me, about what you took from me, and the ease with which you destroyed me. 

I can’t hold this inside me, alone yet I am alone, terrified, frozen.
