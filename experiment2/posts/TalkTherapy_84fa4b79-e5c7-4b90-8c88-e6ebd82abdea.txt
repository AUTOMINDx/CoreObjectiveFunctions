6 sessions in and I’m still so anxious, rarely make eye contact, and can’t stop saying sorry (nervous tic) and getting confused/disorganized in session
Is anxiety and nervousness in session a kind of transference? Is this normal? At least half of every session is wasted because I’m too jumpy/nervous to be coherent or think straight. I spend so much time engaged in nervous verbal tics, explaining myself, apologizing, etc. I don’t finish half my sentences. I also don’t look at my therapist very often at all, never when I’m speaking, so I miss all the verbal cues. Also I should say this is all happening over zoom. 

It’s not my therapist’s fault. He is so nice. This is just how I am with almost everyone. I’m worried my therapist is getting impatient with me. I’m not even sure what my goals for therapy are except to reduce anxiety but the anxiety is getting in the way. 

I told him some of this and he said it was all good and that it’s not wasting time in session, because working with and through the anxiety while it’s happening is very useful. He also said my nervousness around him could be transference, which is normal and useful information to have, and we can work through it.

In addition to my anxiety I’m working though some past “small t” traumas.

Is this normal and is my therapist secretly frustrated/impatient?
