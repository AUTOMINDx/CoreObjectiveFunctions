What jobs can I apply to with a Masters in Health Science degree?
Hi all
I got my degree 3/2020 then covid shut everything down. I have applied to hundreds of jobs but no luck. I tailor my resume to match each job description and have also gotten professional help. What job titles can I get with my degree? 

Any advice about recruiters, companies, etc. is helpful
