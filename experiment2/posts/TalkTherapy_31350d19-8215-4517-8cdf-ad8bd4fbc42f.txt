What is existential psychotherapy?
I have just finished 3 months of therapy with a charity in the UK, and the psychotherapist I saw there made me a shortlist of psychotherapists he thought would be suitable to carry on working with me. 

One of the guys he recommended (who I have booked a consultation with) describes himself as an existential psychotherapist. Can anyone explain in simple terms what this means? I have tried Googling but still not quite grasping it!
