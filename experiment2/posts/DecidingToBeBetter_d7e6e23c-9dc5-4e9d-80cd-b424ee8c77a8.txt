Deleted TikTok for the sake of my mental health
y’all, this app is so TOXIC. for the past month or so i’ve become increasingly insecure, angry, irritable, triggered (SO easily) and emotionally numb. i’ve not been able to be present, have had constant ear worms (songs stuck in my head) and have absolutely spiralled. i’ve lashed out at loved ones and pushed friends away. my memory and attention span has gone to shit, i’m constantly zoning out. comparison, low self-esteem and self doubt have been rampant. as someone who is prone to depressive episodes, these symptoms are somewhat normal during certain seasons, but i’ve realised that i’ve also been spending SO much time on tiktok. i finished my degree a month ago, so boredom has had me wasting a lot of time on this app and i can really feel its effects. wish me luck as i do a tik tok detox (for the 6173rd time this year). it’s a terrible app and definitely makes my mental health decline.

edit: guys i love reddit. it's so cool how so many people can share and comment on their experiences. i'm glad i'm not the only one who finds this app a soul sucking shithole. would love to keep hearing more about your experiences!

edit 2: i knew this would generate some conversation and discussion but didn’t realise it’d blow up like this! i’d love to get through everyone’s comments but there’s so many. thank you so much for sharing your experiences and struggles - helps me feel so much less alone!
