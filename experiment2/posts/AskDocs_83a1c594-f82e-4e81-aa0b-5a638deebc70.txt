I have an unidentified bacterial infection that is very resistant to antibiotics
41M. Non smoker, non drinker, no recreational drugs. 166cms, 130lbs. Canada. No other medical problems, no other medications. 

In May 2021, I developed urethritis from an STI. I had discharge and dysuria. All tests to identify have come back negative. I have had repeated first void urine tests as well as Microgen DX testing.  Mgen testing is difficult in Canada but has also been negative.  I have been treated with 7 rounds of antibiotics over the course of several months. I do not have discharge or dysuria anymore but I have other symptoms. I currently have meatitis, balanoposthitis, and testicular pain. The pain from these symptoms is slowly worsening over the past few months. 

My doctors do not know what to do at this point. Any help or ideas is welcomed. I’m at the end of my rope and I’m tired of fighting this battle.
