Strange question, what does hunger feel like?
I’ve had GERD and stomach issues for several years and I just finally started following a GERD friendly diet and making myself eat again after not eating for weeks. It’s been several days that I stopped eating “trigger foods” and I’ve been feeling much better, my stomach pain is almost completely gone but I still get occasional pain from my gallbladder. I make myself eat every two hours now usually but now it’s been almost 4 hours since I’ve eaten anything and I’ve been having a very odd feeling. I keep feeling like I might throw up when I burp and my stomach keeps growling. Is this hunger? I haven’t had this feeling so I’m not sure if it means I need to go throw up acid or if im hungry? I haven’t been having diarrhea and my fiancé and his family feel good so I don’t know if it’s a stomach virus I somehow could have gotten at work? Is this normal?
