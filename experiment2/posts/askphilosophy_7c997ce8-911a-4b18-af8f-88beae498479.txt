What is a kantian stance on mandatory vaccines for the general population
Im asking this question since its a recent issue. In my country we are heading towards a lockdown again - the health system wont have capacity for everyone if we dont enforce people to reduce their contacts. This of course is some infringement on personal rights and autonomy, and in some respects, affects the physical health and general well being and flourishing of people. Of course, we might ask wether a lockdown is appropriate from a kantian perspective, but it seems to me we might lose our general stability and dignity if we let our health system collapse. 

More pressingly, this issue could be prevented. around 20% of the adult population refuse to get vaccinated, and I think it is fair to assume the reasons for the majority of them are either misinformation, grudge, or mental problems like conspiracy thinking. Its reasonable to assume that pressuring them into deciding to take the vaccine by fining them if they dont do it will generally prevent harmful lockdowns for the rest of the population or will prevent health system failure.

Please not that this is not about physically forcing them to get the vaccine. But it is about declaring it a mandatory duty that will be sanctioned if one fails to commit.   
How is this approached from a kantian morality? It seems less clear than utilitarian approaches, where I would assume the answer is clearly yes to a mandatory vaccination.
