Have an accounting degree, going back for a CS degree - not sure about where to go?
I have an accounting degree and I decided to go back for a CS postbacc (bad idea, whoops). I have decent aptitude for programming in general. I decided to go for it since I enjoyed writing scripts in excel and python. About to graduate, but not sure if I should go down the path to being a SWE now. 

I can see myself enjoying any type of desk job that's somewhat technical - Accounting / Finance, Data Analytics, or SWE. 

Argument against SWE / Analytics - oversaturated, can't see myself doing a million Leetcode problems / brainteasers every 2 years and spending a lot of time learning outside of work.

Argument against Finance / Accounting - would likely have to start in public. I hate wearing suits. 

Currently my goal in life currently is just to make 60k and cap out at 120k career wise (HCOL - SF). Pretty decent communication skills. Where should I go from here?
