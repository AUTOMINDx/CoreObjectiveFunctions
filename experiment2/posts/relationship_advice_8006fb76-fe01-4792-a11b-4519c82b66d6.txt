DV
Throwaway account. Not much to say aside from I (25f) was physically abused by my significant other (40m) for the first time. Nothing crazy, just bruises on my arms and neck. Just need a friend. He’s sound asleep… it’s almost 5AM &amp; I’m wide awake and really just needing a friend right now. Feeling pretty worthless.

Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect this many people to actually care. For all asking, I am safe. I spent the entire day yesterday in bed and to myself. Still trying to process everything that’s happened. Thank you everyone for your kindness. I wish I could put into words how much it means to me.
