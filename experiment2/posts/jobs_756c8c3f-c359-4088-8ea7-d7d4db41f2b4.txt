Should I take a research job offer that pays just above minimum?
Hi all, I am 21 and will be graduating with my bachelor's degree in psychology in a few weeks. I've been applying for jobs in my area, and so far have only been getting offers that I wouldn't really be able to make rent from. I recently got offered a research tech position that I would love to take, except there is 0 room for salary negotiation (believe me, I tried). For context, I have a better offer for a job starting next fall, so this would only be for the spring semester and the summer. I'm in the US

Pros:
Through my university, so I can expect excellent benefits and tuition remission for my Master's.
The opportunity to learn a ton about research. This would look excellent on my resume. 
It seems like a good work environment.

Cons:
Pay is 13/hr (for reference, I currently make 11.50/hr at student employment)

I feel like that's too low for someone with a bachelor's degree, and although I don't have work experience in research, I do have a lot of student research experience and a certificate in a popular data analysis program. I also am not sure if that's enough to live on. I already said I would take the job since they said they wouldn't negotiate and I wasn't exactly sure if this was worth passing on the offer. Can I change my mind?


Any advice from those of you with more knowledge and experience? 
Thanks!

Edit: there are a few minor details changed, I'd hate to dox myself
