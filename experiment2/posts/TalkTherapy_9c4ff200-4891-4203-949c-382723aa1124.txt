Is it appropriate for me to get therapy
Hello,

I am 17 years old, and when I was around 13-14 I did something really terrible. I know it probably sounds like I am exaggerating but what I did was absolutely unforgivable and disgusting and I can’t forget about it. I was not the victim in this situation and I can’t talk to anyone about it because it would hurt everyone around me, including my family and the family of the victim. I’m also scared of the consequences that I might face from my actions from when I was younger. (I know I’m being extremely selfish)

Would it be appropriate for me to get a session of therapy even if I am not the victim, and would confidentially be broken even if it is something I did three years ago?

Sorry for the long post.
