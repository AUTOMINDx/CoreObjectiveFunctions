AITA for calling my dad's gf "mum" even though she's younger than me?
I never had a mother. Not because of any unfortunate reasons, but my father just adopted me (34M today, 3y/o at the time) as a single dad and never married. He was an **awesome** father, and I'm so proud of him for so many reasons. His dating habits, not one of them.

To be blunt, dad used to be a serious a philanderer. My entire life growing up was a revolving door of women, always aged between 19 to 26. They always ended more-or-less for the same reason after a few months. But then came Cleo.

When I was 26, dad met Cleo (21 at the time). I don't know what it was about her, but they worked. I swear on my shiny-Espeon that she's the longest, healthiest relationship he's ever been in. They're still together, and given that my dad really doesn't have a lot, I'm skeptic to believe it's anything but genuine.

Here's the thing. I've never had a mother figure. I've also always got along really well with Cleo. She's one of my dearest friends. It was Christmas around year 3 of their relationship (I think) when I went through the check-list of what I'd have wanted from a mother when I realized she hit pretty much all of the checks. She respected my boundaries, was kind, supportive, took a healthy interest, etc.. So, one day, more as a joke than anything, I called her "Mum". It just sorta kept? Its become a term of endearment as much as it is a nickname, and I've been calling her mum ever since.

Well, the other day my son, 3yo, called Cleo grandma, and my wife (36F) did not like it. She took me aside later and told me it was time I stopped calling Cleo "mum" because it's now 'confusing' our kid. She also said it's not right to be calling someone 'so much younger than me' mum in the first place, and admitted to me she's never been comfortable with it, thinking it's gross. I want to make it clear I started dating my wife *after* I started calling Cleo "mum".

I told my wife that there's no harm in it, and that her not liking it is a 'her' problem. I also made it clear that I wasn't going to stop calling Cleo something I've been calling her for the past 4-5 years just because she wasn't comfortable with it, and her being younger than me has nothing to do with the reason I call her "mum".

Well, this has become a **serious** argument now, and I've been called a massive AH by my wife for deliberately and knowingly continuing to do something she doesn't like this much. My wife actually got Cleo involved. She thinks that it's not worth sacrificing my relationship with my wife over. Dad think's we're both AH for how we're handling it, but also neither of us are AH's for our reasons.

Guys?
