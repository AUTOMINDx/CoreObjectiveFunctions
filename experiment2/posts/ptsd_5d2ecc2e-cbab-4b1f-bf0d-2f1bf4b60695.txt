Anniversaries questions
Next Monday will mark 6 years since my first sexual assault and on the 28th, it will mark 5 years since my second assault. I always struggle around this time of year anf this year is no different. I'm not sleeping well at all and flashbacks/dreams have become more intense. I've tried melatonin with no luck. 

Any ideas of what I should do? I do see a therapist twice a month if I'm lucky. No psychiatist though.
