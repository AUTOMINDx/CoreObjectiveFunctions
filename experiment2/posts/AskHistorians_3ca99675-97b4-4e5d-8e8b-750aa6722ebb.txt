Connection between Sami people of Scandinavia and Native Americans
Hello,

Something I've been pondering lately. The Sami have their [Lavvu](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Sami_Tent_in_Jukkasjarvi.jpg/220px-Sami_Tent_in_Jukkasjarvi.jpg) while Native American have their [Tipi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Oglala_girl_in_front_of_a_tipi2.jpg). Not only that but they kind of look alike too. Do they all originate from Siberia?

Is it possible that the Sami people made the same travels as Leif Eriksson? Iceland &gt; Greenland &gt; North America.
