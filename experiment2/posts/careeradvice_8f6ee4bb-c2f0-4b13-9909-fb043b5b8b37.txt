Using Offer for Counter Offer, is there a limit of times I can do this?
**Question**:

Should I use an offer from a new company to have my current company counter even though I have already done this? If I do this, am I likely going to see some career retribution as soon as the company's position improves?

**Situation**:

I am probably going to get a job offer that is about 20k above my current rate. I am in job that is in demand in the Salesforce Developer Field. For example, my current company has two openings for an addition to my job. One has been open for a year (in Asia) and the other, in the US has been open for six months. We have yet to find anyone remotely qualified.  (I am using a throw away account and am trying to avoid giving too much).

I do like my company and the location for our hybrid WFH model. If my current company countered, I probably would stay however my wife says since I got an offer and a sizable pay bump a few years ago, I cannot do it twice with the same company. And even if I do, I will pay for it later as soon as they can move away from me.

My thought is that the market rules do not apply. It is not as if my company has paid me egregiously, it is just that the market for my position has moved very quickly in the last couple years.
