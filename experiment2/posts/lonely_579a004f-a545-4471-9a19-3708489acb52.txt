(20M) Just need someone to care
I have a lot to talk about but I don't have anyone I can talk to. I have a few people that say they are my friends but I never see them and I don't believe that they care. I just turned 20 today and my life is already in shambles and its only gonna get worse. Why does my life have to be so cruel and why do I have to be aware enough to understand that its not normal to live like this. Im so fucked up and I don't know how to cope anymore
