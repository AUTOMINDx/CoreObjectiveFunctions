[DC] What is Batman‘s average respons time to the bat-signal lightning up when he‘s not on duty?
Because if you think about it: Depending on his current location, he would have to get to Wayne manor, get into the Batcave, get suited up as Batman, get the Batmobile ready, drive all the way into Gotham City, would then meet up at the Bat-Signal to get informed about the situation and only then could he respond to whatever is happening. We‘re talking about at least half an hour till he can respond whatever reason why the bat-signal is up. Couldn‘t it be very well possible that whatever incident lead the police to calling Batman is already over by that time?
