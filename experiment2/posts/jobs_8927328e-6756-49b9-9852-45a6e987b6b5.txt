Jobs Relating to Outer Space
I’ve been wanting to change my job to something I actually enjoy, and I realized that I’m very interested in space and always have been. I feel like a lot of the jobs relating to space is in the engineering field which I’m not in. Are there any other jobs that you recommend that involve space, but not engineering? I’m in the business consulting field at the moment and am even willing to go back to school if I have to, I’m just confused on what to study. This has been on my mind for a while, so recommendations would be much appreciated because I’m so lost!
