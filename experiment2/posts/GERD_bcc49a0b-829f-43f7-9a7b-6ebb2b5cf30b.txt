Stomach acid cause soreness ?
Can acidity cause soreness in my upper left chest muscle , I feel soreness there and sometimes it burns as well .heart related tests were all clear!
Has anyone experienced this and if they fixed it ?
I'm taking Omeprazole 20mg daily .Experience unique breathing discomfort when it flares up

Thanks
