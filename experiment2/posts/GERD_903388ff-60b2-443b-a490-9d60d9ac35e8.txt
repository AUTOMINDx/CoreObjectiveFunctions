Dessert spices as triggers?
I was doing pretty well after my 4 week reflux diet, so when TG came, I relaxed a little. Didn’t eat anything I didn’t cook, stayed away from garlic and onion, but let myself have sweet potato and apple pies, egg nog, a touch of caffeine…. The reflux is back now, but I don’t know why. I was also eating them with ice cream and whipped cream, but I haven’t noticed myself having an issue with fat. Though there is, I guess, more in a cup of ice cream than a pat of butter.

I think cinnamon is a trigger for me, but that seems fake, because it’s not a trigger for anyone. Also ginger, also seems fake. Do I just give up on autumn? And like…enjoying things? Super frustrated because I was functioning normally, eating almost everything (but drinking only water and black tea lattes) before I started this stupid diet, and now it seems like everything gives me reflux. I’m probably just noticing more, but that doesn’t really make it better.
