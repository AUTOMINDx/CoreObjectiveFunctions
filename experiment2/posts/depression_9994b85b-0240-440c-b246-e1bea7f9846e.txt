I cry uncontrollably at night and I don’t know why
I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and am currently on Lexapro, and throughout the day I’m usually alright but as it gets later into the night I find myself getting suicidal and very sad, sometimes to the point where I’m silently sobbing as I lay in bed at night.

Not just softly crying but aggressively crying to the point where I have to try my hardest not to make any noise which would wake up my family because I just want to scream and let it all out.

I try and distract myself by going on Reddit or watching YouTube but it doesn’t get rid of the immense pain I feel late at night.

I’m just wondering if anyone else feels this way? Could I be bipolar?
