I don’t believe in quitting, but I’m still allowed to feel anxious.
A few months back, my (then) gf of 4 years revealed to me that she had been cheating on me and that she wanted to break up with me. I was heartbroken. As time’s moved on, I’ve felt better for the most part, but every now and again, I feel uneasy (bad dreams, I see a car that looks like her’s, etc). Tonight, I had a business request come in looking for a comedian at their holiday party (I’m a comedian btw). I was thrilled, and then I saw the address: literally half a mile from where my ex lives. I need the money, I love to perform, but I’ve literally been having a mini anxiety attack ever since I saw the location of this place.

Again, I’d be a fool if I gave this offer up just because of her, but how do I push forward knowing that she’ll be nearby? Furthermore, what do I do if she (and her bf) are in there (it’s a restaurant)?
