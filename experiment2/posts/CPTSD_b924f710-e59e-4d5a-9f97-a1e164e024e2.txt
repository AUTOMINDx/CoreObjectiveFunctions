Does anyone else uncover and re-repress memories in a loop?
I always have revelations and then suddenly remember the last time I had the exact some one, or take them to therapy and be gently told we did this one. My poor doc, she is amazing, and we do work through the whole memory and it's relevance again. I have a feeling it happens even more than she tells me.

I know I've been repressing since early childhood, because I also have multiple memories of abusive things being explained to me (I.e. did you know your name is \_\_ but we call you *insult* because you're filthy) at different ages and in each memory, I was learning it for the first time. 

My short term memory is pretty good for work even though I write more things down than others. My long term memory is generally a dumpster fire but it's really good for certain random things like books I haven't read for a long time. It seems pretty bad for normal, fun adult things as well. I know I hang out with friends now, but I don't know a lot of details. 

I journal obsessively if I want to look it up, but will I ever stop doing this and be able to have a decent picture of my life? I'm 29, if I make it to middle aged, will I be senile early?

And what about y'all?
