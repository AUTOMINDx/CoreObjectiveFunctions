PhD Stipendium in Germany
Hi, I will soon finish my Master's Degree at a good german University in Biotechnology and wondered, how easy it is to get an Stipedium for my following PhD. Or in other words: I'm among the top 5 percent based on my grades within my year, does this make getting a stipendium easier?
