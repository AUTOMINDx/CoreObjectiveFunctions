My family can’t stand me!!
My family is my mother and two sisters (who have two children each). I’m the eldest and I don’t have any children, by choice. Neither of them work right now and one of them has never worked. She doesn’t even job hunt. 

They hate me because I happen to be different. Yes, I’m uptight and introverted and it’s difficult for them to relate to me. But they hate me so much, when they hear that I’m around they would rather not come come to see my mother.

One year I spent Christmas alone because one of them told my mother that if I came home she would take her kids and go, thereby punishing my mother. My mother loves them both. She would do anything for them. When it’s just me and her she often sits by the gate wondering when they will back.

She doesn’t like me much. She loves me me because I’m the one who supports her financially. Otherwise she would rather not be around me at all. 
My nieces and nephews used to be the sweetest but now they disrespect me and couldn’t care less.

I sacrificed everything for my family, as the only person in the house that had a job for years. I supported a family of 7 with one salary. Now I’m a freelancer and I don’t have a steady income they treat me like shit!

The joke is that I actually love family and I’m always planning things that we can do together.

As I write this, my sister walked out because she did something very irresponsible and I called her out on it. So, she took her bags and left. Now my mom is worried.

I need to get the fuck out of here. I’m 39 years old and I basically have no family. Fuck me!!!
