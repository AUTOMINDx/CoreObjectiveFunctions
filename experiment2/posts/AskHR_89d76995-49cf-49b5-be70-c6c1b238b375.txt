[IL] New position, hourly to salary, no contract?
I recently took a new position within the same company. It's a move up the ladder within a new department with a new boss. I am currently hourly but this will be a salary position. The payrate was given to me in an hourly form though. I start tomorrow but have signed no contract, etc. When I reached out to the HR recruiter a week ago to see what needed to be done, I was told to just get a new badge with my new title. I feel like there needs to be more than this though?
