My mom once told me she had a bad dream about me dating a rich guy and my 7th house ruler is Jupiter in the 2nd house.
Obviously I know that wealth isn’t guaranteed but I heard that Jupiter in 2nd house can sometimes indicate wealth and my Jupiter is also in cancer. My 7th house ruler is also Jupiter and I know that also has something to do with your spouse. Here’s where things get kinda weird. Not too long ago my mom told me she had a bad dream about me dating a rich guy. She said things were going fine then it just went south. She didn’t really explain why or what happened but she seemed pretty shaken up by it and asked me if I was dating anyone at the time (I wasn’t). She isn’t into astrology but is very religious. Just thought this was kinda interesting would love to hear some thoughts!
