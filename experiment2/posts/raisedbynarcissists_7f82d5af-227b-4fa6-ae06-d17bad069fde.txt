I SHARED MY STORY OF BEING RAISED BY NARCISSISTIC ABUSIVE PARENTS THANKS TO YOU. THANKS TO YOU ALL!
I've been reading the subreddit for a long time and it's given me such strength to first leave my parents house and break free but to also now tell my story on a podcast about my life. It was so cathartic. I'm so proud of myself and I just wanted to thank everyone here sooooooooooooo much. If it wasn't for all of you, I couldn't have done it.
