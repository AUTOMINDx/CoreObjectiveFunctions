[Marvel but not really] What exactly is the difference between telekinesis and force field generation?
If I recall correctly, telekinetic characters like Jean Grey can use their telekinesis to create force fields, and force field generators like the Invisible Woman can create little tiny force fields to act as a pseudo-telekinesis. Whatâ€™s the difference between the two powers if people can use both for the same things?
