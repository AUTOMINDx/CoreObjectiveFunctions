My social skills have gone so down hill that i dont even know who I am anymore.
I've realized I've been trying to be cool and not myself and people pick up on that anf get annoyed by it and refuse to speak to me.

When I was 18 i moved to an environment that was mentally toxic for me with a new family. I still live here with them unfortunately and I know they're most of the reason for my social anxiety i have. 5 years later I still have no friends in the area, im losing friends and family members my age group are leaving me out of things.

I'd like to improve on my social skills but i dont know how to or where to start. Those of you who are going to say "well just go out and talk to people more" how can i do that if no one wants to talk to me. I need guidance on what to and what not to say or something. I just want to be normal with friends, going to parties and doing normal 20 year old things.
