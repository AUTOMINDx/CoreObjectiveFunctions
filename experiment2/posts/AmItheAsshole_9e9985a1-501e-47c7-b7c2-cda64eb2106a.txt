AITA For calling for calling my cousin's dress beautiful?
I was at a family gathering two days ago for thanksgiving with my girlfriend of 2 years. I was hanging out and my cousin (F21) noticed me and came over to talk. It was just the normal stuff, how are you, what's up, etc. She pointed to her dress and asked how she looked and I said beautiful. 

Right after I said this my girlfriend, who had been behind me talking to someone else, came over and asked who she was. I said she was my cousin and she got a weird expression on her face. She joined in on the conversation and eventually when my cousin walked away she pulled me aside and was really angry with me for calling my cousin beautiful. I told her I was talking about her dress and I was just being nice. She still thought it was weird and when we got home she called me out on it. She's convinced I was being a creep or something and is mad at me. 

Am I an asshole?
