shitty 'friend'
So I've been friends with this guy for about a year now, give or take. We used to be very close. He called me family at many points. Well, recently, he's been growing distant, and making up excuses for not meeting up with me, saying he's busy with school &amp; revision. He's also been on his phone texting his girlfriend and random people non stop every time we met up recently. And he's been going home very early, whereas before, we'd stay out for hours on end. Yet he still sees other people, and stays out with them til 11 at night, when he literally said the day before that he doesn't know how often he's gonna be out because of 'revison'. Yeah, he says that, but he does drugs when he's out, and that goes to show he doesn't give a fuck about 'revision'- he came whining to me when he got a D on his last test. Might cut him off. Just wanted to rant. I will add that I'm on the spectrum, so I'm used to people leaving me after I get too comfortable and let my 'normal' mask slip up, so there's that. Don't know how to take this. I kinda want to back off, but I don't want him completely leaving my life.
