proud, because i just flat-out refused a resentment-laced gift from nMom
short backstory: I have a pair of winter boots that I love, that my mom has never really liked. This past year, they got a hole in them and needed to be repaired and polished, so I asked her to take them to the repairman for me, since I moved out and they were still at my parents' house. She kept telling me they wouldn't be worth it and I should just buy new boots. I told her I'd take them myself if she didn't want to, but she did it anyway.

Today, I received texted photos of the boots in her car, with no comment. I said "thank you! how much were they?" so I could pay her for them. She said "don't worry about it", which felt bad to me. I didn't want this to be a gift, since she didn't even seem particularly enthused to take them for me. So I insisted and paid anyway. Here was the full play-by-play:

*nMom: \[sends photos of boots\]*  
*me: "thank you!!! how much was it?"*  
*nMom: "Don't worry about it"*  
*nMom: "They're darker than pix shows. Not sure if ure gonna like"*  
*me: "i'm sure they're fine! i remember you being sorta discouraging of me getting them fixed in the first place, so i'd rather just pay ya for em. i can venmo dad. $50?"*  
*nMom: "Ya."*  
*me: "done!"*  
*nMom: "He washed w special soap n water. Twice .... let dry a week."*  
*nMom: "Then polish n protect. Then added rubber heels on both to cover holes."*  
*me: "beautiful"*

Feels good to just not entertain these acts of "kindness" from people who clearly don't actually want to be doing it, but want the "woe is me" act and the weird guilt that I feel afterwards. Also the weird vibe of her telling me all the crazy lengths that the shoe repairman went to .. to repair my shoes. It just felt weird. Like ... great. thanks. I don't need this noise and these weird vibes. I'm an adult and can take care of myself.

Proud of this small interaction and wanted to share it with y'all. &lt;3
