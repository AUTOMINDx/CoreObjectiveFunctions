December Daily Challenge
Hey everyone, hope you are doing well!

I have been making some good progress lately with facing my fears and was wondering if anyone wanted to try a daily challenge for the month of December. I've tried this approach in the past with things like abstaining from drinking or meditating and it is really motivational for me to keep up a streak. I am planning to leave my house every day for the whole month! I'm trying to get used to leaving daily to prepare for my next big goal, getting a job. Let me know if any of you are interested!

Edit: if you are interested just post your goal below! I will post a new thread each day in December where we can all share our successes or ask for support.
