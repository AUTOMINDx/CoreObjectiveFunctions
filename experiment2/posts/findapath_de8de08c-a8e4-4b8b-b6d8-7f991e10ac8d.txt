Entry-level music or health-related jobs?
I know these are extremely different, but I’m very interested in both. I have a psychology bachelors degree and attended grad school, but ended up leaving after feeling like I wasn’t in the right place. Wondering how in the world to get involved with music as a career (interested in composition, conducting, and performance) or a health-related field (interested in nutrition, athletic training, sports nutrition, holistic health) without going back to school. If that’s the only answer, I will. I just want some experience first to be a little more confident. I’ve seeked out personal training jobs, but they just don’t pay anywhere near what I’m making now working in HR, so it’s been hard to justify a change. Just looking for some ideas that I may not have thought about yet. Any advice helps!
