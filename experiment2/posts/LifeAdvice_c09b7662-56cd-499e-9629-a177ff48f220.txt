Is growing up about maintaining superficial statuses?
I was having this discussion with my special other today, and we both feel like in order to progress as adults we feel this pressure from society to gravitate towards social groups and maintaining a certain level of relationships via small talk, fancy events, etc  regardless of how superficial they are, just for the sake of keeping a status. 

We are both in our early 20s, and we are very much happy with each other but feel that we may become isolated from the rest of the world and it might be too late to come back from it later. Or maybe this is the norm that everyone goes through, I'm not sure.

Anyone have any advice regarding this situation? More specifically, can we "grow up" without doing all of these seeminglessly pointless formalities?
