Mounting multiple bent TO220s below Heatsink
Hello everyone

I am trying to mount multiple TO220 packages below a heatsink similar to the way the MOSFET is mounted in this picture:

So far I had issues screwing all packages into the heatsink because of mechanical misplacement. It seems like the TO220 packages have wome "whiggling room" when I solder them onto the PCB. This leads to small errors in the positioning of the MOSFET hole which in turns makes it difficult to screw the packages in.

How do you normally handle this issue? Should I mount the MOSFETs first onto the heatsink and only after that solder it to the PCB?
