I just need someone to talk to
I've been wanting to seek therapy for awhile, but as of right now I'm kinda short on cash, so I can't afford therapy for now. Though I've been wanting to talk to someone who can give me at least some guidance on my situation since mentally speaking, I'm dying, my mental state is just getting worse and worse by the day, I would just like some advice on how to improve my situation for my mental health.
