I don't have social media and I think that affects my dp/dr?
I got rid of facebook and instagram like 2 years ago, and my dp/dr gets triggered whenever I still see people posting on social media.

It's like they're so hooked in to the lies it's selling and I'm aware; but it's useless to make them see it?
