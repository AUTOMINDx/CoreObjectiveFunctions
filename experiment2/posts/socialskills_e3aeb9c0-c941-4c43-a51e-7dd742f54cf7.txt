How do I avoid getting interrupted and explain things in a way that people can understand before they tune out?
During the beginning of the COVID crisis in the US, I did everything virtual.  I got used to explaining things like I would in a text or an email, rather than in a way that saves speaking time.  I've found that after adapting this habit, I tend to get interrupted more.

For example: Would it be possible for me to move from A to B, and would you be able to help by sending me some work/resources from B in advance to make the transition more seamless.

Is a request that would and has gotten me interrupted.  Currently I've resolved this by only using email to make most requests that require a further explanation than "I would like to reach this goal." however, I would much rather be able to make simple requests (like getting preparation to move from A to B) in person.  This is not only a problem in my professional life, but my social life as well.  Using the same example or similar, how would you make a request without boring someone or getting interrupted?
