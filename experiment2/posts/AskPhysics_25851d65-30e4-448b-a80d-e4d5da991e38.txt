By what fraction does the pitch increase when filling a container with water?
Allow me to be more precise. We are all hopefully familiar with the rising pitch heard when filling a tall glass (or bottle) to the top with water. As pointed out in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/fjwtgz/when_you_fill_an_opentop_container_with_water_you/) from 2 yrs ago and a couple relevant stackexchange posts ([1](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/300155/why-is-the-sound-of-filling-a-container-with-liquid-always-the-same-regardless-o) [2](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/92318/why-does-a-container-with-fluid-make-different-sounds-at-different-fluid-levels)), there are two situations to consider. In the case of a necked bottle, the system is most likely best-modeled as a [Helmholtz resonator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance), however the tall glass is probably best-modeled as the classic capped pipe standing wave scenario that begins most elementary acoustics lectures. In either case, the pitch made by the water being poured in steadily rises in a predictable fashion. I am interested in the ratio of the initial frequency to the final frequency in the series of pitches so produced.

Considering the simpler standing wave model, we can (to within some constant) state that f = v/L, where f is the frequency of the pitch, v is the speed of sound through the air, and L is the distance from the water surface to the top of the glass Therefore we can say f\_2/f\_1 = L\_1/L\_2. Thus the change in frequency is inversely proportional to the amount filled with water. If we were to fill a glass 95% of the way, we expect the fundamental pitch to increase by a factor of 20.

Here is where I call upon musically inclined individuals. If the pitch goes up by a factor of 20, we can round down and conservatively call that 4 octaves (4 doublings of frequency). Intuitively, I don't hear 4 octaves. I hear more like 2. I have not been able to get a tuner to confirm this experimentally, because of the fluctuations in pitch and also the volume threshold of my tuner. Can anyone shed some light on this? Are there limiting factors I had not considered? Is there a good reason for the theoretical prediction to be off to this degree?
