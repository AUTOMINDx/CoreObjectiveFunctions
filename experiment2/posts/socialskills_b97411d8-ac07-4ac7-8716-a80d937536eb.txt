How to talk to a girl you asked out, as a friend?
This is gonna be a bit long so sorry about that. It's my first post here as well after lurking for ages lol. 

A little background first. Since I was a teen (now am 22M) I always feel hesitant to approach girls the first time and initiate conversation that flows freely. I always wait for a sort of "approval" by their side like a common "Hi" or "How you doing" on their side to show me I won't be a bother to them and to get on to it. This type of social anxiety always stood in my way to meet new friends but mostly of the female side. 

Anyway, I met this girl at work (18F) and she started talking to me and I talked back and eventually we had instances we sat at the break room together and just talked about each other and got to know each other. 
Sure, there were a bit if awkward silences but I felt it went well. 

Anyway, after a few times of this and just some banter and joking around about work and such I felt that I really liked her and asked her out. She said she isn't looking for a relationship but would love to stay friends and that's okay with me since she's cool and cute and very friendly. 

However, since then I became hesitant about approaching her. Our talks reduced to simple "Hi! How're you doing and how's your shift today" and etc etc or just to plain "ignoring" one another. 


Anyway, now, I sit here and on one hand want to really befriend her and be friends outside of work, but am hesitant due to the rejection, and my insecurity and anxiety about approaching (thinking I'm a bother) isn't helping.
