What do you tell people when they ask what you do for work?
I've been asked a few times when I actually go out if I'm working/where I work and I never know what to say. Once I just lied and said I was working at my most recent job because I was too embarrassed to say I'm not working. Other times I've said I'm not working and hope they don't ask why or anything else relating to work and change the subject.
