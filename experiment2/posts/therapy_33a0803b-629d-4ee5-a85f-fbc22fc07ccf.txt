How do I find a therapist/psychologist to talk to?
For a very long time I've been having trouble with anxiety and depression and just didn't know how to get better. I'm 34 and right now it's worse than it's ever been. If I didn't have to work I would stay home and not even come near people. And I keep on having very negative thoughts about my self and how people see me.
I just want to get better. Could someone point me in the right direction? Like do I have to schedule a doctors appointment and tell them what's going on in my head and see if they will give me a referral or something?
