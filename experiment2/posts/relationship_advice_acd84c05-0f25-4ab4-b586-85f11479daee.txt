I’m at my wits end with my husband and scared divorce is the only option.
Me and my husband have been together two years and have a three month old son. He is the light of our life and through our entire relationship before you to my son being born everything was amazing. He was my better half ,my best friend ,my world. Ever since the first day we had returned home with our son we have become almost strangers to each other. We fight extremely bad almost every 4 days to a week. He’s immediately just an asshole to me every time. I can never get any thoughts or words out without him interrupting or yelling at me. I’ve finally given up on trying to say what I have to say. Recently I have been struggling with sever anxiety and depression and this has not helped us it made everything worse. My husband has been drinking a lot more which usually leads to more fights. 99% of the time he is drunk which Escalades everything extremely quickly. My husband has been belittling me on everything. He has extremely bad anger issues and is flat out violent(due to his childhood). Whenever we fight he says things no one should even say while mad. At this point we have both tried everything to understand one another and to try and stop fighting. At this point I’m more miserable then ever. I’m so scared to leave my darling though any advice or thoughts on what I should try or do? Im at my wits end and just need help..
