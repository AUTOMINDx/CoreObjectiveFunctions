Can you work in a dead end job for the rest of the life?
I'm 20 yo. I have a diagnosed mild social phobia. Moreover I can't stand to live with my family since a long time ago. I live in Europe if that matters.

I've just started 3 years of computer science studies but I am not doing well at all except in the programming course. What should I do since I can't succeed a degree? Can you work in a grocery store or a supermarket for the rest of your life?
