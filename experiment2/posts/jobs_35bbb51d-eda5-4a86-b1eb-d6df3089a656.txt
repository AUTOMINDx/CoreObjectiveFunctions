just found out my old job at won't let me back because the FORMER manager did not give them my resignation when I quit 6 months ago.
. somebody needs to figure something out. 

something needs to be done about terrible management. He doesn't even work there anymore. I gave him that letter. 


I actually liked that job but I left because of said *former manager*, I told him my friend was killed and his exact words were "you'll get over it"  I wrote a resignation and left a few hours later. 

I just don't understand.
