Being an Indian man sucks
1) our physical genetics are awful due to my dumb ancestors choices and thousands of years of them eating a shitty low protein diet so I am basically bound to have lower muscle masses than other ethnicities even when gyming since if they gym they will be more muscular and physically superior 

2) we are usually creepy af and have unhealthy food 

3) we donâ€™t advocate mental health abs have backward traditions
