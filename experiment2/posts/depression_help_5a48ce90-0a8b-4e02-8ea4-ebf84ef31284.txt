I was told to write my depression problems here
So i have a problem with my depression, it started  more than a year ago, i thought it was lazyness, but as it developed further, it came out to be a full depression, i didnt knew it was it until i was struck by panic attack, then i immediatly visited psychiatrist, and they gave me pills to drink til the month ends, and i keep drinking them and they dont help me at all, i feel mentally sick and exhausted, i hate myself and i see no future in my life, i cant do things i do usually, i cant eat normally, i just want this to end so much, i'll do anything about it. I dont know how you can help me, but i know i cant help myself, and im struggling to do anything in my life, i stopped going to university i study in, and the studies i missed and all my household chores just keep on piling on me and i dont know how do i get out of it. Im too afraid to do anything, help. Words are not helping me, i feel nothing.
