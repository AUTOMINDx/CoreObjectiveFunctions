I hate seasonal work and I want a career job.
So three years ago I was completely unemployed and found a laborer groundskeeper type job, fast forward to today and 3-4 different seasonal employers I work in horticulture. I only take these seasonal jobs to keep myself employed and once my season gets close to the end I end up grabbing any seasonal job in this field I can get. I am looking at getting out of this field as well and using my skills for something transferable.

Thing is I have a lot of skills and still can't quite find a full time job with benefits. I have realized I'm burning out of it and working outside and traveling around all day and would much rather like a fixed worksite. Thing is no matter what I apply to I never hear back from anything but seasonal roles and it pisses me off because I want a full time job. I need to start my damn life. Any idea how to make myself marketable for career work?
