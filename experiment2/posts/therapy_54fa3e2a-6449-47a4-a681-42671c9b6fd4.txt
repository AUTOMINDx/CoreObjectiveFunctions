I became the villain
Hi i'm 17 yo i have been bullied by my classmates for years now . I was bullied cuz they thought i'am too much i'm getting so much attention that i don't deserve nothing.  Since years now the same classmates are still bullying me . But i made a decision that i'm not gonna take it anymore.  So i started defending myself first of all the main bullyi asked me years now to go on a date with him i refused so he started bullying me like those American series , the difference that is was real so real a daily torture.  Not physically but emotionally.  So i started flirting with him he appreciated and became less and less annoying.  The girl that destroyed my life i started some research and i discovered that she may be not that strong ... i started laughing and creating some surnames and laughing at her with my friends. She failed a class because of me i told the teacher she was annoying and bullied us and also she cheated and doesn't do her homework witch is true.  I saw her crying twice or more i felt happy but guilty . She caused a lot of things i have to deal with it now . Like anxiety chronic stress disorder panic attacks and dysbiose disorder ( constipation and diarrhea) those things were the cause i started defending myself.  But it doesn't work i don't fell nothing just guilt and i didnâ€™t do too much but i feel disgusted of myself.  

Please help .
