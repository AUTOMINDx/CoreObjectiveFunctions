Been feeling really dizzy and spaced out the last few hours. Stress reaction?
20M. Struggles badly with anxiety, particularly OCD. I can’t sleep currently because I’ve suddenly been dizzy, also surrounding around me feel pretty weird and like the world “feels” different, guess that’s what you could derealization. I think I’m having some sort of stress reaction, and I think I need professional help. I’m balancing too many things in my life currently in Uni, work, taking my drivers license, having a social life etc. plus I’m battling bad anxiety everyday.
