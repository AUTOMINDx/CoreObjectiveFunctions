Who was a better military commander between Hitler and Stalin?
Just like the title says, I'm wondering who was a better military commander between Hitler and Stalin. I'm watching World War II In Color and it has me thinking about this. It feels like Stalin just had so many soldiers at his disposal that he could just throw them at most situations and win with overwhelming numbers alone. But was there actually any strategy behind this? And Hitler had the Blitzkrieg but other than attacking swiftly and catching everyone off guard was there more behind it? I feel like both had their flaws whether it was a lot of casualties on Stalin's part or stretched supply lines which caused a lot of issues all around for Hitler.
