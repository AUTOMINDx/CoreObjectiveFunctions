Move in with brothers or by myself and son?
My sons mom and I recently divorced and we have a 1 year old son whom we love dearly. Her and i co parent so well too. Im currently living with my parents till i can save up for a place, however heres the issue. Should i get a 2 bedroom place for my son and i? Or look into finding a 4 bedroom place with my brothers? The idea of living with my brothers seems like a good idea, however since cost of living is so high id be paying the same in a 4 bedroom place just as if i were in a 2 bedroom with my son and i. Just not sure if i feel like always having people around if that makes sense. Not to mention, id like to live as close as possible to my sons mom since we are 50/50 custody. If i were with my brothers, id have to consider moving farther because of their jobs and what not. Idk, what are your thoughts?
