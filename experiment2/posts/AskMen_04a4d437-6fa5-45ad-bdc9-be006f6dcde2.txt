When was the first time you were directly told to treat women/girls differently?
I remember my sister who is 4 years older than me and was like twice my size at the time, shoving me and me falling down. Then i got up and pushed her and my parents flipped out and made it abundantly clear that hitting girls is unacceptable even if they hit you first. With sexism being a learned behavior, I wonder how much this affected my view of girls then onward.
