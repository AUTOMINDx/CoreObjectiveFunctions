My nParents don't know who I am
I (32/M) have been struggling for a long time with this, but recently I've finally come to accept: 

My nParents don't know who I am. 

It seems to be mostly related to me not filling their expectations for how one should lead their life, which largely means doing things in the exact form or fashion that they did. My brother seems to meet this criteria, but me? Made the decisions that would make me happy, not those that would humor them. Married a woman who is MORE than happy to call out bullshit when she sees it (a no-no,  uncomfortable matters should be ignored!). Moved out of state, to a city that is not Jewish at all, which is a cardinal sin where I come from.

These are examples, but you get the idea - this has been happening my whole life. Birthday / holiday gifts are usually a) winter gloves (of which I have too many) or b) gift cards to chain restaurants (which I hate). I've told them both about my disdain for these gifts multiple times, but getting me something else would involve knowing what I like. I've had the same group of friends forever and they still don't know their names, despite meeting them many times. When I do discuss things I enjoy, my interests get dismissed as silly, or dangerous, or your favorite dismissive statement. 

It's not just that they don't know me that bothers me - it's how clear it is that they don't care. I could write a literal book of examples. 

Logically I know this is not my fault, but it is still difficult to process. 

Thank you for reading my rant.
