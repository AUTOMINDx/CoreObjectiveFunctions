Are there restaurant kitchens where sh*t like this actually never happens?
So about a week ago, our new GM was fired because one of the waitresses told the owner the GM had slapped her ass. They watched the cameras and it was true, and he had also done some other inappropriate things with a couple other girls in the FOH (putting his hands on their waists, coming up behind them and getting up against them etc.) so he was canned on the spot. 

However, it just occurred to me, talking to my gf about it, that nobody in the kitchen *including me* had even *thought* to mention to anyone at any point that he'd also been noogie punching us all in the butthole every time he'd seen us bending down for the whole time he'd been there. Fucked up stuff like that is just so commonplace in every kitchen I've ever worked in that you don't even think of mentioning it at all. 

My gf was like "you shouldn't just have to be subjected to stuff like that, it's not okay" and I was thinking what a novel idea lol. I never considered that. That's how common it is. Is that generally how it is pretty much everywhere in restaurants, or are there kitchens where that would be considered as horrifying as it obviously would be in some other business?
