Having Dark And Disturbing Thoughts
TLDR:Title
They just suddenly appeared,I live with my grandparents and Whenever I Stare at them or anyone that's weaker than me I just think of Ways to kill them.Focusing on something else seems to work temporarily but when my mind goes blank its all i can think about.To the point where i purposefully distance myself from them to prevent causing any potential harm.I do not want to keep having these thoughts.My Grandparents are very good to me and i see no reason why the thoughts keep lingering.I am too afraid to ask them to take me to a therapist because they think im doing very fine mentally and what they will think of me afterwards,And knowing them its very likely it wont be too good.Please help me find a way to stop these  thoughts.

I also apologize if i am using an incorrect format for this type of post

Update:It doesnt affect me that much anymore but it still strikes when they're very vulnerable e.g sleeping.
