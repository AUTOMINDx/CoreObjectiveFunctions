The death of God: In need of references
Hello there. So, I've been thinking on the geneology of God, under Nietzsche's framework, and could use references to develop my view. Any good secondary sources come to mind that could help? By secondary, I mean that I am not looking for those who are involved in theorizing about God and contributed to its development, but rather those who treated it as a concept and backtracked to see how it had changed. Papers, essays, books, videos, modern, not modern... Interested in anything. 

Details: I am currently working on the view that science appeared, and there was a philosophical work to pave the road for it to progress, and in that process  God was killed (in Nietzschean terms). We'd consider Descartes the first to "stab" God. As you see, there is no reference to the role of the social and political in this so if there are works which included that it would be great (the paper of the French Revolution in the killing of God is particularly interesting to me. If there is work on this specific thing, finding it would be the greatest Christmas gift). And works that go against this theory (killing of God first, then science, for exemple, or all together against the framework of having killed God) would be greatly appreciated too. Of course any thoughts are also welcomed. 

Thanks!
