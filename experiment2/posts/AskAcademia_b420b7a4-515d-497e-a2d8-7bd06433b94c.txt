Research Psychology PhD Fast track
Hi all,  


I'm new here so I hope this is the right place to post. I am currently an M.A1 student in research psychology and my supervisor is telling me he would like me to fast-track my project to PhD. I have a few questions and concerns.  


Let me start by saying that I've been with him and at my lab for 5 years (undergrad, and MA1) and he and I have a great relationship. I do not intend to stay in academia and would like to go into industry after graduating.  


I guess first and foremost, what did your guys' timeline look like for you who fast-tracked? I know it is heavily variable from person to person, but how many years of PhD did you guys do do after you fast tracked? Did you feel like it was the right decision for you? Finally, a concern of mine that I have heard from others and would like your opinion, do you think you are overqualified for most positions because you have a PhD?
