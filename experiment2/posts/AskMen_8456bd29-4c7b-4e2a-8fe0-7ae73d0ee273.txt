How do your handle your wife when she constantly keeps shoving her phone in your face to watch things.... when you really don't want to.
Wondering how the majority of men feel with this.   My wife is constantly putting her phone in my face to watch pointless videos.   Or asking me questions about her ohone videos while she is watching when I'm clearly reading an article or doing literally anything else.   It's turned into me resenting everything my wife mentions her phone, and my wife questioning our life together if I don't care about the same things she does.    I will concede that some of the videos are hysterical, but most of them are not, especially the soul searching, depressing or eccentiric ones.   I don't want to watch countless pointless videos when I have a thousand other things to do... ( we are currently remodeling our kitchen, ourselves).  When I do watch tiktok... (once a week maybe) it's for fun...  skiing, music, etc....   not to question my existence or where the world stands politically....      'long breath out'   how should I handle this?  The "I don't fucking care about those videos" doesnt work, it just ends up with more questioning our life together if I don't care about the same things... believe me, I tried that one...
