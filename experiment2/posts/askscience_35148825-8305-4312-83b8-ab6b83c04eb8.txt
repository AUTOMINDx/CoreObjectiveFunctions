Could you theorticly make an modern LCD TV screen that work only in black and white?
For everyone wondering, I'm writing a story and I want it to be possiable in universe to buy a b/w TV set in modern times, but I still want to make it realistic in the terms of science, so I need to choose if they simply still make CRT TVs, or just have a b/w LCD screen option, so, is a b/w LCD TV could be a thing?
