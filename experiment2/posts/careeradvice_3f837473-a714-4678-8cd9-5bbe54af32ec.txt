PA, MD or APRN
I am stuck in between choosing from the three above healthcare Careers. Please if anyone has insight on this help me make a decision.
Consider: 
1. Career burnout
2. Pay 
3. Flexibility 
4. General well-being 


My interests are in the area of oncology or woman’s health but I’m open to suggestions that I can consider.
