Changed my Name
This is a throw away account, but I got married this summer and finally was able to change my name!

I was adopted by my nparents (both are narcs, it's been a wild ride) when I was 22 months old.  I already had a name, but they changed it when I was adopted.  

I have always looked forward to changing my last name, but once I got married, I thought about changing my middle name to the name I was given at birth.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it once I had actually done it.  

Well, I did it, and it feels great!!  Just wanted to share.
