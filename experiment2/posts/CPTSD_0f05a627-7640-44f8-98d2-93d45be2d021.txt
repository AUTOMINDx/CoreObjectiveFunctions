DAE feel the need to isolate themselves from people when you start caring about them too much?
I ruin my (almost) every romantic or friendly relationship over minor things or my own insecurities when I start caring too much about the person. I get anxious they don't like me like I like them, that they actually hate me, that I'm going to hurt them in the long run, or that they're actually bored with me and just don't want to tell me that lol  


Does anyone else have that? I feel like it might have to do with my emotionally absent parents lol
