The only thing I look forward to everyday is eating and jerking off
I’m a freshman is college. My high school girlfriend broke up with me at the start of the semester. My old friend group split up. I used to look forward to spending time with them and my girlfriend on the weekends, but now I have nothing to look forward too. I’ve tried joining a few clubs, but I haven’t really made any new friends yet. I never have any plans. I don’t do anything. I just sit in my dorm all day and study. The weekends don’t make me happy anymore. Life just feels like one constant blur. Everything is the same. I used to enjoy gaming and watching TV but I don’t anymore. The only thing I still enjoy is making music, but one hobby isn’t enough to make me happy. I miss the social and love life I used to have. Everything just feels so boring and uneventful now.
