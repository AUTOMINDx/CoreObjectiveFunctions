25F Road Rash infected?
Hi! I took a bad fall five days ago. I’d been covering it with non stick gauze and neosporin but I used tegaderm tonight and it’s really pointing out these white spots. Is it infected? Should I be worried? It doesn’t hurt to the touch anymore but it burns a little occasionally. Also it wasn’t bleeding or oozing anything but now there’s a bit of brown discharge with the Tegaderm, is that normal? Thank you!
