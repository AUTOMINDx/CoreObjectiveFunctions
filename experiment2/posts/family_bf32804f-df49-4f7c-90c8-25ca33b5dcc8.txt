Issues with sister visiting
Hi- my fianc√© and I just purchased a cabin in Lake Tahoe area and remodeled as it was quite dated. We put a lot of energy and tLC into the remodel
And feel great about the results. it is certainly not fancy but we love what we did and are happy to have a very comfortable vacation home. FAst forward. My sister has a dog that sheds a lots and is  untrained (pees On carpet.) My beau is allergic to shedding dogs And we do t want a Bunch of dog hair or pee on our new carpets. My sister adores her dog and want to come for 2 weeks. After a thanksgiving fiasco where her dog wreaked havoc on our house we have decided we do not want the dog  coming to our cabin. I am nervous to tell my sister this as her dog is literally her everything and I worry her feelings will be hurt. Please let me know how I can communicate this to her gently. I adore her and dont want to cause a rift
