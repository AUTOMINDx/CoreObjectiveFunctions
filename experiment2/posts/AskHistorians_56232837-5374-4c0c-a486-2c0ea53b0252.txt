Intellectual History of the term "Cultural Appropriation"
Where did the term cultural appropriation actually come from? I'm trying to figure this out and for the life of me can't find a straight answer.

In [this Oxford Reference article](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095652789), no single point of origin is mentioned, in fact, it is striking how ***none*** of the cited authors actually use the term being defined in the reference article:

* Concerning Kenneth Coutts‐Smith, "he himself does not \[use\] the phrase ‘cultural appropriation.'"
* New Negro and Harlem Renaissance writers wrote about the issue, "though not in these terms."
* Michael North is cited as "One of the finest discussions of these issues," but, \[can you guess what comes next?\] he "does not use the term ‘cultural appropriation’."

So, what's the deal? Where exactly did this specific term come from? Was it something that emerged first in public discourse, and was only thereafter taken up (appropriated?) by academics? Or is there an intellectual history that this reference article is, in fact, missing?
