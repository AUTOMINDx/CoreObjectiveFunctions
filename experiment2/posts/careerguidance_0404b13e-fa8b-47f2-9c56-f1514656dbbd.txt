I’m not sure if I have the correct experience?
Hello all, so I (23M) am just unsure if I’m qualified for a certain type job. I went to a small university of around 10k. I majored in political science and minored in economics but I’m not looking for employment in those fields. I was an officer on a recreational sports student council that organized and carried out athletic and recreational events on campus for four years. I played a very active role and was even the President of the council for my senior year. I would like to continue my career and work an entry level job at an athletics department somewhere (I’m from close to Philly so their are tons of uni’s nearby). I would just like to hear from other people, am I qualified for such a job? And what other jobs would I have a chance at given my past experience? Any advice really does help an awful lot! Thanks for reading!
