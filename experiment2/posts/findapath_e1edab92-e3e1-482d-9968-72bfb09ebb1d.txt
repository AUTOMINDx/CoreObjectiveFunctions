An increasingly strange feeling growing with time
Been increasingly going through this feeling that there is something not right

A constant anxiety/dread/unhappiness/ zipping through days/ filling days with power point presentations on mindless things, lot of regret, reminiscence bygone days, jumping into/out of fleeting -superficial relationships (for unmarried ones), not finding interest in routine work, feeling stuck, in the same-loop day in day-out.

Anyone else feeling the same? is this mid-life crisis/depression? What is the way out?
