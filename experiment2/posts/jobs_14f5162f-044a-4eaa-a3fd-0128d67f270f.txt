Can we just make it socially acceptable to ask for salary in the first interview?
Everyone has a minimum in mind when applying for jobs, and it just saves everyone time in applications. Not asking for salary right off the back seems to be equivalent to not discussing your salary with coworkers - either way the company benefits. And it seems there's a growing number of people who are frustrated with job listings not including the salary range.

Edit - thanks for the award!
