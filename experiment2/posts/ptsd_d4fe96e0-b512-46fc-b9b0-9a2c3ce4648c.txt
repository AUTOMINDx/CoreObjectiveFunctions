Physically violent in my sleep
As the title says I’m often physically violent in my sleep usually when I’ve had nightmares/night terrors as my body doesn’t seem to do the usual paralysis thing when I’m unconscious this has led to me hitting my partner numerous times while asleep and I feel pretty bad about it. I’m wondering if anyone else experiences this and if so if they’ve found any effective ways to either reduce or stop this from happening because I obviously want to keep my partner safe when I have these episodes.
