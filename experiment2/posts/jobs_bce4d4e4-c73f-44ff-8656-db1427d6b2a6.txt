Advice on being hired at lower title and pay than appropriate for experience and credentials
Hi Reddit,

An issue has come to my attention regarding my job of one year. I was hired on after receiving my masters degree and have been working for 1 year here. I was hired on at 40k salary with the basic job title, which I tried to negotiate to 50k unsuccessfully.

We are now hiring a new person to the team. They could either be hired on at the basic title or senior title. The senior title requires a masters degree and would be paid 50k minimum. The job tasks would be the same either way.

My issue: I qualify for the senior title as I have the related job experience and a masters degree. I’m not sure why I wasn’t hired on at this level to begin with but would like to obtain this status so that I can be paid at the level I deserve. How do I deal with this? Do I contact my boss, HR, or another individual? 

Thanks for the help!
