If you experienced your current life in a continuous loop, what's one thing you would change to improve it?
Hey there,  


I know this is a tough question. But I think it holds great potential to become aware of the things that we adapted to, but aren't really satisfied with.  
Perhaps you've heard about the "Boiling Frog Syndrome": If a frog is suddenly put into a pot of boiling water, it will jump out immediately. If the frog, however, is put in lukewarm water with the temperature gradually rising, it won't perceive any danger to itself and therefore also won't jump out. The bottom line is: We sometimes adapt to deterioration without noticing it. Be it a job that uses up our energy, toxic relationships we maintain in our lives or even accumulating clutter in our apartment.  


So this is meant as an encouragement to change these things - which of course starts by becoming aware of them. I also like this thought experiment as a journaling exercise - so if you want to go a little deeper, you may even be able to identify what's really important to you in life and what your values are.  


Curious to hear what your answers are and I hope this was helpful for someone!
