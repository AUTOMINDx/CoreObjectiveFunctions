Was off medication for 4 days, didn't sleep 2 nights in a row. Can't function and freaking out.
I'm on Paxil CR 25 mg and I finally got back on it.  I took my first dose in 4 days earlier this morning.  It's shortly after 2pm as I type this.  Going without it for 4 days is partly my fault because I dragged my butt with requesting a refill.  And my first 2 fills of the prescription were for 14 days at a time.  I had to call and tell them I needed 30 days at a time instead of 14.  Because my prescriber wouldn't do his job right.  

Now I'm freaking out about when I'm going to get real sleep again.  I didn't sleep or MAYBE half-slept for 2 nights in a row and I can't function on that.  

I really need at some reassurance that I will start sleeping normally again.  Maybe that sleep problem was withdrawal symptom; could it be? 

Help!
