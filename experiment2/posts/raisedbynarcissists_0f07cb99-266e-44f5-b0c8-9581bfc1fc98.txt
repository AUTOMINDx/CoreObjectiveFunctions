A list of things my beloved mother🥰 has said to me
● A saying in my language which goes something like           this "you can't make a horse out of a donkey, no matter how much you beat it"
● Another rough translation being that, she has no attachment to me and me being dead or alive makes no difference to her.
●She wants to see me fail in life ( Yes I know that no ones going to believe me on this, but idk...)
●She also states that a puppy "kutte ka bacha" would be able to learn stuff faster than me.

I had nobody to talk to about this weird mental list I've made of the stuff she says so I posted it on here haha            I have no idea what goes on anymore, I'm just holding on for dear life. 😅
