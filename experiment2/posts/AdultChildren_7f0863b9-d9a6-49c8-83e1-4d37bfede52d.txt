Need help setting boundaries
So my mother is a retired psychotherapist and a former alcoholic. She has been sober from alcohol and going to AA meetings (at least that’s what she tells me when she’s sober). However, she has been in denial for her pill problem for a long time. The reason why I mentioned her psychotherapy background is because I know that has helped with how good she lies.

Anyway, I’ve been getting voicemails from her sounding high as hell over the phone. I want to set a boundary with her in only calling me when she’s sober. But how can I do that if she’s in denial of her problem? She’s only going to get defensive when she’s sober, and she’s not even going to remember if I tell her when she’s high. 

I’m just so tired of the emotional roller coaster from talking to the sober supermom and then the bitterness from talking to her high-self. I want to have a better relationship with her where I actually want to call her/answer the phone without feeling like I have to risk talking to her pill problem.

Any tips to give  would be cool. Thank you for the read anyway :)
