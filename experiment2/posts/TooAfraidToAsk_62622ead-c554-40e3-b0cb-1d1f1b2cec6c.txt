Why is insulin so expensive in U.S.A?
I have read about the insulin prices in states and how people ration there insulin, I just came from trip to a third world country and insulin is free for most people in government hospitals and really cheap if you want to buy from outside, why doesnâ€™t people order there insulin from outside United States or other companies order from outside and sell in there pharmacies and stores instead of buying the expensive one?
