Is proton decay more or less accepted or decidedly not going to happen?
I've seen videos about iron stars that suggest proton decay will not occur, but at the same time I believed it was only natural for all things to "decay" as entropy increases.  What is the currect mindset held by the scientific community... will we get mass stockpiles of unfusable iron or a world without stars?
