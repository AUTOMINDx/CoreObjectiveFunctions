How often does your university allow (if they ever allow at all) the taking of undergraduate courses during your grad school progression (MS or PhD)?
In my university in the country (Philippines) this has always been the practice. Is it there same in other countries like US, UK, etc.? Also if ever you want extra courses outside your program how often are people permitted to take them? Can they(admin ,PI, etc.) disapprove your move or this is something they cannot question as long as you have the resources to pay?
