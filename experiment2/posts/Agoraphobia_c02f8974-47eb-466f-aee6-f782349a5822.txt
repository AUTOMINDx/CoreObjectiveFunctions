My dog has been sick and I think I’m sliding back into bad times
I’ve been doing semi-okay with my agoraphobia. I managed to hold down a full-time job for five months that had 10-11 hour shifts. It was truly terrible, and I was throwing up before work and crying in my car on the way there and back. I kept going because finding a new job is difficult and it was paying enough for me to pay for my dog’s medicine/vet visits as he gets older. He’s my #1 motivator to try and take care of myself and be a part of society. 

Unfortunately, I got fired, and my dog had a stroke a couple of days later. I was able to get him into the emergency vet where he’s apparently doing much better. They’ve been busy and I haven’t been able to see him. Hopefully I can today, but getting motivated to get down there and waiting for their call all day has me in a complete panic. I keep thinking of all the worse scenarios, and I feel like I’m back at square one. I can’t even take the trash out, and I hate backsliding. 

I feel like I just can’t function without him, but I should be the one there for him right now. I keep panicking about how if something happens I don’t know how I will deal with it. I can’t stop crying. I just want him to come home so I can kiss his little face and tell him he’s the best.
