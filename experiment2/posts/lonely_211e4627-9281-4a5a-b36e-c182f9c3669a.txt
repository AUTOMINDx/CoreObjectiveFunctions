Where does one go to make friends?
Honestly, i don't have a huge anxiety issue with people. I can be sensitive to other people being cold but i don't mind being around people. I'm quite hefty and physically intimidating, and i notice how other people shy before me. 

All i need is a location. I have very few hobbies or interests but i am willing to go anywhere or try anything. I'm really desperate for a friend after the fuckup that was my teenage angst and trauma.
