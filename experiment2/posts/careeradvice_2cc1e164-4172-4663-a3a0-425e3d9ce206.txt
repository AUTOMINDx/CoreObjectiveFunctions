Careers after journalism?
I graduated this year with a BA in Journalism and Mass Communication. For nearly the last three months, I've been working for the city newspaper. I have nearly 30 bylines so far.

As interesting as my job is, it doesn't pay that much. I'm thinking of switching careers to something that pays much better.

But I'm not sure what kind of jobs I'd be suited for considering my experience. What kind of jobs can one switch to from journalism that pays well?

And while this is not as much of a consideration compared to pay, I was hoping to switch to something that would give me personal satisfaction as well, where I would be motivated to work and would feel like what I'm doing matters in some way.

I'd really appreciate any advice I could get.
