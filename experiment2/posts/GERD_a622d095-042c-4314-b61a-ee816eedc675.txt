I have had severe gerd all my life, can't stay on PPI's. Need help...
So, I figured out what a lot of my health problems are. I had severe GERD at around 13 years of age and they started me on Nexium. I have been on it for 16 years and slowly my life has been declining due to it. I developed food intolerances, issues digesting, Severe GAS, severe heart palpitations, Intolerable abdominal pain, Calcium, Magnesium, and Vitamin D deficiency, and the worst overactive kidneys in the world (SEVERE nocturia up to 9x a night or so). I mean, these issues got to the point where they are effecting my life and work. They are also finding that Nexium causes heart disease, kidney disease, increased risks of cancer etc. I have been from doctor to doctor and not one person not even a gastro specialist has been any help at all. No one wanted to look further into my issue. It was just, " Stay on the Nexium".  Well, I decided to try and wean myself off of Nexium and all these issues have gone away. The downside, I have uncontrollable heartburn 24/7 now. It turns out I do have a hiatal hernia but they won't do anything about it (It's not that I have too much acid, which is why I was having so many digestive issues on the Nexium, but it's that I can't keep it down. In fact antacids make it worse) the surgeon claims that hiatal hernia repairs have a 30% chance for serious complications and in most people come back after roughly 7 years. I cannot stay on the meds due to the other side effects but how can I get off them if they won't fix the issue? What on Earth can I do? I don't have money to keep going from doc to doc...
