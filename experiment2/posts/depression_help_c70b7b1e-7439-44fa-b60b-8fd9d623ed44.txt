I have a depressed dad. What activities can be useful to support him?
I live away from my parent's house, but every december I go to visit them and spend Christmas and New Year.  

At this moment my father is going through an episode of depression (mostly feeling sad and not in the mood to do common things), that he has suffered throughout his life.

I want to create a list of activities that I can do with him to cheer him up. He likes riding a bike, going to the sea, eating in restaurants and walking. 

What other activities do you recommend?

I want to point out that he receives professional help and medication, but sometimes that has no effect in his mood.
