Travel anxiety / fear of being far from home. Experience? Advice?
Does anyone know the fear while travelling? 
I have extreme anxiety when we want to go on vacation. That's why I haven't been flying for 10 years. 
The situation makes me extremely sad, I want to be free and travel - and gladly alone too. But I have so much anxiety before and during the trip that I can't enjoy it at all. I often canceled plans shortly before the trip. 
I have done various therapies now, also tried hypnosis, also taken hospital stays on me but I just do not get it under control and I have the feeling my life passes by me and I miss so much. 
Makes me really sad. Really depressed, my life doesn't feel fulfilled - more limited as I'm missing out on so much. 
It's really frustrating and I would like to understand it better. Are there people here who are experiencing it similarly? 
How have you guys been able to get a handle on it? 
I've been further away from home in the past few years but unfortunately it's been so exhausting, I'm just not me then. I can't enjoy it because of fear and stress in my head. It frustrates me incredibly. 
I am so minimized in my private and professional life. My relationship suffers. 
The feeling of being far away from home, my safe place - is the main feeling which lies underneath.
