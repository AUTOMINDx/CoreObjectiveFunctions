Got diagnosed with high functioning bipolar disorder in the middle of moving to a new city, getting a puppy and starting a new high 6 figure job that I realized I donâ€™t care for at all. Could use some general insight (also career insight) and hope. All of these changes over the past few weeks. 28F.
