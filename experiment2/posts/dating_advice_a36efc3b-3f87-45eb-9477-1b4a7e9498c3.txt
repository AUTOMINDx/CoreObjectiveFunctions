When and how to give flowers?
So, there is a friend I like and she loves flowers, so I wanted to give them some. The problem is that I don't know whether she sees me only as a friend or something more. We have only gone out like a couple times and pretty much nothing has happened. Should I just wait till I know she's interested in me?

First, I thought to give her a bouquet, but then I realised that could be interpretated as something too serious and I don't want her to think of me as too intense or desesperated. Then, it came to me that a single flower might be better. But, I just don't know what kind of flower should I give her. A single flower would also send a strong message?

The thing is that I don't want to send any message and make her feel uncomfortable. I just want to give her a flower because I think that would make her happy. How can I let her know that and not be misinterpretated?
