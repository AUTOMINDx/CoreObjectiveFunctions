How to deal with my own thoughts
Hey guys, Im here because I honestly don't know where else to talk about this. I'm currently a 17M. I've been struggling with a bunch of depression issues, SH, which I am proudly clear of for 3 months as of now, and suicidal thoughts. I know I'm depressed. But I always think I don't deserve to be depressed. Compared to other people, I've had a pretty easy life. Went to a private middle and high school. Wasn't abused physically or anything. But as I go on, I keep feeling worse and worse. Do I deserve to feel depressed and suicidal when people out there have valid reasons to be depressed and I don't? Sure I've had things happen to me. Been cheated on, heartbroken, stress etc but nothing really bad that many associate to depression. A lot of my friends were abused and they are depressed. I see people who were SA and that's a reason to have depression and anxiety and everything. And I feel terrible because when people ask me why I'm depressed, I don't really have any good reasoning. I just, kinda am? And I'm getting worse and I don't know why. I don't have any valid reasoning to feel like this and I feel bad I don't and I claim to be depressed because others have reasoning ig. Sorry if that was a bit of a ramble, just confused a bit about shit. Thank you for your time :)
