I looked up depression on Google and it said it can cause brain damage
Just great!/s Along with all the other crap happening in the world that I simply cannot cope with, I just learned on Google that depression can cause permanent brain damage. So I guess I better stop being unhappy or soon I won't remember my ABC's or go potty by myself anymore. Whatever I've probably already got early dementia, anyway.
