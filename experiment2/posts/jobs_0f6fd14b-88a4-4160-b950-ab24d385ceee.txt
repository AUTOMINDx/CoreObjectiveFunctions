Find remote job in another coutry
I live in Spain and I'm about to finish my university degree in economics and I will love to be able to work remotely so I was thinking countries like the US, UK or Irland because the wages in Spain are really low and is hard to find a job. I will like to work on something related to my field, but I don't know what jobs I'm qualified to do abroad with my studies if any.
