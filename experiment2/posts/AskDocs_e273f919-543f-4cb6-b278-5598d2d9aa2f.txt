6 year old boy complaining of heart beating
What’s a normal heart rate for a 6 year old? His main complaint was his heart was beating fast and he’s had a cough for 2 weeks and a runny nose for like 2 months but the doctor says he’s fine and it’s just a cold. he’s healthy besides his diet, due to his sensory issues he’s very picky. His heart felt fast when he came up to tell me. I’m not sure what to do… he’s acting fine
