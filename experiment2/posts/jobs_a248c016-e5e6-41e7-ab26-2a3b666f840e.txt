People always say that you shouldn't become too friendly with your coworkers, so as to avoid mixing your personal and professional lives. But how else are people who move to new cities for work supposed to make friends and build a new social life?
I'm graduating from college soon, and I have a job offer that would have me relocating to a completely new city where I don't know anybody. Naturally the prospect of moving to a new city can be exciting, but I also want to make new friends and have people to hang out with after work and on the weekends. This company is hiring me along with an entire class of fresh-out-of-college graduates like me, and I'm obviously excited to meet them. 

But everywhere I look online, people say to keep your personal life separate from your professional life. If I took this advice after I moved to the new city, and kept *everyone* I meet from work at a professional distance, I wouldn't exactly have a personal life to keep private. 

Obviously I'm not gonna hit the bars and get shitfaced with my supervisors, but surely it's okay to hang out with and become friends with your coworkers who are your age, right?
