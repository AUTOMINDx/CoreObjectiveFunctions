I feel like I'm missing something and I don't know how to find it
Hi everyone.  I am 24 years old and about to graduate from my law degree.  I work full time in a good job and work out everyday.  I have just started learning Japanese and piano and reading a book every night before bed and with all of these activities I have been consistent.  The reason for all of this is because I have no passion and I honestly can't remember the last time I felt happy.  I am trying to expand my horizons and build healthy habits but none of it makes me any happier and I don't know what else I should try.  I see many people who don't have goals and are unhappy so I set goals but even when I am achieving them I feel empty.  Is passion real? Why do I feel no sense of happiness or accomplishment even when I am making progress.  I don't understand.
