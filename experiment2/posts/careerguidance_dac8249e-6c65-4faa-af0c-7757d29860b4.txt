Careers that I pursue with any type of Bachelor's degree?
I graduated with a Legal Studies degree and a minor in Political Science in the fall of 2018. I realized pretty quickly that I should have changed majors near the end but at that point I Just wanted to graduate and be done.

I've been working as a bartender since but have been trying to figure out if I can still manage to find a career with just a bachelor's degree?

Any help/ guidance is very appreciated.
