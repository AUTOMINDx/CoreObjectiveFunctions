The Egos masks, and how it manifests your reality
TL;DR: I originally made a comment about the ego, and I received a lot of feedback about it. Decided to turn it into a post. The 6 character concepts are from the book Mindworks by Gary van Warmerdam. The manifestation part is based off my own life experiences.


What do you think about when you hear the word ego? Some words that come to mind for me are "arrogance", "boastful", "cocky", "self-centered" and "stubborn". There's a lot more, but those are what originally popped in my head. It means something different for everyone, but it's something we all have in common. Everyone has an ego. It also has many different names. It's been called "inner child", but I like to call it my shadow. I consider it the dark side of my personality, but it is not inherently evil. So what is it exactly?

From a scientific standpoint, it's a primitive part of the brain that is focused around survival. It can't think, it has no logic, but it does play a critical part in our early development. It is directly responsible for developing our belief system. Those beliefs in turn, create our emotions. Think about a time when you were a young child. You did something bad that your parents didn't like, so they scolded you for it. You had a reaction to the scolding in the form of fear. This fear based reaction came from a belief that was developed. "If I do XYZ, I will get in trouble for it." Your body produced fear/anxiety as an uncomfortable emotional reaction so that you would remember not to do XYZ. This is how our belief system is developed as a child, but it's a lot more complex than that, and can change over time. The problem is, sometimes these beliefs can be misinterpreted, and develop irrationally (more on that later).

**Our ego isn't our authentic self**

You see it all the time on Reddit and in life. A post that starts with "I'm a loser." You tell yourself "I'm not pretty/good looking." You criticize yourself with everything you do. This isn't you talking, it's one of the 6 masks/characters of your ego. Anytime I hear someone criticize themselves like this my first reaction to them is always either "that ain't you talking" or "how dare you talk to yourself like that." Brownie points if you tell someone this as your charismatic self, there's not a better feeling out there, and it makes the other person feel great too. So...what exactly are these characters of our ego? I'm glad you asked.

**The six masks/characters of the ego**

As stated before, our ego has 6 characters/masks that it wears. Anytime you are wearing one of these masks, you are not the authentic you. These masks are:

**Judge** - has set rules and criticizes those that break them

**Victim** - takes blame for everything, especially from the judge

**Pleaser** - looking for love/affection externally (like the victim). Does acts in the hope that people will like him, instead of just giving freely

**Fixer** - aka the hero, but a false hero. Tries to "fix" things in accordance with the judges rules

**Princess** - entitled, world revolves around me mindset

**Villain** - hurt child complex. Basically the victim going on the offensive. Filled with rage/anger

Each one of these masks have their own belief system that is not part of the authentic you. For example, the Judge believes he is all knowing. He believes that whatever he says is true, the rules he sets are pure, and anyone that breaks them is not worthy. The Victim believes he is not worthy, so he automatically takes criticism from the Judge. I find that most of our emotional responses stem from a Judge and Victim interaction. Anytime you start to hear yourself take on one of these characters voices/beliefs, just take a step back and recognize that it isn't the real authentic you.

**Four words that the ego can't operate with**

One very strong method I've found for dealing with my ego is to do right action. That can mean different things for a lot of people, but to me, right action is following my values. I'm not going to list all of my values here, however I am going to give you four of the most powerful words that you should absolutely add to your values list if you don't have them. These words make it impossible for your ego to exist if you follow them. It's essentially it's kryptonite. Those words are:

**Honesty (with yourself and others)**

**Responsibility**

**Humility**

**Gratitude** 

All four of these words are very high on the energy vibration chart. What makes these words special is that they all require conscious action/thought, and remember, the ego can't think. It's behavioral/belief driven, and lives in your subconscious mind, which leads me to my last point.

**We manifest our reality with our beliefs and subconscious mind**

How do you feel about yourself? Like, truly feel about yourself? Do you believe you deserve everything you want in life? Do you even know what that is to you? The universe and everything in it will treat you exactly how you want to be treated deep down. That's why it's incredibly important to look at the belief system your Judge has created, and to shut your Victim down in its tracks. Your Judge has made a set of complex rules/beliefs over the years based on what has happened to you. If you truly believe deep down that you are not worthy (and that's one of the 3 biggest false beliefs people tell themselves), then you will subconsciously manifest and seek out situations that support this belief. How many times has a partner grown bored of you and left? How many times have you felt blown off at a job or with friends? What is the underlying feeling with all of that? Awareness, perspective, and insight will completely change your life. You just have to keep asking **why**.
