How to drive P-Channel Mosfet with RPi
So I am trying to build a relay box for automotive applications like turning on lightbars and such. But instead of using relays i've decided to go with mosfets. Specifically P-Channel as I want to design it as a high side switch to not complicate the automotive wiring and to be able to chassis ground the components that are powered by this. I think I found a suitable mosfet here [https://lcsc.com/product-detail/MOSFETs\_MATSUKI-ME85P03\_C165222.html](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/MOSFETs_MATSUKI-ME85P03_C165222.html)   

But I am still a little unsure of how to drive it from the raspberry pi's 3.3v logic level. I tried to research possible solutions but I am having trouble finding a clear solution. I understand I need to use another N channel mosfet or an NPN to drive the P channel? But what do I need to look for in terms of specs to find one that will work? How should I design the circuit to make sure I do not overload the RPi's 16mA?
