He’s driving me nuts.
I (29f) met this guy (31m) on a dating app a few months ago. We hit it off, went on some really nice dates. The third and last date was at my place, we had a nice dinner and he spent the night. He made plans for seeing me again on the weekend. 
All of the sudden, he didn’t initiate texts anymore and overall became a bit distant. I ended up asking him if our plans for the weekend still stand, he sent me a really long text that any type of relationship is currently too much for him and that it wouldn’t be fair to me to continue if he’s not fully in it. 
I did the usual overthinking but honestly, I did kind of believe him and just let it go. 

Fast forward to now, we ended up matching again and started dating again. Honestly, every time that we’ve seen each other was very nice. We still get along great and I believe he is genuinely a good person. There one major thing that make me feel uneasy though. When we see each other, he has a tendency to make “plans” for us. What we could do together, where we go on holiday etc. 
There’s nothing wrong with that but it makes me fall for him. He seems so genuine when he says those things. But in between seeing each other, he’s suddenly so different?! Via text he seems distant (responsive and polite but short texts, few questions), exactly like the time he initially dumped me. I then ask him if we want to do something that week, I fully expect him to dump me every time but (at least so far) we just end up arranging our next date. We then see each other, it’s fantastic and then we start this same cycle again…. It’s driving me mad 😭😭 what do I do?
