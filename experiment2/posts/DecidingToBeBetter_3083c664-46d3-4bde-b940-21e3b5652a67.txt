My father died and I feel guilty
My dad died over a liver cancer at 66 yrs. He drunk a lot in the past: heavy drinks, multiple times, every day, starting too soon during the day and going to sleep at around 1-2 am. He’d turn agressive when drinking and the house enviornment, already very unleathy, would turn like hell. He kept buying these drinks almost every day. I am one of the reasons, if not the main one, of why he drank so much. I hated him, we didn’t speak, and when we did we would fight verbally. Few times was physically and I remember me punching him and his glasses falling. I felt triumphant back then, and regret it so much right now. I told him multiple times I hated him, that I wished he was dead, it would make my life and my mom’s a lot easier. Today I feel the complete opposite. All I feel is guilt inside me. I love him and he did a lot to protect me, in his own particular way. I went to the best schools, I have a good curriculum, I could play tennis, an expensive sport, I had no financial problems, I never had to worry about necessary things, all thanks to him. He supported me with everything by affording all these stuff, and I just valued these during his last weeks. We were fine during the last 7 months, but this toxic relationship lasted for years, more than a decade for sure. I wish I was on time to apologize, but when I did, he wasn’t there at least consciously. I really doubt he could listen to what I said but I knew he felt my presence and maybe, I hope, at least he could recognize my voice. I mistreated him so much during my life, he wasn’t good for me either but he did what he could. How can I cope with all this guilt inside me? I want to be better but I have this feeling stuck inside me.
