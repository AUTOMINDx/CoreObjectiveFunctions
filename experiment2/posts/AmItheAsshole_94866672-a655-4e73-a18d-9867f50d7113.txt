AITA for telling a waitress to stop talking to us as if we were stupid?
I work at a Chinese company that recently began operations in Mexico. Most of the managers are Chinese, and most can only speak Mandarin, a few can also speak broken English and a couple can also speak Spanish.

I had lunch with some of the managers that don't speak anything but Chinese. Of course, this meant that they relied on me to communicate with the waitress. Of course, any attempt at direct communication with the Chinese managers fell on deaf ears. 

She still insisted on talking slowly, as if slowly repeating the same thing she just said would suddenly make them understand a language they have never studied. 

At some point, she started to talk slowly to me as well, even after listening me speak in perfect Mexican Spanish.

After they third time she talked to me like that I told her. "They don't understand a single word of Spanish and I'm Mexican. You can stop talking to us as like that and talk normally"

"Like that how" she answered, clearly upset.

"Do you speak with every customer as if they were stupid? Or only with the ones that speak another language?"

She was clearly offended, but stopped talking like that to us and the rest of lunch went perfectly. I tipped as normal and left.

I can't stop thinking that even if useless, she was still trying to be helpful. So, AITA?
