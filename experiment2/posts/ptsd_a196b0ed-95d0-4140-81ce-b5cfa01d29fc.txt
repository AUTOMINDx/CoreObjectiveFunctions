Trying to give it time to get better
Its almost a year ago i got diagnosed with ptsd. I dont wish to go into detail on what happened but itâ€™s multiple different things combined that causes me to have difficulty living with it. Im told that with time as what happened is further away it can help but on the road there i get worried about how much more time is needed before i eventually start to feel better if at all. On one side its this but the other side is the opposite of that and its a confusing conflict between the two that only makes everything worse.
