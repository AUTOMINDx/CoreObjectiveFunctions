I sometimes think I should keep a diary for the sole reason that my dumbass brain, when not feeling awful, says "aww, my parents weren't so bad, it's not that bad living here, they're not that bad" YES THEY ARE YOU STUPID ASSHOLE
Other times I feel like it's useless, since when I read my own posts I feel like I lied for the sake of attention.

One side of me: "You do recognize and remember those stories, right? You wrote them. It's you. You remember the thing you talked about. It happened. Your feelings happened. All of those words happened"

Other side of me: "UH YEAH BUT MAYBE THE... PHRASING MAKES THEM LOOK WORSE THAN THEY ARE! MY FAMILY'S NOT AS BAD AS I MADE THEM SOUND COME ON! THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I SAW IT LIKE THAT BUT IT WASN'T LIKE THAT I'M SURE"

how do you even gaslight yourself lol
