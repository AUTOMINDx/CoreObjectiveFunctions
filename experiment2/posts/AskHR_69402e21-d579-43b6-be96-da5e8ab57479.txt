[FL] When considering new job, when is the right time to disclose pregnancy?
When considering a new job, when is the best time to disclose pregnancy?

I am looking at remote jobs and am currently 19 weeks pregnant. That puts me due in April. I donâ€™t want anyone to feel duped, but I do need a better fitting job for me while I transition to being a mom.

Thank you for all advice!
