[NJ] what do equity pay raises mean? Iâ€™m getting my second one within a couple years
Company is a Fortune 500 multi-billion dollar corporation. I received an equity raise 2 or 3 years ago, and always get a merit raise every year as well. Now they just told me I am getting another equity raise as of Jan 1. Should I be reading between the lines that this means I am underpaid? Like, am I just scraping by at the bare minimum for my job grade? I have been in this job for 5 years, and my colleague has been here for about 30 years (this specific role for maybe 10) so I think that might also be a factor in the inequity?
