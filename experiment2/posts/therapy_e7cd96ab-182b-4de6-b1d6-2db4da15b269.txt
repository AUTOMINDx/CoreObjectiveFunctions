How do I get the motivation to get help?
I have been out of therapy for a very long time at this point. I ended up stopping for a few reasons. 

First is that I was only able to get sessions biweekly instead of weekly. Second is that I overall had a negative experience with the therapy. And third is that I began to feel worse and worse to the point where I was having panic attacks nearly every day. I eventually decided to stop the sessions and over time I did stop having the panic attacks. 

The problem though is that it is not a fix and I know that. However I know that I will possibly have to go through the same pain again if I want to get better, which is what has caused me to not try to get help. I know that I need to get help, but actually getting myself to do it is very difficult for me.
