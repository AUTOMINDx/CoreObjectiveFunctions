How to be a caring partner?
Tonight I made my partner feel terrible because of something carelessly said. 

Today is especially bad, because she took care of me all day when I was sick and I still selfishly criticized her for not giving more.

At first, I have all my justifications, but when I'm alone, I write out the situation, I realize the reality is as harsh as I described it above. All my excuses are just there to make me feel better about myself.

I want to believe that each time I realize this, I'm growing and improving and becoming more careful &amp; empathetic. But I can't complacently accept that answer because it's almost every day that I do or say something that is careless.

I'm asking for general advice on the internet because I just don't want to keep failing at being a good friend/partner/person all the time. Whatever I'm doing to be better, it's not good enough. I donâ€™t know if I can get help like this but I have to try because I don't want to go on like this.

If you made it this far, you have my thanks. I'm not looking for a way out of the consequences of my actions, I just want to stop hurting the people I care about.
