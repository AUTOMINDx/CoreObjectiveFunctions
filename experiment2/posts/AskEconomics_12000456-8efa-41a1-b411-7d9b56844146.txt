What happens to a loan if the bank closes?
So Iâ€™m sitting on the youtubes listening to an economics channel, and he mentions increasing interest rates and it got me thinking...

So if banks (and credit unions) make money by lending out money and charging interest, they are able to pay their bills and their employees, and make billions in revenue. 

I currently have a home loan at a fixed/locked interest rate. If the interest rates go up, mine will stay the same. If interest rates go up, people will stop borrowing money. Therefore, banks will have a reduced income.

What happens to a loan or mortgage if the bank goes out of business? Pretending they wont get bailed out. Would another bank buy them out probably? And then I would continue to make payments to that new bank? Would they jack up the interest rate cause its a new contract? What happens? 

Not concerned about this actually happening, just a hypothetical scenario that unfolded in my little brain. What do you guys think?
