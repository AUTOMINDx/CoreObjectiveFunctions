Confused on what path to choose. Need advice.
So I’m conflicted on what career I would like to take in life. I’m conflicted on either going into accounting or either heading into video game journalism. On the one hand with accounting it’s almost definitely a lot of work with something I’m okay with doing but don’t love it but also probably making a decent amount of money. Then game journalism I have something I’m passionate about but there’s also the fact that I may not make it and won’t be able to make enough to live a comfortable life. Debating on journalism/ English or accounting. Would like advice.
