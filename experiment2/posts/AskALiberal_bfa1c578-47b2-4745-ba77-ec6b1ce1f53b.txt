Why is libertarianism seen as a right-wing/conservative ideal?
I thought libertarianism is small government? Conservatism I thought still involves the government a lot (in the way of banning things such as abortion/gay marriage etc). Im not saying libertarianism is a liberal ideal but why is it seen as a right wing one?
