Lifting skin of my temple on the left side of my head dulls hearing and results in 'suction-like' sensation. 25M
Height: 6 ft 1. 

Existing medical issues: Chronic Insomnia.

Current medications: None.

Drink: Once or twice a week, rarely heavily.

Smoking: No.

Recreational drugs: No.

Problem: I noticed yesterday while brushing my teeth that if I touch my left-hand-side temple and pull the skin up my hearing suddenly dulls and I feel a strange suction-like sensation that is most apparent when I release my hold on the skin (sort of like if you clasp your hands together really tight and then release, it creates a similar sound but in my ear). There is no pain or discomfort. This is only a concern for me because it's something that I think must be recent (or else I'm not sure how I missed it) and because it only happens for the left temple.
