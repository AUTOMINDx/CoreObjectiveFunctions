Not sure to give 1 or 2 weeks notice
My new employer did not notify me that everything cleared. So for that reason I did not give my current employer notice. Today I need to tell my current employer something, if 1 or 2 weeks. I have asked my new employer to move back start date so I can give 2 weeks but they have not got back to me yet to confirm and would need to know today!!!
