Is anyone else pretty disabled and kind of forced rely on the Nparent?
I tried to post this before for support but some abled person jumped on and started splaining benefits to me as if i've never had that idea lol. 

I'm in my 30's. I have bipolar disorder. I have a number of physical health concerns. I also have autism. Jobs are few a far between. My health care relies on me being unemployed and i lose it if i find work. Saying get out and get away is all well and good but what about the people that can't? I feel like we get a little left behind.  
17% of disabled people are employed. 90% of autistics are unemployed. Fucking sucks.

Again please don't jump on my thread to tell me about benefits i have case worker and qualify for medicaid and that's all.
