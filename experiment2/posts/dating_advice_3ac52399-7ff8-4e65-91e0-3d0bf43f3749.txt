So confused!
I’m a 25 year old Female and I been seeing this guy for a few years now. I’m very open with him about a lot of things. The condoms we used was fragranced and it gave me an yeast infection. So I told him this. I’m very open with my mom as well. So I told her and she said I should or have told him because we are not married??? Huh? Lol. She said it’s none of his business and I should not have to tell him. I disagreed because he’s my sexual partner and I want to be very real
And transparent because I would want the same for me. Did I do the right thing by telling him! Or am I stupid ?
