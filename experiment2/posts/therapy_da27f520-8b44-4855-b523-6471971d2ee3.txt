I'm tired of hurting
throwaway account obviously. I can't take this anymore. I think I've been really depressed for years. Coming to a crux in college after a bad breakup. Haven't been eating much at all for weeks. Barely sleep. Can't bring myself to go to class, started failing some of them. I have no friends here. Everyone from my hometown knows me completely differently than I am. I have a lot of friends at home but cant talk to them. idk. idk where to start. I've been in pain for so long, I'm just so tired. idk what I need. Evrything has always felt hopeless.
