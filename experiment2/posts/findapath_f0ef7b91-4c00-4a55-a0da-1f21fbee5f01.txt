Tips on trying to break into tech?
I’m not exactly sure how to start this. I currently work in a retail store that I don’t get paid too bad at for a person my age (20) and I’m also currently in school to become a dermatologist, at least I’m still saying that. So, recently I’ve gotten a lot of inspiration to possibly try and break into the tech field, as it is a rapidly growing market. I’ve seen other people say to take google courses and such, but do those certificates actually come in handy? Where would be the best places to network? Best course/“boot camp” for coding?
