Is she just lying?
Alright guys i feel like my Gf lost interest in me. Due to the fact i’m always the first to send a text, and when i ask her why do i have to talk to you first? She always says “i’m afraid you could be busy or not in a good mood” she wasn’t like that at first, but recently i have to always text her first. Which is absolutely annoying, maybe because i told her that my university exams has begun. Maybe she found this excuse to just ignore me 

I’d love to hear your thoughts guys..
