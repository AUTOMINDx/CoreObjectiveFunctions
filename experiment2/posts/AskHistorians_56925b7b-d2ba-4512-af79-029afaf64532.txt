Was there ever a discussion in Britain of using Indian sepoys in Europe during the Napoleonic Wars?
Of course I realize that the sepoys of the late 18th-early 19th centuries were soldiers in a private army of the East India Company. But the EIC seems to have made use of "regular" British units on occasion, and at the height of Napoleon's conquests and with fears of a cross-Channel invasion, it seems (at least to a novice like me) like a reasonable thought to do the reverse and bring in some of this large, well-trained army for defense. It's certainly something that the British Empire was willing to do in the World Wars, when India was directly governed by the British. 

Was this ever considered? Or was it completely impractical for the logistics of the time? Or was there a fear of hosting basically a private army on or close to British soil that outweighed fears of Napoleon?
