Do I deserve a raise for being my restaurant's "guard"?
Sorry if this isn't the right place to write this I just need some advice about my situation.

I'm a 20 year old male who currently works in a restaurant  (a burger place) and I'm kind of a big guy. 6'2-'3 and 240 pounds, not really fat more just largely built. 

Anyways, this just happened about 2 hours before posting this. I was cleaning the back of the restaurant when my 2 female managers quickly run into the back telling me that there is an aggressive homeless man in the front. I walk up to the front and start asking the guy what's going on and what can I do for him, this was also 2 hours past closing and he'd gotten in through a side door that we use for getting in and out while the front is open. After about 3 minutes he just throws a cup and some change in our area and walks away in a huff. 

Though I was a little shaken because I didn't know what he was carrying, we were okay in the end. But as I was driving home I was wondering, why do I have to be this stores security and not get paid for it? This was not the only situation that I've had to put myself in harms way, about a month and a half before if posting this, I had stopped a fight with 2 men and ended the situation. With no "good job" or "Thank you".

What I'm getting at is, with these scenarios do I deserve a raise for doing something that isn't a part of my job but is beneficial for the safety of the restaurant? Or Is it selfish of me to ask for something that I should do as a large young man?
