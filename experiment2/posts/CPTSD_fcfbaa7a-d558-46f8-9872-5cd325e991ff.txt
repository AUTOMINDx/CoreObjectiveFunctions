What do you think about the trope that healing means symptom free?
I often read or heard about the goal of healing being symptom free. That never seemed feasible to me. Yesterday I talked to a friend. She is considered healed for a year now. She is doing much better than 2 years ago. But she still has nightmares (just much rarer) or bad days where she needs to curl up in a safe space. She still has trouble standing up for herself, just less so. She still has depressive episodes, just less of them.

Do you think healing means symptom free or do you just want to work trough that shit and having less symptoms?

Do you too find it unfair that no amount of therapy and hard work on ourselves will erase the damage done to us completely?

Have you heard of someone or know someone who managed to heal to a point of no symptoms at all?
