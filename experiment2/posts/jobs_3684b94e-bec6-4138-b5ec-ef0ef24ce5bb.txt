I want a part-time job but I feel that I am being ignored
Most if not all the part-time jobs that are evening/weekend that are about 20 hours want no experience or very little education. I just want a part-time job for maybe a year or two until I can find something that pays more in my field (IT).

 I figured that working 20 hours extra every week or even just 16 hours on the weekend would at 10-15k a year on my salary and that would help me achieve some of my earlier goals.

My education and work experience is nothing too crazy just an Associates and 3 years IT experience. Is it common to leave out previous jobs and education to get these jobs?

I just feel like people see these resumes and say "yeah that guy makes more money elsewhere and won't be here for long"
