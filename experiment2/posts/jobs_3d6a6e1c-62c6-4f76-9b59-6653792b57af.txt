Is it ok to take a job you don't want, even if it's 1,000 miles away?
I hear people say "sometimes you have to take a job you don't want to get the job you desire." I wholeheartedly agree. But often, when I get interviews for those jobs, they're located 100s or over 1,000 miles away in areas where I have no family or friends.

Is it still a good idea to take it?

UPDATE: these jobs often pay $25K-$35K. They're university administrative jobs, which are plentiful, but I cannot get interviews at my home institution or even nearby.
