Looking for tests to request and specialists to see
Hello, I am 14 years old, white, and assigned male at birth. I'm suspecting either a mast cell disorder, dysautonomia, an autoimmune disease, an endocrine disorder, a sleep disorder, a severe vitamin deficiency, or a functional disorder, the problem is that I don't have a good idea of what tests I should request or what specialists I should see. Do you guys have any suggestions?
