why won’t my brain accept that this is just anxiety and i’m ok
my mom says she’s worried that i’ll never accept that this is just anxiety and it’s going to keep impacting my life negatively. doctors have told me this is just anxiety but dpdr is so difficult and jt feels much worse than my typical anxiety
