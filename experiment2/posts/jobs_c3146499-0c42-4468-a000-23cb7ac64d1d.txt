What do you hate the most about writing your resume?
Hi all!

I've been helping a couple of friends lately with re-writing their resumes completely. Most of them are corporate employees with 2-5 years of experience. I don't blame them for having terrible resumes since they've only had to use it several times during their entire career.

Just want to conduct a quick survey. What do you hate most about writing resumes? Is it a huge time-suck? Cringy to write about yourself? Overwhelming task? etc.
