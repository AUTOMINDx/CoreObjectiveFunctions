When I am super anxious in therapy, but also slightly hypomanic, I tend to ramble, go into a trance almost, where I lose awareness of time passing and my own body movements, and everyone else in the room melts away — is this anxiety, hypomania or dissociation?
Its the strangest thing. Happens with friends too outside of therapy. Sometimes my friends will tell me I was rambling, or not making sense anymore. It’s not like I’m saying totally random stuff I just get absorbed into my own subjective experience so fully. Afterward I can’t remember what I said or how long it’s been and I’m quite embarrassed. It feels like a trance. Its very intense.
