[Lois &amp; Clark] Where did their baby come from?!?!
I've always thought the finale of this show was sweet, but it makes no sense. 

Who's baby is it? Who left it there? Is it a normal or powered baby? 

The show clearly was paying omage to Superman's own origin in which he just landed and was found by the Kents. But even if they didn't know where he came from at the time, they could clearly tell he was an alien. This baby deliverer left nothing.

Whoever left him (I'm assuming the baby's a he) clearly knows Clark is Superman and knows he and Lois recently found out they couldn't have kids.

The only one who knew about that was Dr. Klein, but even he didn't know Superman's identity.
