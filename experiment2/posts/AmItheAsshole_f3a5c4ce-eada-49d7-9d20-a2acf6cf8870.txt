AITA for not wanting to babysit?
For the background? I'm a long distance student and am also currently searching for a job, so I'm staying at home right now. 

My cousin has a toddler. On tuesday and wednesday, she asked me to help her out by babysitting him for the day. He was sick and was not allowed to go to kindergarden, and her and her husband had to work those days. I agreed and stayed with the kid basically all day. She also asked me to help babysit on friday, and i said ok, I'll helo out and I also stayed with the kid all day, since morning till 7:30 pm.

Now, when I was leaving on friday, I found out, that her husband was not at work that day, but in fact was at his parents house making sausages. I was mad, because I had to waste my entire day just so he could go run errands. Now, I know I'm staying at home, but I still have stuf to do. I have to shit at home, study, plus I got my past time activities, and the babysitting wastes my entire day. Today aunt called me, and asked me to hel babysit the kid on monday and tuesday as well, because cousin is putting him to different kindergarden since wednesday, and simply doesnt want to put him to his old kindergarden monday, tuesday. I told her no, because my help is not necessary, and my  time is valuable, and I got stuff to do. Then she tried to persuade me into babysitting, saying I only babysat him three times, and should also do it monday and tuesday. 

I don't know what to do. I babysat for free, and I don't want to waste two more days doing it. Plus I got a horrible migraine from spending all day with the kid. Am i an asshole for not wanting to babysit him anymore? What should I do in this situation?
