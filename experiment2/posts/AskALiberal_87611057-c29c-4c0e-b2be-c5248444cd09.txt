Do you think it’s possible for children to be ageist against grownups?
I’ve heard some people say that the only ageism that really matters is when someone in power uses age to discriminate against someone, usually an older worker.

But I also hear children say things like “all grownups are dumb dumbs” and “kids are the best.” It makes me think that maybe that’s ageism too.

So what do you think? Can children be ageist against grownups?
