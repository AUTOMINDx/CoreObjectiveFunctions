What do I do?
I'm 24, single, have no job, and still live with my parents. I also have severe social anxiety which is the main contributing factor to all of these issues. I've spent years looking for a job that would allow me to not have to interact with other human beings while at work but it just seems hopeless. I've even tried just settling for jobs because I feel so stuck and I need money to move out of my parent's house and really start living my adult life but I always end up having panic attacks and just not showing up for work due to the stress and pressure. My parents are of no help as every single day from the time I wake up until I go to sleep they just nag and complain that I'm lazy and could have a job by now if I really wanted one. My life is absolute hell and I really don't see any way to escape, I don't even have any friends to vent to or ask for advice because my anxiety and depression has caused me to isolate myself to the point that I really am alone all the time and even though that's what the anxiety wants it isn't what I want and I really just don't know what to do at this point. I feel like my anxiety has ruined my life to the point of not even wanting to have one anymore. Is there anything at all I can do before I just give up completely and accept my fate? This is a last ditch effort and I really don't know where else to post this tbh, any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.
