Post-COVID-19 psychosis?
This post is not about me, but about a family member. My father (M, 48 yrs, 6’2, 213lbs/97kg, white) No pre-existing illnesses or drug use) just got moved to an LTAC three days ago after fighting for his life from long covid for 3 months (fought through AKI, sepsis, ARDS with hypoxia, pneumonia, pneumothorax) Yeah it was bad. Physically, he is stable. Mentally, he seems delirious often. He seemed slightly confused in the other hospital, but it seemed like it was mostly from waking up from the sedation, nothing like the following details.

He was sedated September 1st, was tapered off by Oct 13th, and became aware/responsive quite a while later around October 25. He is completely awake and alert now, and the hospital says he’s at “level 2 mobility” (he can move his arms fully/text people/write. has some motion of his legs, but cant sit up.) He is still nonverbal.

My dad is showing symptoms of psychosis. He has a history of anxiety and nothing else. Throughout my visit today he asked if I  heard noises behind me, if there was anyone behind him, asked to use the bathroom in my apartment, asked what was next to me (it was a chair) and asked for “his knife” which he insisted was in the room, said “I’m dying and its your fault” (I have not had covid and I am vaxxed. He is not.) He will ask people why they’re mad at him when they are not. He is very irritable and forgetful. He told me he is aware that he’s hallucinating.

They are giving him 10 mg of Oxy and I am not sure about the Ativan dose. (Big big yikes) but delirium or hallucinations are not really listed under the side effects or interactions. My mother and I have suspected ICU psychosis after him being in the hospital for so long. (103 days now) I have also considered it being a permanent effect of low O2 sat or inflammation. I would like to hear any thoughts you can offer.
