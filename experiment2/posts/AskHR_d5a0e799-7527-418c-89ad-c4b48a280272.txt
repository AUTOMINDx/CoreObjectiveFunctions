[SC] How to politely turn down an offer while keeping the door open?
Hey all,

I got a job offer for an engineering position in the northeast. The offer is for about 10% more than I make now, however I currently live in the southeast and the change in cost of living would be 20-30% more expensive (a net loss). I was actually looking to make more money than I do now, but I would take the equivalent salary because I have family up there and that's worth something.

I asked politely if there was room to negotiate and the response that I got was "you can counter, but we do a good job assessing your worth based on our local market". To me that insinuates "we can budge a little bit, but we aren't going to significantly change our offer beyond a token increase."

At this point I am fairly certain we aren't going to meet on the salary, however I would like to be professional and polite as well as keep the door open with the company for other jobs that may pay a bit better.

How should I respond? Should I give them my real number anyway? Or should I just say it sounds like there is too great of a disparity and thank them for the time but express interest in other roles?

Thank You!
