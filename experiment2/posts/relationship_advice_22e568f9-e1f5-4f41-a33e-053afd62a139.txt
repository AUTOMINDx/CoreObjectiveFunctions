I feel my boyfriend doesn’t care about me or are child anymore 19(f) 29(m)
My boyfriend has become more and more distant from me ever since I gave birth to our child . Our baby is 6months old and I feel like I’m raising him alone . Idk what to do anymore he use to be so affectionate and reassuring of my feelings . I met him when I was going through a rough time in my life and I felt I didn’t have anyone else he was there for me. We’ve been together for 2 years and a half now I got pregnant during the pandemic and I moved in with him because I wanted to be closer to him . He’s never home and when he is he’s either asleep or playing video games . I’ve asked him why he’s been acting cold towards me and he says it’s because of stress from work . I told him I’d get a job to help with the bills but he says he rather him work and me stay home so that I can take care of our child 24/7 . He won’t even wakeup when the baby is crying in the middle of the night I’ve dealt with PPD alone and I have to remain mentally stable for my baby even though I feel like I’m losing my mind some days. He’s turned into a person I don’t even know anymore and I’m worried one day he will cheat on me again. Or get up and leave us .the only time we’re on good terms is when he wants sex or if we’re having an important conversation. I don’t want to move on from this relationship but sometimes I feel like I don’t have a choice ?
