Alternative to arduino
Hi all!
I want to make a small project, with a servo motor, a speaker and some leds.
I thought of arduino (maybe nano for small size).
What could be some other options?
I'm a beginner but I was thinking there should be other solution as for toys which doesn't need arduino because of the cost.
