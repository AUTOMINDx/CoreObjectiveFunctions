I got let in on some juicy family secrets
First up, my nan's dad's cousin got pregnant and left the child with her mum so she could go to work. Eventually she met a new man and just left the original kid with her mum. The kid grew up and thought that his great aunty was his mum and hat his actual parents were his siblings. He only found out in his 40s. Then the second one was my nan's cousin grew up with a single horrible mother. my nan's cousin never got told who her dad was, not even when she was with her mum at the hospital while she was dying. Nan's cousin has two brothers who were older than her and they said they remembered their uncle banging on the front door while shouting, "Let me see my daughter!". Oh no. Pretty sad.
