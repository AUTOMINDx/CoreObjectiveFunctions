I’m free!
I’m finally out of the shithole I considered my home for the past 19 years, my boyfriends parents were kind enough to let me live with them temporarily since I’m starting a new job soon and have enough saved to start renting a room out :D! i’m so happy and they have no idea where I am, I feel free
