[SG] My workplace is closing in 3 weeks (just informed), but my contract says notice period is 1 month. Do I need to serve the extra week of notice at a different work site, even if none of my students are willing to go to a different site?
As the title says, but some additional info below:

My work site is due to close by early January, and we were just informed, but we still have 2 other sites open. My contract states that my notice period is 1 month. However, I'm a part timer who is only on site on Saturdays, and given that Christmas and New Year both fall on Saturdays, this means that the last day I will be on site before the site closes in early January will likely be 18th December, which is only 3 weeks out.

So what happens? Will I still need to serve the extra week at a different site if my employer does not agree to just drop it?

I'm a teacher and none of my students are keen to move to a different site due to distance being a problem, so I wouldn't even have any classes to teach at a different site. There would literally be nothing for me to do there.

Edit: I had a conversation with my boss, and she said that Christmas weekend would count as part of my notice - just a working day with no classes, since I only get paid per class. So I wouldn't need to serve an extra week.
