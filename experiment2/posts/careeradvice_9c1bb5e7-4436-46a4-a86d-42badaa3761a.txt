What is the best way to get more clients in web development?
Hey,

I have been doing web development since 2015 and since then I have worked on variant projects.

First 4 years I worked as a freelancer on Upwork and I was getting clients and different projects about web development.

I also had one long-term client with whom I worked 3 years full-time/part-time, depending on the project's quantity.

I was dealing very well with the clients at that time, and 2 years ago I opened my company Conic Solutions ([https://www.conicsolutions.net](https://www.conicsolutions.net/)).

In that time my wife also started to learn about web development and now she is also working on the projects.

What we are trying to achieve is to gain more projects and expand the team.

That is not that easy and Iâ€™m here to ask for help or suggestions at least.

Do you maybe know the person or the company who could/would outsource some projects to us?

Or maybe you can share the websites where we could find potential partners.

Thank you very much!
