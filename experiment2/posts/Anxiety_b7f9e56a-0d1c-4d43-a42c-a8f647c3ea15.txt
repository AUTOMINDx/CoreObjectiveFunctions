I can ONLY be myself when Iâ€™m drunkâ€¦
Everytime i drink, i dont feel anxious and paranoid anymore and I just feel more confident and Iâ€™m more talkative and I donâ€™t get racing negative thoughts and it just feels so good to be a bit drunk and to feel free going like that. itâ€™s to the point that Iâ€™m actually saving alcohol for anxious situations or for when I go out, basically Iâ€™m using it to self medicate to not feel anxious, and I hate that I have to do that, I donâ€™t wanna be an alcoholic at a young age but itâ€™s like I have no choice really. Anti depressants isnâ€™t working for me, and itâ€™s hard to get prescribed benzos at 18. I donâ€™t think any doctor will understand me and my anxiety/confidence is just so bad ðŸ˜”
