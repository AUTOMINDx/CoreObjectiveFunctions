Are these normal pantoprazole side effects?
I started taking this medication today. About an hour or so after taking it, I started to feel weak in my legs and arms, a bit nauseous, and overall lethargic. I also had joint pain in my wrists and knee plus random stabbing pains on the top right side of my head in the same spot that come and go throughout the day (the pain isn’t too bad and it lasts than a minute each time but it’s still uncomfortable). I also suddenly started to feel very anxious. 

The symptoms became worse after I ate my first meal. I waited about an hour and a half then took a nap to see if it would help. I did feel a bit better after waking up. I wasn’t as tired and my arms and legs didn’t feel as weak, but I still had the joint pain and sharp head pains. I took the pill at around 1pm earlier and it’s already past 1am and I still have the random head pain and joint pain. My head pains are the most concerning to me since I don’t think I’ve experienced this before. Is it normal to feel like this after the very first dose?

PS: I initially took omeprazole. Started last month and moved to pantoprazole this month. I did not have these symptoms when I was taking omeprazole.
