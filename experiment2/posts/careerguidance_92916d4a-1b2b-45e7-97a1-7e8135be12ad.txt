How do I leverage recent jobs to enter IT?
I graduated college 7 years ago with a BS in Bus Admin-MIS and this is how my jobs went directly after graduation:

9months  Retail and then 6 years of temp-warehousing/factory work (around 3  seperate agencies and 5 different jobs). I currently work in Amazon and  desperately need to get out of there.

from high school to college I worked in fast food and delivery for about 7 years

My  issue is...how do I make a relevant resume for say, Help desk, if my  customer service experience was years ago and all of my recent  experience is completely irrelevant? I cant figure out how to optimize  my resume to enter into IT with irrelevant jobs and no linked IT  experience.
