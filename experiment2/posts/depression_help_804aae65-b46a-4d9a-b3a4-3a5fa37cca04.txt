Bad news Vs good news at the same time
My partner landed a new job, we celebrated and even got horribly drunk but it was good fun. I don't actually drink but I enjoyed the night with him anyway. I haven't seen my family or been back to my home town in a long time due to COVID. My mom was finally coming to visit me this Christmas but I got the news that she is band from entering the country I'm living in (restrictions). I was totally devastated and my partner could not handle that I was upset. He did not see it as a big deal really.  He has been trying to uplift me, but because I haven't just yet gotten to a point where I am okay, he gets angry and says that he is supposed to be happy about starting his new job and his not because of this. I don't have anyone I speak to or share my emotions with expect for him and now I feel guilty for making his happy time feel like a miserable time. I feel like the more I try to get out of the funk, the more I am pressured to come out it and made to feel horrible about it. He says he is worried about me, but I try reassure him that I will be okay with some time. I feel every time I'm just about to get out of the funk, he makes me feel bad again if I'm too apathetic or emotional. I can't win.  And I have recently come off my antidepressants and I'm doing my hardest to control my emotions

Any advice? Do I stop telling him anything that makes me sad when there is something great happening at the same time. I dont know
