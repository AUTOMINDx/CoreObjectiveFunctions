mom keeps on getting me the wrong medication
I take Specifically Famotidine/pepcid for my GERD, and she keeps on buying me omeprazole, probably because she read somewhere that it works better or something, i really dont know. She knows that we have two different issues (she takes omeprazole for her digestive issues, not heartburn/acid reflux related) and she keeps on getting me them anyways

recently id just been out for a week and she bought me omeprazole. I knew from last time this happened they didnt work but i decided to take them anyways, and that time i even had a full on allergic reaction and I feel like even that wont get her to just buy me the right medication. if my doctor wanted me to take these she would've prescribed them to me instead
