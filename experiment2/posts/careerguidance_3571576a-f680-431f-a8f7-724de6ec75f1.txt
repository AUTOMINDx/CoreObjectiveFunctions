52 years old and wondering what to do next?
Hello there. My name is Thomas Riccardi and I am 52 years old and recently did not pass probation for a job and wasn't given a reason so just like that on the 17th of November I am without a job. It's.. disheartening to say the least and right now I feel lost, scared and days when I feel hopeless. Yes I applied for unemployment and that'll go through however, I want to go back to work right now but I feel a few things.

1. Are there people that are even going to want me because of my age? Age discrimination is a thing and even though I have 20 years of experience in an office environment and at least 4 years in a call center environment I feel that I can bring a lot to an organization.
2. People have talked about freelancing and I wouldn't even know how to start that process. I am also a writer and can write about any subject however most of the jobs that I have taken have been for "exposure" or "trade for" as in you write an article about X and you keep it.
3. Working from home / remote jobs. Like #2 I would LOVE to do this however, where do you even start? There are PLENTY of paid sites like for the freelancing position but my father used to say "Any job where you have to pay money to work is a scam"

I know I haven't been out of work a long time it's just a lot of things are settling in and I am doing what I am supposed to be doing but part of me feels like there's more to be done. I am registered with a temp agency, I have a linked in profile that's active, I am on ziprecruiter and I am applying for jobs with that site but what else can I do? If anyone can please reach out to me and help me forge a new path I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks so much for reading this and I hope everyone is having a better time at it than myself.
