In a Solar pond, why does the bottom get to a higher temperature?

I don't understand how it works after reading the wiki article. The water at the bottom is supposed to get to a higher temperature and begin convecting, which is then stopped by adding salt. But why would it even get warmer at the bottom? I thought the sun would heat the surface water more and thus it should be the surface water convecting downwards.
