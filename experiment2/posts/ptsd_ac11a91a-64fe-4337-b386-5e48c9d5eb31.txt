Something disturbs me and then I am out of sorts/anxious for hours. What do you do?
This morning I saw a video that was MILDLY disturbing. I found myself anxious and irritable since then. And also, I feel a bit unmoored- like I canâ€™t focus properly or I am missing something really important. 

What is this exactly that happens to me?  

How do you settle your brain back down when this happens?
