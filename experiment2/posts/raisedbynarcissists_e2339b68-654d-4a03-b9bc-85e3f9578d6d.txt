i did it. i left.
thank you to all the advice everyone has given me i really appreciate it. My friend helped me move in w her yesterday and i disnt tell them at all. It took them a whole day to even realize i left and once they did they have been trying to say it was disrepsectful of me not to tell them and outright saying im just only couch surfing and that i had it better at their place since they wouldnt let me work. Its kind of pathetic how hard they try to guilt trip me once im out of their grasp ... Why do they even give a shit im gone?

But it still kinda sucks. They still got me to cry and tried to say my friends would turn against me and hate me. I know they wont but i hate how they still get under my skin like that. Im gonna try and get a backroom job at walmart and hope they wont find me. Im also gonna swing back by and get into the shed for the last of my shit and the amiibo i accidentally left. Wish me luck.
