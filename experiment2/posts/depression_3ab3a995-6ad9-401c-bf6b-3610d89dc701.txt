Nutritious, easy to make food to have around for depressive episodes
Every time I get into a depressive episode, my will to make food just goes down the drain. I usually just make pasta with pre-made sauce, but I don’t think it’s very nutritious on it’s own, and lately I’ve been kind of sick of it. 
Do you have any tips or recipes that could be easy to make or preserve/have around for pre-heating? 

Thanks!
