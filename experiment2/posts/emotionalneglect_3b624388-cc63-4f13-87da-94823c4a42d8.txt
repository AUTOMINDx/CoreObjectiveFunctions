Lately im loosing control at everything
i hate it when things didn’t turn out the way i wanted. And lately there’s a huge change happening around my life and it feels like life is taking huge leap on me. While taking advantage of my ignorance. I hate things that are happening right now in my life. I feel like a puppet doing what life gives in the most minimum level. I hate it when i lost control over my life.
