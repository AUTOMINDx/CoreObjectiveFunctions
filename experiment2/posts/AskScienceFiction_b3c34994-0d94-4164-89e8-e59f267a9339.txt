[Power Rangers] Given the established fact that morphing increases previously acquired skills, why aren't more rangers trained military personnel?
We know morphing increases skills in addition to physicals as many rangers showcase (Billy becomes a high tier fighter when morphed, and his combat prowess increase as he begins out of morph training with Jason and Tommy, the Jungle Fury Rangers entire storyarc, Dino Fury's Izzy's jousting skills massively improve when she morphs into an elite spear fighter, her brother Javi's fencing skills improve as a ranger into a major swordfighter, and Dino Charge's Riley becoming an elite swordsman when unmorphed, he's just a rookie fencer) Why don't the Morphin' Masters choose people who have already been trained to perfection in the arts, such as special forces members or elite warriors? Why do they instead choose regular teens/young adults from random walks of life?
