Does anyone sometimes cry to random songs that for whatever reason reach them deep in the moment??
I'm not as much into classic 80s as I used to be, but for whatever reason Pat Benetar's "Love Is A Battlefield" has me super emotional today. Heard it on the radio one off and I'm stuck in a cry/sad thoughts loop. The more I think about the lyrics the more it hits home. What a banger! For reference, this happens at least once every 2 months to whatever song reaches me at that time, can be any genre so long as it's good.
