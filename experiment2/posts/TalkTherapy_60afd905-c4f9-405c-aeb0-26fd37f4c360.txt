Will my therapist want to know about this?
I'd really appreciate some opinions about if you think I should share the following experience with my therapist.

Basically when I was 19 I went out for some drinks with a guy who was 22. When we were on the bus home he asked if I wanted to stay at his that night. I said no as I wasn't interested (he was drunk and giving off bad energy). He wouldn't take no for an answer though and became sulky and annoyed. I didn't know what to do, I felt trapped. I was worried that if I got off at my bus stop he'd follow, so I thought I should just do what he wanted and everything would be ok. 

I just feel ashamed at myself for putting myself in that position. Nothing happened except for a bit of aggressive kissing and he tried to take my clothes off. I managed to leave and ran all the way home.

I just feel guilty about wanting to share this with my therapist as other people have had way worse happen to them.
