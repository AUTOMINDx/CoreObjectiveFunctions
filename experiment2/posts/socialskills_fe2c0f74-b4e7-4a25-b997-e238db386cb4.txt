Meetup Messup
So I was going to attend a meet up this weekend, but something happened and I had to back out. I left a message on the meet up stating this, but it turns out that the event was actually next weekend. I found that out when the host replied that it was actually the next weekend. 
I feel a bit foolish and I basically sent a reply saying I was a bit embarrassed, I admitted my mistake and I wished them a fun time and said I would make time to join them in the future. 
Was there any thing I could have done better here. You know, besides making the blunder in the first place? I'm still new to this state and I definitely want the opportunity to expand my social circle and not burn my bridges.
