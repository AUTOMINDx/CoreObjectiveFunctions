Will I ever be able to make friends ?
I have always had issues with friendship and I have never kept a friendship for more than maybe 2 years. I have grown to know I am the problem so I have been working hard to be a better friend and kinder person. I go to therapy and DBT, I read books and watch videos, I ask family and a friends where they think U could improve. 

Every time I believe a friendship is going well and I am improving it falls apart. Tomorrow is my 21st birthday and I am once again completely alone. Iâ€™m desperate to find ways to keep friendships and notice what I am doing to upset people and lose friends. Any suggestions ?
