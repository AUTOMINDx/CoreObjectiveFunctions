I feel awkward?
So lately as I'm starting to come out of my whole introvert shell I'm finding myself faced with a very difficult task and that's being comfortable around people, letting loose, I can't even let myself relax enough to dance, lol. And like it's not like I'm scared to talk to anyone, in fact I'm often the one who initiates the first "Hi, how are you" but when we're in the conversation I never have much to add unless we're talking about sports, gaming, or food. If it's anything other than those conversations then I literally have nothing much to add there other than just playing off whatever the other person is giving. 
  The bothersome thing about this is the total opposite of how I want to be and how I am when I'm online and honestly that's the version of myself that I want people to see because that truly is the real me but if that's true why am I holding myself back? Why do I fear what people will think if I show my humor, attempt to dance, sing, etc. 

How do I change?
