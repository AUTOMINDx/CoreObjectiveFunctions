Would dimpled race car wings work?
Years ago Mythbusters tested the idea that a car with a dimpled surface could get better mileage.  Another person took this further using a vinyl wrap with smaller dimples on a 911. The idea that the dimples create small bubbles of air making a sort of boundary layer for air to smoothly flow over.  

So my question is this.  If an aerodynamic device is dimpled (spoiler, wing), can it still give downforce, and have reduced drag?  If so, seems like a great way for race engineers to get down force with hurting top speed with drag.
