AITA for criticising my (M18) mother’s methods of punishing my brother (M14) and going too easy on him?
This is a loaded post but a week ago my brother was caught in a mess when he was found stealing my dad’s cigarettes. His phone was taken off him and he was punished by being banned from watching TV. 

However, my brother took his phone back and my mother knew it, but didn’t say anything. 

The next day, my brother was not found anywhere in the house and my dad discovered that his cigarettes were missing AGAIN! And he was NOT happy at all. He refused to talk to my brother or drive my mother to look for where my brother was, because my mother doesn’t know how to drive.

Now this is where the real problem starts, a week after, my mother has arranged a day out with my brother to shop for some shoes for him, and bought him more than £150 worth of shoes, that amount I would never see in a million years. 

I berated my mother on how she has failed my brother as she keeps letting him get away with his troubles even though he has been excluded from school and causing arguments and stealing cigarettes from my dad and smoking and having tantrums.

I was angry particularly because I have never once done any of those things and I will be the first person in the family to go to college and I get straight As in school and have never got detention in years. But, if I had done ONE thing that he has done, she would not treat me the same. I also recently won several awards due to my achievements in school… yet I have heard nothing from my mother about it except for ‘I am proud of you’ yet she goes out of her way to buy her demon child shoes that costs more than £150 for no particular reason? 

She started crying about how ‘I can’t get on with the family’ and I need to be there for my brother.

AITA?
