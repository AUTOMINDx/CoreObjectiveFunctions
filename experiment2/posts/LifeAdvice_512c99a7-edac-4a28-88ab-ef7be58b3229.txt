Should I stay with my dad or move to my mom?
15 yo male

I have to decide whether or not I should move to the east coast to be with my mom or stay with my dad in a small mid western hometown. 

7 years ago I was told that my mom was leaving, the separation was pretty clean by most standards, its what came after that spoils things. My mom left my dad but remained in our hometown, during this time which was about 2-3 years I would see her very sporadically. My dad claims it was because she was uninterested in me but I can't be sure. After an accident which left her lungs in incredibly bad shape, she was recommended by doctors to move somewhere closer to water. So she left for New York. I chose to remain with my dad throughout all of this because I didn't want to leave all I've ever known behind. Fast forward to now and things have become complicated; My mom wants me back in her life, and I want to be back too. But my dad hates the idea, he says my mom cheated on him and left us for another guy, mom says he got controlling and a bit creepy so she started feeling trapped and had to leave. My mom hates that she left me behind and wants me back, my dad doesn't want me with her. The issue is that I enjoy being with my mom whenever I see her for holidays, I enjoy living somewhere that isn't this small town I'm in now. I respect my dad and his judgement though so when he says its a bad idea I believe him, but I also know what happened in the separation and the fault of both my parents in it happening. My dad thinks my mom is a cheating liar, my mom thinks my dad is overcontrolling and stubborn. The story as a whole has too much that I can't be sure about because the people telling it to me are too biased against each other. Reddit, I need unbiased opinions on what my decision should/could be.
