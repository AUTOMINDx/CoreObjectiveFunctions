I Left My Job Due to Harassment, Now my Boss Desperately Wants Me Back (Should I Go Back?)
I've been at the job in question longer than the two new employees (almost a year). The store employees consist of myself, two other guys, and the store owner. Store Owner is absent from shop during the day since he operates other business.

After working with these new employees, it became apparent that the new manager was very insecure about me and was trying to get me fired. Since I know more about how the machines in the shop run than himself. The other guy doesn't want to help out with orders and gets angry with I ask him to help out. He's very hostile towards me, yells at me, and calls me a "delusional woman." Since the manager guy was talking smack about me to my ower every second he could, and hostile guy yelling at me every second he got, I decided to leave.

So, I handed my keys in; owner got very mad at me saying that I did nothing, and admitted that the two other guys were talking smack about me behind my back.  Fast forward four days later, he sent a text begging me to come back since I was vital to the operation of this business.

IDK what to do. All advice would be helpful.

TLDR: Left a hostile work environment. Now they want me back since I was a vital and skilled employee.
