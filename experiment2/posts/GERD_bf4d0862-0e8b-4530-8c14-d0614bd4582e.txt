Gerd? Helppp.
A few months ago I started getting a sharp pain under my left rib. I ignored it for sometime, but then it started to hurt directly in the middle of my chest. It feels as well if someone is scratching my sternum with a fork. I even lost my voice randomly for a week. I am starting to believe I have gerd. Sometimes the pain is so excruciating that I feel like passing out and I get very dizzy. I take tums and heartburn medicine but I don’t feel as if it’s really helping. Any advice would be helpful. I even went to the e.r because it felt like my chest was getting electrocuted. EKG was fine, X-rays and cat scan came back fine too. I didn’t think it was gerd at the time so I didn’t mention it and the doctor said he thinks my chest is strained and sore muscles.. ugh.
