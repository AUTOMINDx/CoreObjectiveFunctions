Friends and chronic illness
Hello there!

I just need to vent a maybe get some advice on what to do.

I am freshly 20 years old, diagnosed with migraines for about 4-5 years.  I had like 2-3 attacks a month, which was managable and nobody except my family knew I have it.

But right after I got COVID a year ago, everything kinda changed.  My migraines progressively got worse, and now, from of September, I have approximately 15-25 migraines a month, and if I don't have a migraine, I have a headache with dizziness.

My next neurology appointment is on 14th of December, but I will have a new neurologist soon, specialized on migraines and headaches.

But that's not why I am writing here.

As I said, my life changed.  Migraines are controlling me, even through medication (I am on beta-blockers, anti-depressant, and I was on triptans and anti-epiletics - nothing really works), and it is affecting every aspect of my life.  Even in school, when I am with my friends.

I am getting a bit worried - everybody around me is getting confused, or even mad, that I have so many migraines, and that I am not what I've used to be.  Not as happy, energetic, etc.  That I should be "used to the pain".  Some of them stopped talking to me, because I was talking about it too much.  

I have some good friends that understand me, support me and love me through it - but I am scared I will loose them too.  I am trying to hide the pain, trying to not talk about it too much - but it is a bit hard.  I am scared that they will get tired of me. 

What should I do? Should I be worried?  

With love,

Eli
