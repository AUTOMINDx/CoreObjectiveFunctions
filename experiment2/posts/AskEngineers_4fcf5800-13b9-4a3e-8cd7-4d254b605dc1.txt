Considering going back to school
I'm 32 years old and looking at going back to school for engineering, either civil or chemical. I have a B.S. in environmental science from when I was 23. My career so far has involved lab, regulatory, and as a wastewater plant operator. Currently, I'm an environmental inspector. The job is okay but I find it unfulfilling. I enjoy the troubleshooting aspect of wastewater operations and I see engineering as an extension of that. I have some money saved up and my girlfriend surprised me the other night by encouraging this. I know it's a lot of work but I'm just not sure if the payoff is real.
