Is there something wrong with me?
I’ve been working in my current company for 7 years. I have established a long professional relationship with my colleagues. But today is one of my hardest days, my department manager told me that to be honest with you most of the employees don’t like you so be more friendly and social with others. And when I asked him if this has to do with my work goals and expectations he said it isn't related and there is nothing wrong with my work performance but I have to be more friendly. So Just because I act professionally and not invite people daily to my office to gossip and joking around dose not means I am not social or not friendly and I don'ttreat people rudelyI just act professionally. Now I am quite shocked, sad, depressed and feeling betrayed. After all these years my manager now evaluate me based on  gossipers opinions rather than evaluate me based on my work quality and discipline. What to do please. is he right that something wrong with me since as he is claiming that most of my colleagues don't prefer to deal with me.
