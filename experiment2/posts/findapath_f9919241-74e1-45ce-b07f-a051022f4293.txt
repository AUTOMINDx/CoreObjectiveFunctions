Trouble thinking of possibilities outside the box I have closed myself up in. Any ideas you guys?
I really want to change things in my life, but I feel like I'm having trouble thinking of possibilities outside the box I have closed myself up in. Any ideas you guys? 

Thank you in advance for your knowledge and insight! Open to suggestions that don't satisfy all of these. :) I have a bachelor's in Biology.

**My ideal job:**

* location independent
* autonomous
* pay $65k/year or more (I would like to be able to help take care of my parents as they get older)
* would make me feel like a badass/would actually have some sort of impact/be fulfilling
* would involve learning new, interesting things
* would not require a ton of additional schooling/training since I am almost 40 now, 
* I love animals &amp; would love if they were somehow involved
