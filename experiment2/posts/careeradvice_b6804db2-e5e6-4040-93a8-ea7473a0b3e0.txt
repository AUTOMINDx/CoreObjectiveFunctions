How do I get started with my career shift into tech?
I (22 F) work at a high volume call center as a supervisor. I am comfortable and I like my job sometimes but as a single mother I need something more secure $$. I have been interested in tech but Iâ€™m nervous to take the leap. So my question: how do I get started? What type of research should I do? How do I prepare for my education towards this? I have never had any guidance all my life so I feel very lost.
