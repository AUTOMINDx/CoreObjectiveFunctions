Meditation I get crazy
When I meditate there’s no breathe. It’s like my breath is afraid to breathe. I don’t know how to explain this but my mind get me so worse when I meditate. This shit is killing me. 
Brothers I’m going to buy a vape because this helps a lot my anxiety and mental health it’s like when I vape I have 17 years old but when I don’t vape it’s like I have 13 years old mentality. What’s happening in my life is so crazy. 
And the other fact that bothers me is that when I go to sleep my mind can’t. It’s like my body is in my bed but my soul is just imagining situations and things.
I’m failing all my exams, I’m going to fail 4 subjects because in Spain high school is so strict. I don’t know who is writing this but it’s calming me down. 
Give me some love is all I need. I never felt the love of anyone in my life. And when my mother tries to hug me it’s like I don’t feel the vibe it’s like I m so neutral. 
Thank you so much for reading this now I’m going to study but I don think I will pass because this situation is killing my mental health 
Please give me some advice I’m so alone I’m and depressed in my daily routine
