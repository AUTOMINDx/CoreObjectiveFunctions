Scared I'm not going to survive this
My depression keeps getting worse and worse and now I have had over a year of recurring suicidal episodes and I am constantly scared that I'm going to actually die next time. I have started to worry about not having stuff prepared for when I die and so have began to plan things for afterwards but this is making me more suicidal but I don't know how to stop this. I am scared that one day I'm not going to survive this. I have reached out. I have sought out medication and have been on waiting lists for therapy for ages but I think it's getting too late. I don't know what else to do please can someone help me.
