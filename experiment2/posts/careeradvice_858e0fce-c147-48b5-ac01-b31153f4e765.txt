I have no idea what to do after college
I'm a final year Business student, if things go as planned I'll graduate this summer.

Probably is I have no idea what I want to do after graduating.

I just know i want to eventually start my own business - that's always been a goal of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I've been putting the cart before the horse..

I've been looking at jobs/masters programmes and what not with an eye as to 'how will this help be eventually start a business?' That's just left me none the wiser.

Finance, Accounting and Economics are not my forte - Always excelled in Marketing, Management and HR, basically exams where I just soak in the info and regurgitate it with a twist.

So I've considered Marketing, Digital Marketing particularly there's a Masters at my college (cheap in Ireland), and it's supposedly quite good.  
But I don't know if I really like marketing, it's interesting but half of the adverts I see annoy me to no end.

Considering a conversion course into Software Development, something that's always interested me and that I can see great benefits from learning the skill... That being said I've tried to teach myself in the past and struggled to stay motivated, maybe it's not for me.. Or maybe I just need the structure of a degree programme to learn the basics?  


Considered Sales too, great skill but again, not sure if it's for me.

I've also considered learning a trade, again.  
I was an apprentice electrician - hated that, but I've always respected the blue collar business owners.  
Learn a skill, apply my business brain.  


The most successful guy I know runs a company doing IT for schools.. 

There are 101 ways to make money, I just don't know where I should start..  


Any ideas?
