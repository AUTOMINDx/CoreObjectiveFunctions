What do I do to start a decent paying career?
Hi All, sorry for formatting on mobile.

I am 24M, looking to really get started in a decent paying career. I have no uni degree, and I kinda wasted 3 years in college doing nothing of any relevance. I am working in accounts for a massive company rn. They promised me at 6 months in I can look at options to train as am accountant alongside work, which they will pay for. However, now they say I have to have been there 12 months. Do I stick this out and play the long game for this, or what can I do to get the hell out of here. I want to do something challenging and rewarding. I have looked at things like Cyber Security but I have no idea where to start.

Any tips on where to start and what to look into?
Cheers in Advance!
