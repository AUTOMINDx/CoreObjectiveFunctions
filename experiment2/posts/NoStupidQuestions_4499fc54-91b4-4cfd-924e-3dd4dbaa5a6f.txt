Does driving get better?
I recently got my license this month and to say I’m a bad driver would be an understatement. I just feel I’m so bad at it. It doesn’t feel smooth when I drive, I’m a big hesitater because I get nervous, and I don’t even want to comment on yellow lights. Those things make me panic. I know everyone says practice makes perfect, but my friends seem so good already and I’m just very insecure about my driving abilities. It’s something I need to work on, I just hope it gets better and I actually improve instead of worsening. Thank you.
