Need help putting on weight
Hey guys, I’ve always been a skinny guy. I’ve been working out for some time now and have good development but I find it very hard to put on weight. I have GERD and cannot eat in large quantities. Whenever I have Whey protein I end up with horrible cramps and sitting on my toilet at 5 am for 2 hours. I want to try creatine but I’m afraid the same thing will happen. Can any one recommend a diet, protein powder, or creatine that wouldn’t kill my stomach, it would be greatly appreciated.

Also I am 5 foot 9 132-137 lbs
