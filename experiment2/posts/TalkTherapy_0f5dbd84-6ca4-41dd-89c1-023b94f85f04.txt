Should i ask T for our meeting notes?
Ive been seeing my T for about 6 months now. Sheâ€™s the best ive had for me so far. Recently ive been thinking about seeing my notes from our meetings to see what she has written about me. I guess i want to do it for self-evaluation reasons. Like i want to know what she sees about me in words. I know its my choice whether i want it or not, im just wondering if its smart or not to do it. 

Would it be something smart for me to do?
