Police officers of Reddit, do you think the cops in the Ahmaud Arbery trial treated the suspects appropriately right after learning they were involved in a shooting?
I just thought it was protocol to place the suspects in handcuffs especially after a shooting where someone is dead, just to be on the safe side. 

Were the cops correct in letting the shooter Travis walk all around freely right after pulling up to the scene?
