When do I tell a new employer I plan to be home (out of state) for a week?
I am applying for jobs after moving across the country, and I plan on being home for the holidays, likely Dec 23 thru Jan 1. Obviously, some jobs this would be a huge issue &amp; others maybe not as much. When should I tell a prospective employer that I will not be available those dates? During job interview, after job offer, or after offer acceptance?
