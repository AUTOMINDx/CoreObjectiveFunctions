Why is there not more evidence for pre-Clovis human presence in the Americas?
Every so often a news story comes along about how shocking new evidence proves, this time for real, that humans were in the Americas earlier than thought and that we can finally put Clovis First to rest. The White Sands footprints is the latest of these and seems nicely definitive, I have not been able to find any real challenges to the dating or identification, but it does raise a bit of a problem in that the Clovis culture, aside from matching up neatly with some bits of paleoclimate research, is pretty widespread and Clovis points are plentiful. Meanwhile the pre-Clovis sites are a handful of what appear to be temporary campsites, not exactly Altamira. What I have read (which is almost exclusively popular rather than academic) seems to gleefully point out that "Clovis First" is finally dead without noticing that this seems to open up a massive gap in the material record.

Is this a problem of misidentification, in that sites that were "pre-Clovis" were incorrectly dated and now might be reassessed? Is it possible that the Clovis culture itself is wrongly dated and so it isn't so much "pre-Clovis" as Clovis point makers being in the Americas much earlier than was thought? Or is the general evidence for "Paleo-Indians" just much thinner than I had thought?
