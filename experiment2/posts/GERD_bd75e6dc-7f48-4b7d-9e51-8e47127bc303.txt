Burning nostrils, raw mouth, tight chest, and upset stomach. Is this normal? (LPR)
Hey guys, 

I’m a 33-year old male and have been having a really rough go of things lately. I recently quit coffee, and I’ve been feeling pretty awful for the last few days. My nostrils and mouth feel raw and burn, my chest is tight, I have a bit of a headache, I still feel the post nasal drip, and my stomach just feels upset and irritated. I’ve been trying to eat better lately, but so far it hasn’t been helping too much.

I recently had an endoscope, and they found that my LES was weak and didn’t shut all the way. I also tested positive for h pylori, but it seems to be gone now. I’m not sure what else I can do, but I’m tired of feeling so awful each day. I’m seeking any help I can get.
