Internet socket help please
So I've just moved into a new house and my Internet speed is ass, I think it's the layout of where my room is for wireless. In the old house I used a powerline adapter but in the new room I only have 2 sockets and they're both in awkward places even for a power strip, which I know you shouldn't do for a powerline adapter.

My actual question is about the Internet sockets in walls that look like ethernet sockets but are thinner, kind of like USB ports. I assume there's an adapter out there for this socket to ethernet I just can't find the name of the socket and was wondering if anyone could help either with the name for the socket or adapter or just a better way to try and plug my pc in

Thanks
