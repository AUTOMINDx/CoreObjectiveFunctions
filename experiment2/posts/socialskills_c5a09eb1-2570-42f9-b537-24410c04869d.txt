I feel like I’m watching a TV show whenever I’m in a social setting. Help?
Previous post was removed for some reason? I haven't broken any rules. This is relevant to social skills.

Title doesn’t really make sense. You know how you watch conversations or social interactions in TV shows or movies your brain stays passive? Yeah, that’s how I am with every social interaction. And social interactions require your brain to be quick on its feet, to respond in milliseconds. My brain doesn’t do this and instead stays passive, as if it’s watching a bunch of people talking to each other on TV. DAE feel like this? Any tips on getting out of this is appreciated
