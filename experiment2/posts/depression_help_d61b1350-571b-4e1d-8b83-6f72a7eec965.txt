What else can happen to me?
Hey yall. I have major recurring depression and it got worse these past 6 months. It feels like nothing is going right around me. I lost my job in July,  I haven't been getting any unemployment and I can't even get a job. I'm just wondering what else is going to hit me down and make my life awful. ðŸ˜©
I just had my 21st birthday and that was the first day in a long time where I wasn't worried or sad about what's happening.
