Anxious about getting Sick
Hi. I was at college and a kid next to me coughed and they weren’t wearing a mask and they didn’t cover the cough. I was wearing a mask do you think that the mask will give me any protection? Whenever I get sick I have an issue with brain fog. Do you think that I could get sick? I am very anxious about this.
