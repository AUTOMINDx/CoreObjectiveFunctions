Are there hotlines you can call if you’re not in a crisis?
I️ just woke up from sleeping for 11 hours. I kept going back to sleep because I️ don’t want to be awake. I don’t want to do anything.  

My mental health is bad again. I️’m not planning to kill myself, but I have a pile of work I️ need to do that I️ don’t feel like doing. I also have started skipping meals again to feel good about myself and don’t plan to eat today. I️ feel sick from not eating but I️ don’t want to anyway.  

I️’m on campus early so I️’m just here all alone. I also don’t wanna bother my friends with my bullshit. I don’t know. I️ guess my situation really isn’t all that bad, but I️ just want someone to talk to. Is there a hotline I️ can reach out to if I️’m not in danger?
