Kidney Infection
I believe I have a kidney infection. The past week and a half I have been getting very bad pains in my right flank sporadically and also when I urinate. Changing position/massaging the area does not help. I have a loss of appetite, been very nauseous, I have gotten very close to vomiting more than a few times, and I have been dealing with tachycardia. It has been extremely difficult for me to eat and drink. At this point I have been living off of approximately 170 calories a day and have lost 10lbs+ from it. I have been to the ER twice this past week, both urinalyses showing bacteria in my urine. However, the doctors I have saw in ER have told me that my urine “looked good” and this isn’t a “life threatening condition” and my kidney pain is “musculoskeletal”.
