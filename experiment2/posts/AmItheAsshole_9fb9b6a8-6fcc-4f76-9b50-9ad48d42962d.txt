AITA for leaving her with an apatment she can’t pay for herself?
So, after 6 1/2 years in a relationship with my girlfriend. (Lets call her Maria.)

We got together when we were 18/19 y/o and over the course of the years we have experienced a long distance relationship where Maria studied in another town and I prepared myself for serving in the military. As Maria studied she left for Hawaii to study abrod and when my one year of service were finished and she got back from Hawaii we moved inn together. Four years passes and she got her masters degree and I managed to get a bachelors degree.
We’ve had our up’s and down’s during this time together and we decided to move again. She allready had a plan but could not manage it alone since rent was to high. Maria wanted to move to the big city where she could get a good payed jobb and myself wanted to move to another town to continue studying, but personally i did not want to leave Maria again, so, for her I moved to the big city as well.
Now after three months she all of a sudden decides to tell me she want’s to break up cause she have «lost the spark we once had». On top of this Maria claims that she wanted to spilt up for over a year, but was to insecure about it and wanted to try and see if we lived somewhere else she would not feel as she had during the prior year.
So now i cant stay in the apartment. I have to get out and she wants me to pay for rent until the landlord finds someone else for it, but I never signed a contract. Its all in her name, so I’m packing my bags and never looking back.

AITA for leaving as it is?
