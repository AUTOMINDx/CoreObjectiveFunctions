Interviews on picket lines?
I just finished my MA thesis on a California teacher strike. While doing research, I realized noone had done much in the way of interviews at any of the picket lines or sites, it made my project more speculative, detached, and post-hence. 
With so many strikes going on, is there any precedent for grad students going out, doing relatively non-disruptive interviews, and helping out along the way as unofficial/unaffiliated interview projects/groups? Not to write on the strike as a journalist but to collect and record stories and subjectivities as we move forward?
Is it in any way desired? Are there glaring ethical challenges to it? 
I simply feel in my experience it would have been helpful as well as respectful to the legacy of the teachers’/community’s participation and struggle to have the voices of those involved, anonymized or not.
