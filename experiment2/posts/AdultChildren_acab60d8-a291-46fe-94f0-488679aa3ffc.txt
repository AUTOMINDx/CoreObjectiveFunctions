Dreading visits
My mom invited an alcoholic family member ive been avoiding to come stay with us for nearly a week and im dreading it.  Ive known about the trip for a while now, but theres pretty much no place for me to escape to.  I cant drive, and we've just moved to a new place, so i dont have any friends i can stay with just yet to avoid her.

What makes me most upset is that my mom has been trying to convince me to give her another chance.  I finally snapped and told her i dont care if she apologizes to me if shes not going to change.  I think she finally got it and seems to be feeling guilty a bit about inviting her over but still refuses to call her and cancel.

Ive blocked a lot out of my teenage years because i was so unhappy living with my alcoholic father, and just visiting her for a couple days was so uncomfortable as a kid.  I was constantly anxious i was going to screw up, and when she wasnt trying to passive aggressively tell depressed and socially anxious teenage me to go talk to people i didnt know, she was getting drunk and inviting her friends over.  I was constantly anxious that she was going to hurt herself, or something bad would happen, and i felt responsible for her while she was inebriated (taken a long time to unlearn THAT one).  

Im absolutely dreading her coming and i just dont know what i can do, because the way i see it happening right now is shes going to start something and my mom is going to blame me, shes going to cry because i wont forgive her, and then shes going to get drunk and make a huge mess.  I really cant see anyone getting out of this not hurt unless i "suck it up" and play nice which i really dont want to do
