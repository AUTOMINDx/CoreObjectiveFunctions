What's family for you?
I'm struggling to understand how a person must behave so that the relationship can be called family. 
My wife grew up in a loving family, I grew up in violence and physical/psychological abuse. I make her upset because I don't know what I suppose to do for being a worthy family for her.
But please don't look at this fact. How do you imagine young family? what do you think partners should do in relationship for each other? How young partner should treat each other to grow in a strong family?
