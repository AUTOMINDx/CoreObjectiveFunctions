Where the hell did the Greeks come from??
Iâ€™m self studying world history and I am deeply confused. The chapter before is about how early Europeans went from hunters to adopting agriculture from the Middle East and creating temples, and out of no where the Greeks show up and they have already invented everything?? Where did they come from?? What about Greek culture lead to the explosion of Great thinkers?? Please someone fill in the gaps in my knowledge.
