starting my career at 30(24 now) in Mechanical engineering is there anything to be worried about?
so im estimated to be done with my degree at most 6 years. . . I'm getting a lot of anxiety because I'm starting so late. .im starting 6 years late and its started to really upset me and im wondering if im doing the right thing or if there will be problems for me at all?by the time i start people my age would be starting or have started in the workforce so im already 6 years behind everyone else. . i know this is and will be in high demand but am i being paranoid or is there merit to my worry?
