I let my license expire for 4 months
I was due to have my license renewed in January but my state extended it until July due to the pandemic. Of course I took advantage of the extension but then July rolled around. I just let it go. They sent me a letter saying I would need to retake the driving test if I let it go for 6 months. That gave me enough anxiety to renew it right at the 4 month mark. I'm kind of sad I let that happen and I drove on an expired license due to my mental health. I am super proud of myself for getting myself into the bmv to renew it. I had a euphoric sense of accomplishment after I got it. It's kind of sad. I have body dysmorphic disorder involving my face so the picture portion of the visit is what kept me away so long.
