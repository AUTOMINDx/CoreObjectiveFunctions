Second Thanksgiving Where My Parents Were “Falling on the Ground Drunk”
Title pretty much sums it up- last Thanksgiving I spent with my parents they were so drunk they were falling on the ground. They were supposed to be spending the night at a relatives house with my kids who are teens and I told my oldest teen don’t get in the car with them at all- they are too drunk to drive, if they try to drive call me. My husband and I left to stay at a hotel and within 25 min got a call from my oldest son to please come pick them up grandma and grandpa are trying to drive with us. I left to get them and got a barrage of angry texts from my mom about how they would never hurt the kids, etc. I kind of ignored them and we never talked about it after that. 

Spent the next T with in-laws and this year  went back to my parents and again they were sloppy drunk, my mom ended up throwing all the leftovers into one bowl in a disgusting mess and wouldn’t let anyone try to help and my dad was falling over drunk. There were lots of other relatives too. 

My brother who is trying to stay sober didn’t come this year and told me it’s bc of the drinking and I’m thinking if I should do the same for Christmas and in future years. I hate my kids seeing them like this and don’t feel comfortable with them staying over with their grandparents.
