How do I socialize with my 3 year old niece?
I'm a 24(M) year old introvert who barely opens his mouth and says anything unless prompted to and I am staying with my very extroverted relatives whom I haven't been very close with lately. So, my cousin has a 3 year old daughter and being born and raised around extroverted people, she's always very playful, jumping and running in the house, always saying random things, etcetera.. you get the point.

So here comes the problem, most of the time during the day, I happen to be in the same room as my little niece, who's always jibber-jabbering about something, excited running around and her dad playing along with her and there I will be sitting on the couch quietly, just looking at them and smiling.

They try to involve me in their playful activities but me being the boring ass I am, can barely do or say anything interesting  to keep her entertained. 

It even went so far that she even started to say things like, "Nooo, I don't want mama (she calls me mama) to play". I know I shouldn't be taking a three year old's words very seriously but I clearly can see where she is coming from and I hate that I can not really do much about it.

I do want to hangout with my niece and be one of her favourite people as she grows up but I just do not know how to do it. I haven't been around kids much growing up, I can barely think of anything nice or interesting to say. Hell, I can't even say nice words like "good girl", "nice", "very good" although I almost always open my mouth to say it but couldn't just get it out (this maybe because I do not use these words in my life on a day to day basis and hence hard for me to get them out).

Has anyone else been in the same boat as me and if yes, how do you guys overcome it? Any suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks for reading :)
