What wrong with high waisted jeans?
Lmaooo it seems like men have a vendetta against them.  

We just don't want our buttcrack hanging out. In all honesty, I really wanna know why y'all don't like em. If there is an explanation or if it's just something you guys don't vibe with?

Edit: I'll keep wearing them no prob, I'm just curious.
