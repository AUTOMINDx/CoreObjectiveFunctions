I don't know what to do, I've lost the only person I can trust. I'm so lonely and have nobody to talk and relate to. I have zero friends, and I have really bad anxiety. I just want somebody to be here for me and notice me. I don't know anyone that I can connect with. I want a genuine friendship, please
