[The Matrix] Since the human forces download their fighting skills from the same source, would every fight against each other result in a stalemate?
I recognize that Morpheus beat Neo at the beginning, but that was training. If two fighters of even strength fought one another shouldn’t it always end in a stalemate since they’d be at the exact same skill level?
