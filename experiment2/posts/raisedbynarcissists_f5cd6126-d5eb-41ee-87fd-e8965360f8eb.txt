Insanely crying because my mom threw away my bunnies' pen and caged them while I was at school
She threw away the whole pen because they were pooping in the pen. Bunny poop, literally not smelly nor causing dirt.
She always does this, using my pets to hurt me but she never went this far..now I'm in the bathroom and my face is red, wet and swollen.

Update: so a bit before I arrived at the pet shop my mom sent me a link to a new pen. I told her I won't accept anything smaller + she wants the cage to stay(???) So since they didn't have nice pens at my pet shop I'll order one tomorrow. I currently have them roaming around my mom hates it but whatever.
