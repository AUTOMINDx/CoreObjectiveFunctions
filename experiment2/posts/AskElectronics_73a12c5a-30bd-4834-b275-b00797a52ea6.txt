Esoteric Nixie Tubes - How should I drive these?
Hi all, I have some weird Philips ZM1030 nixie tubes I'd love to get working for a clock project. Here's the datasheet:

They seem to require more voltage rails than typical nixies. I figured I could use 3 separate HV switching supplies to drive the three different high voltage rails without generating a ton of heat (via resistive voltage divider networks), so I built three of these:

My intent is to switch the numeral cathodes using one of those HV sink driver ICs made for VFDs and inkjet printheads. I saw them used this way here:

**My questions:**  


1.  **Is using 3 separate HV supplies a good idea?**  

2. **How should I hook the tubes up with respect to the HV sink driver and the supplies? A description/diagram showing the connections to one numeral from "group 1" and "group 2" would be super helpful.**

I'm more of digital guy, analog stuff still confuses me sometimes! Here's what the tubes look like when operating in the original machine, wheee:

Any help is appreciated!
