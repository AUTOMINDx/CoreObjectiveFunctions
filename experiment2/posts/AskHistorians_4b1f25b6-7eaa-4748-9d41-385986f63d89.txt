Investigating a Murder in 1670-1680 Germany by my 8x grandfather, where to start?
Hi all, 

I’m a historian, and for fun I googled my name in a search engine of our National Archive (I live in the Netherlands). I found a dossier in the archive with a note that my 8x great grandfather had supposedly committed a murder and Fled to the Amsterdam to escape. He was supposedly living in the area of Maagdenburg, Sachsen Anhalt, from 1656 to about 1676.

Would any of you know if it possible to trace at least this person back to Germany, how to start with German archives? And if this rumour of a murder was true, where could I find details of it? My country has digitised a lot of archives, but I can’t find this in Germany. 

Thanks a lot in advance!
