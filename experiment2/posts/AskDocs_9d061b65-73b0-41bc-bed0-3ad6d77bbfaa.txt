Why does it help my migraines to put pressure on my eyes? Is it safe to do that?
I do it when the pain gets unbearable, and only for some moments. Once I put the pressure on, the pain almost entirely fades away, and all I'm left with is a strange full feeling in my head. As soon as I take the pressure away, the pain fades back in, to as bad as it was. I'm mainly curious about the possible reasons this works, and if it's something I should even be doing.

For reference, I'm 20F, have chronic migraines and fibromyalgia, with a few things indicating something autoimmune might be going on.
