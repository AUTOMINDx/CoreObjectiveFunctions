Wife just found out her and her Sister were conceived via sperm donor
My wife (f/mid 30’s) just found out through Ancestry DNA testing that her father is not her bio-dad. Both of her mom and dad are deceased, and this was only confirmed via aunt and uncle (mother’s siblings). I have two things I’d like advice on:

1) I am conflicted in my feelings towards her aunt and uncle for not informing her once her mother passed. I sorta understand why her mother withheld the information (although I still think it was wrong), but I feel as though her aunt and uncle should have let her know instead of having to be surprised to not match with her half-siblings on ancestry. Is it reasonable to be upset towards them and possibly not speak to them or be way less friendly? I’m only seeking advice for myself, obviously my wife has her own agency and will make the choice for herself, but I kinda feel like not speaking to them regardless of how she feels. 

2) should my wife chose to pursue information about her bio-dad how can I help her find the resources she needs to do so? We essentially know nothing aside from the town where her mother lived 30+ years ago, and I have no idea where to begin. Again, I am only interested in advice for myself. I am not going to relay any of this information to her.
