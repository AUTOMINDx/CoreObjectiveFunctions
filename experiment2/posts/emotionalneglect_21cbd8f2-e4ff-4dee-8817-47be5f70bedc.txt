[Possible Trigger Warning] My mother blamed me when i had a fight the past week, it wasn't my fault
Last week monday, there was a fight in school (not physical but just some arguements but the other party was violent and would kick my table and chair) and afterwards, the other student's (who fought with me) parents wanted to talk with my mother and a few teachers.

Now, my mother kept telling me '[inserts her name] is so pitiful, she did that out of anger because she was depressed' even while knowing that I had suffered from depression since 11 (even younger than that). 

She kept saying 'You should stay obedient and tell that person sorry, you should've told them that you didn't have [this]'
