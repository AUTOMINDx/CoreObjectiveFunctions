Yellow stool
Does anyone have yellowish (sometimes orange) stools? I’ve had them everyday since february (occasionally with undigested particles as well) and for a few months that was kind of my only symptom besides bad breath, but for the last few days, I’ve been experiencing regurgitation and it feels like there’s a lump in my throat. These symptoms appear usually after eating and they last for 1-2 hours. 
My doctor prescribed famotidine and I’ve been taking them for a few weeks but nothing has changed…
I’m really scared of pancreatic cancer, I had two ultrasounds this year, both came out clear, but none of my doctors seem to take me seriously since I’m only 26 so they just assume it’s nothing serious.
Can GERD cause these weird stools?
