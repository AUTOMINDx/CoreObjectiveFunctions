Another transference post
I've been overly attached to my therapist pretty much the whole time I've been in therapy so far (&gt;one year). Sometimes I miss them so much between sessions and long for their attention and care. 

There's also a layer of doubting my relationship toward my therapist. That the connection in therapy is fake, that it's just him doing his job (which he rejects).

So I just realized that growing up it was like my dad was just "doing his job" being a parent. He took care of all the basic requirements but there was zero emotional attunement. No heart to heart conversations, no life lessons taught, no curiosity in getting to know me. He never said he cared about me or that he loved me.

This makes the longing for my therapist even more painful since it is literally their job. Realizing that I've felt more cared for by my therapist than my dad is heartbreaking. It was easier when I didn't know what I was missing.
