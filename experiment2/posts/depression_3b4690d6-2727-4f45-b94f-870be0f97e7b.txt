I'm depressed and I can't do this anymore
I recently realized that me being lazy and just not wanting to wake up had to do something with my metal health and now that I do,  I only feel worse.  I tried to commit suicide yesterday but from all the stupid posts id seen about asking for help,  I tried. I called the suicide helpline but they didn't pick up and decided to talk to my mom,  she said that I'm embarrassing her and it's just me being incompetent.  I don't know what to do, I don't really want to die but just the idea of having to wake up tomorrow and doing this again makes me want to do it.  I need advice on what I should do because I do want a life ahead of this
