My depression keeps getting worse
All throughout high school I thought I just had really bad anxiety and I was on some meds for it. I stopped taking the meds, don’t ask why I couldn’t tell you. I did therapy a little this summer. But now due to living out of my home state I can’t get therapy or meds easily. My depression just keeps getting worse and no one understands. My boyfriend doesn’t understand or know how to help me, my parents never understood, I don’t have really close friends anymore that I can talk to, and I don’t know what to do. I’m really scared I’m going to hurt myself or even kill myself. I don’t want to die because I know my life has so much potential. But it gets worse everyday and never seems to get better. I was managing it for a while but recently nothing seems to help. I stopped doing my hobbies about seven months ago and I can’t focus or even bring myself to care about my classes. I smoke and it helps, but it’s not a cure. I just want to feel any amount of better. I’m so alone and scared.
