Suggestion?
New to life here. After fighting a crapload of legal battles that were over absolutely nothing but stupidity that shouldn’t’ve ever happened in the first place, I’m ready to start doing shit! Over 3 years late, but at least shit’s happening now.
19 years old now (regretfully) and never cared to write a resume or even learn how to do so because tge legal shit going on was anything but promising to let me live, ever.

I’ve 5 years experience as a self-trained mechanic, I grew up on a farm and voluntarily spent 18 hours a day, 7 days a week for almost a solid 6 month in my grandpa’s machine shop so I’ve plenty of experience there, I’ve a good bit of experience operating machinery, basically if it had a throttle I can operate it. I can patch a tire in just a few minutes (most of the time spent in that fir me is jacking the vehcle up, removing the wheel, letting the pressure out of the tire, and waiting on the patch cement to dry. 
Generally speaking, if it has a throttle I can work on it as well.
I also like occasionally messing around with computers and the Linux operating systems, but I ain’t real good at writing code yet, as it’s just an occasional hobby of mine.
How would one write such as a resume?
