How do I ask a guy I barely know out?
I met him in class and I think he is really cute and funny, but I have no idea how to ask him out.

He is younger than me and we share only two subjects, we talked a little and he was nice. I followed him on instagram and he instantly followed me back, but I don’t really have any excuse to go talk to him and he is always surrounded by his friends. I kinda had a bad experience asking a guy out before and I don’t want it to happen again, so I don’t know how to show interest without creeping him out and being rejected.
Any good advice on what should I do or how would you like to be approached?
