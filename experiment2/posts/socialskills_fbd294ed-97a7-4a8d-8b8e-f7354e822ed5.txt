How to stop giving unsolicited advice and over sharing thoughts
I don't want things to go wrong. I know that I know stuff so I'm always trying to share what I know with others so that I can help them. I know that if i was this person I would want to know about this interesting fact that is gonna help me a lot, so I share it with them. The problem is that this is making me an annoying person.
I'm always around people, trying to figure out what they want and what should they do in order to achieve it. I overshare thoughts. I give my opinion on everything, even when it's not appropriate. I can't help but correct every mistake pepple do..I always tell them what to do and what to not do. I'm that annoying person who gives you advice when you didn't ask for it. 
How can I stop being that person? Because I don't want to be annoying, I just want to help. I literally feel like an asshole if I didn't share my knowledge with everyone. I don't want to stop and stay silent when things go wrong while I KNOW how to make them go right.
