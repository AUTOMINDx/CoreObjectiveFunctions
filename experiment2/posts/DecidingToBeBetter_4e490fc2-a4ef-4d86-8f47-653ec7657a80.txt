Cutting down on sugar
Throughout my life I have been literally addicted to sugar. It all stemmed from being restricted suagry foods as a kid and when I moved out of my household I started eating a lot of junk food that contained a high level of sugar. Honestly I never really seen it as a problem because yknow, live a little.

Over the years I have noticed that I get withdraws without sugar (fuck, I know it sounds ridiculous but that's the only thing I can call them). I get severe headaches, my body will start to shake, I get severely irritated, I feel drained, I feel hungry even if I have just eaten. I never thought a sugar addiction was a real thing but it turns out it is. 

It only dawned on me a couple of months ago that I moved out of my mums house 6 years ago and I am still eating as much sugar as I did when I initially moved out. Its actually become somewhat worse because I have only recently been informed of how much sugar is in EVERYTHING. Processed foods, sauces, bread etc. I was (and still am) in shock. 

So I have decided that I am going to gradually cut down on my sugar intake and start being more mindful about the foods I eat. Diabetes runs in my family and if changing my diet is something I can do to prevent it, that's a compromise I'm willing to take. I started cutting down already and it's been a tough few days but I'm ready to commit to making this change, it's been too long since I properly cared for my body.  Wish me luck!
