Did Japanese soldiers in WW2 wear stolen US uniforms to infiltrate US lines?
I saw an interview with a vet who said on Pelielu, they were sitting cooking and a tiny guy walked past holding up a crate to hide his face. His uniform was also way too big, so it looked odd. They called out, and the guy started running â€“ and 50 marines shot at him. In happened in front of Chesty Puller's field HQ. No doubt the Japanese soldier was trying to toss grenades in HQ.

Was this practice widespread by Japan? Are there any sources you know of? Or other anecdotes by veterans?
