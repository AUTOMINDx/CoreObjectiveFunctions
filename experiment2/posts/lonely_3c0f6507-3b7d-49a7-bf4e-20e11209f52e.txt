How, just HOW TF
(M19) I've been trying to get over this feeling for a while, like, about 2 years. I've been trying to forget about my best friend (F) who left me cuz she found new friends...
First I tried to see her as a normal girl that I know, just a very normal friend but I couldn't, I still have the feeling like I am responsible for her, like I need to be there for her when shes sad etc etc. now its been like 2 months that I haven't texted her and even archived her chat so wouldn't randomly see it.
But it doesn't work, I dont think about her like I used to do anymore but this feeling of loneliness is killing me, I have other friends, good friends, but idk why I cant just stick to them like I've been so connected to her in the past 6 years that I almost forgot about my other friends.
Idk wth am I even talking about rn im just spitting whatever comes to my mind, prolly no one would read this anyway
