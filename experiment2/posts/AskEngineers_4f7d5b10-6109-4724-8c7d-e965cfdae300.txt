Is MET worth the investment?
I’m currently a BSME student planning on switching to BSMET. I want to work in manufacturing in one capacity or another and this kind of degree was a direct path to it, with the money being an added bonus. I’m aware that MET will typically make less than an ME, but is the pay still decent or is it a degree that is considered underpaid?
