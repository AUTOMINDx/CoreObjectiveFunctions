Did the literate folks in medieval have individual names memorized for all or most days of the year? Could you refer to events as happening on any Saint's feast day and expect to be understood?
Barbara Tuchman mentions that dating events as "Two days before the nativity of the virgin, or the Monday after epiphany, or St. John the Baptist's day, or the third Sunday in Lent."

Did they do this because it was actually understandable, or because they wanted to put things in religious context?
