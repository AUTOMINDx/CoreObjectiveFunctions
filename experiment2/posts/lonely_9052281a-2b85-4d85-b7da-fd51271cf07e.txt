People are assholes
People judge me on how I act 
People judge me on how I talk
People judge me on how I dress

I have a stutter and ever since middle school I’ve been getting bullied for it. I’ve had many time that I wanted to end it. But now all I do is sit in a corner and cry. At my high school there was a girl I liked and I would somewhat stare at her. One day she saw me staring at her and looked discussed. After the period was over she started blaming to her friends calling me a stalker and pedophile. It quickly got its way around the school and everybody was staying away from me calling me a peace of shit. Well one day I had enough and decided that I would address the rumors so I did but no believed me. It was like I was some sort of monster. 
That’s all I’m going to put because I’m literally crying and can’t take it anymore.
