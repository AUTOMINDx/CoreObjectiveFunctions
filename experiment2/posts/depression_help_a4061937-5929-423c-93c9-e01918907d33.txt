How to pull yourself out of a depressive episode?
how do u pull out of a depressive episode?? Itâ€™s been a week since I got home, I got arrested and went to jail for 19 days and lost my job by leaving, and Iâ€™ve just been locked in my room laying in bed all week anxious and sad completely avoiding the world. I canâ€™t get myself to even make an appointment let alone start calling for job interviews. Idk whatâ€™s wrong with me. My savings are dwindling and my rent is due on the 1st but I donâ€™t have nearly enough to pay it. Iâ€™m gonna have to give my last months notice if I donâ€™t get my shit together. I havenâ€™t showered in like 4 days, my dirty laundry is a mountain, my room is messy, and all I can do is justâ€¦ sit here. And worry. At my last job I was so beyond stressed out and was actually about to go into inpatient mental health treatment (psych ward) but I got arrested off a warrant Iâ€™ve had since 2019 that I had no idea about first before I could admit myself. I feel.. defeated. Because I canâ€™t pay my rent here I might have to go back to my toxic exâ€™s house to live since I know rent wonâ€™t be a worry until I get on my feet. But my ex used drugs and Iâ€™m pretty sure he still does so Iâ€™m scared to go there but I feel like I have no other choice since I canâ€™t pay my rent. Is there any mental facilities I could go to long term for help? Iâ€™m so lost and scared. Iâ€™m in Massachusetts and donâ€™t know what my options are â€¦ ðŸ¥º
