Does anyone else use self harm as a form of punishment TW: self harm and physical abuse
My father was very physically violent when I was a kid. He would usually smack me in the back of my head as a form of discipline and whenever I cried he would tell to stop or he would "give me something to cry about" which was usually him hitting me harder.

Along with my parents some teachers I had were extremely abusive and would lock me in a small room where they stored toys and other stuff (I was in a asd classroom) where they would keep me in until I stopped trying to get out or they had to take me back to the classroom.

After that I went middle school where I continued to get lock in rooms and in middle school I got put in a room they called the "panic room" which you can't open from the inside and had patting all over the walls.

The consent locking me in rooms ended when I went to high school but at the point the got to high school I found it hard to trust others and would start to have panic attacks whenever I would be in a space where I had a hard time moving around and would start trying to break out of wherever I was.

Luckily recently I was able to get help from a social worker and I started coming up with a plan to escape my parents and count them out of my life forever.   

But recently I've noticed that whenever I screw up in some way I would punch myself in the jaw or would slash at my arms and legs while I tell myself that I screwed up and I had deal with the consequences of my actions and endure the pain because I shouldn't have messed up in the first place.

Sorry for the long post I just hope I gave as much context I could.
