I'll live and die alone, being a complete failure
I'm 23 years old man, and I have no real friends neither virtual friends (besides, what even makes you consider someone your friend? I've never felt I've had any real friends since I was a child). My ex-girlfriend was the only woman I've ever met that felt any interest in me, and now she's gone. I've lost her and I'll never find anyone else. 

I mean, just look at me. I have no social skills, I am ugly, I am too tall (2.05m) and obese (153kg at the moment), I have scoliosis, I am going bald, I use glasses, my beard sucks (and my face looks even worse without it), my hair never is looking good... 

I am now trying to accept the fact that my miserable and pathetic life will be spent alone. I don't have the skills, will, beauty or cash to find anyone who wants me.
