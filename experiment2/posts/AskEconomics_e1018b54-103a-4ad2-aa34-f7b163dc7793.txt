From an Economics point of view, how true is the CRT claim that color blind policies has lead to economic inequality of black people?
I am from India, so neither black or white. So, if I understand this correctly, black people in USA as a group is economically disadvantaged, in the sense they are generally poor and live in 'black communities'. To explain this, there are two theories: conservative theory of laziness and liberal theory of CRT.

Conservative theory, held by Repubs and propounded by people like Thomas Sowell, says that this inequality is because black people in general are lazy and don't wanna work hard enough. Iirc, the idea is also that govt affirmative action has made them dependent on govt programmes and lazy. 'Black culture', which consists of drugs, raves, hip hop, etc. is also blamed by people like Sowell, saying that it leads to low productivity and corruption. 

The CRT, apparently very popular in US among Social Science students, says that color blind policies are to blame and pushes for more affirmative action or, as they call it, 'race-conscious' programmes for the upliftment of black people from poverty. As per Wiki of CRT, they oppose classical liberal policy of 'equality of opportunity', which Sowell was for and say such policies has lead to more racism and more poor people in black community.

From an Economics perspective, how true is CRT? Are black people poor because 'they are lazy' or because they are 'victims of color-blind policies'?
