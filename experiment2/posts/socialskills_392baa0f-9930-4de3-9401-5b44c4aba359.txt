Expanding your social circle
**Building a social circle and putting yourself out there**

This is a guide on expanding your social circle. If you're introverted with low to minimal social skills, I suggest you read up on other social material elsewhere before you dive into this.

* If you get invited to a social event, meet as many people as you can, show them your personality and have an interesting conversation. Get their socials and stay in touch. The more people you know and casually talk to, the more likely they are to invite you to a social event and also meet people that can be your good friends.
* Throw your own social event or share your invites with other people.
* If people are busy, keep showing interest until they eventually wanna hang out.  Keep sharing until you see disinterest or say no multiple times. Gauge interest and reciprocate it. Double down on the people that are interested but don’t be too clingy.
* If you are the person that shares social invites, chances are you will be invited to the next thing. If you are not invited to the next thing and that’s okay.
* After a social hangout, individually message all the people you got a chance to talk to and you liked. Just say sth like “Super nice meeting you yesterday, we should grab drinks sometimes”. This shows genuine interest and can set the tone for future interactions. They might or might not show interest, and that’s okay.
* Follow them on Instagram. Reply casually to their Instas stories and have a quick chat, message them every few months here to check-in.
* Fake it till you make it. Pretend you are very social at a party and talk to as many people as you can. Don't be scared of rejection when you invite people to social events or talk to them at a social event, it happens all the time. Keep going until you are able to earn from compound returns.
* Don’t say no to more than 2 invites in a row- it takes &gt; 3 cancellations for people to stop inviting you over.
* Keep exercising the social muscles until you practice them like art.
* Ask them out of a bunch of drinks next time. When you do this, you're able to meet them and deepen the relationship as a meeting that is not loud and rowdy like a party.

When you do put yourself out there, you end up making new friends that you can rely on overtime to give you more opportunities for social interactions, and hence, eventually expand your social circle.  Talk to as many people as you can and put yourself in as amnesty socialism situations as you can.

You can also build and nurture new relationships with the people you vibe well with and eventually form a new friend group with the people you think will get along well. This might seem hard but it has worked well for me in the past and I would love to keep doing it and share feedback and what works for you.
