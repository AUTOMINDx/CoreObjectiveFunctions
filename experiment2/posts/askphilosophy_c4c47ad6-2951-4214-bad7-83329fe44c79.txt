About intuition in Kant. Does it includes memory of an object? Or only what is accessible while experiencing it?
Pretty much the question. I'm just start reading CPR and I was wandering if intuition is something that relates only to the immediate result of sensation or if it is something that we are able to retain? Because it seems that we can never, no matter how carefully we observe it, retain all the details of what we experience.

But if that is the case, what are the mental pictures of objects that I can remember? Even though I cannot remember all the details, we can remember them in such detail that, in a dream, for example, we can even be fooled into thinking we are experiencing it. Are they thoughts maybe? or concepts?
