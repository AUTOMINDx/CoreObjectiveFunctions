Masters of mechanical engineering only and PE licensure
Reddit Engineers,

I am preparing to transition from my current profession (medical doctor) into engineering. I have several opportunities to register for a direct masters in mechanical engineering (where I will take prerequisites in a preliminary year or less). My reason for a masters is a desire to be surrounded by other students closer to my age and the potentially shorter duration and lower cost of the degree.

However, it seems some states have the Beng as a prerequisite to registering for PE licensure. I hope to live in many more countries later, and may encounter something similar elsewhere. To what extent would getting a masters only inhibit my ability to fully and independently practice as a licensed engineer?

Cheers,

C-Ptolemy.
