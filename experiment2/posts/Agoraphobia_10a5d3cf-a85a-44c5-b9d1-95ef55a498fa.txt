When is it over
The worst thing about all of this is I will never be my old self again. Nobody around me understands and they get upset and sometimes mad when I “can’t” do something or go somewhere, likes it’s my fault. I’m trying, I’m trying my best I’m just so tired at this point I don’t want to do anything anymore. When does it stop? When could I be who I used to be. Why me. Everything I try ends up not working, it’s been months of hell I don’t want to do this anymore.
