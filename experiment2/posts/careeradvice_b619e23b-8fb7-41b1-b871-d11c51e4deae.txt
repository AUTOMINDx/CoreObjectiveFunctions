Should I continue to study pharmacy
I am a second-year pharmacy student located in Australia, I have been thinking if I should quit pharmacy and study something else, the reason being pharmacists in Australia don't generally make a lot of money, even the MOST experienced pharmacist (manager level) make around 38 to a maximum of 40 dollars/hr that's around 80k a year and I don't think its really worth the amount of work and study, I know people that do commerce and Comp sci degrees that are able to make over 100k after a few years in their profession. with an Asian immigrant background, I get a lot of pressure from the family to do well financially and rightly so because my family has given up a lot for my education. i don't mind studying pharmacy, i dislike business and commerce, but i am just seriously wondering if i should switch my degree to commerce or some other field in healthcare. 

any advice would be appreciated.
