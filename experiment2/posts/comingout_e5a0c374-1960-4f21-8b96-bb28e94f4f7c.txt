i did it o:
After 4-something years of built up anxiety, I, 16(M), finally managed to come out to my mum!  
I made a post here yesterday asking for advice, and I decided that today would be the day, so I waited for the correct moment and did it!  
Just wanted to share this really, I haven't been this happy/relieved in idk how long &gt;\~&lt;.  


She also seemed supportive of me being into crossdress, so my dreams of being femboy are now closer than ever! &gt;w&lt;
