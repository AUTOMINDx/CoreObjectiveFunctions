Favorable work schedule for a growing family? 7on-7off vs 4x10’s?
Hi everyone..hopefully third time is the charm since this didn’t get approved in two other subreddits…I work in healthcare and was wanting to see if I could some great input from a variety of professionals. 

Just curious what everyone’s thoughts are on work schedules, between 7 on, 7 off vs. 4x10’s. I currently work day shift and am actively searching for a different position due some manager and support-related issues. While one of the positions is closer to my additional training, I’m more interested in what’s best for my family.

7 on 7 off — Tues-Mon. second shift hours *not* third shift, roughly 1pm to midnight

4x10’s — second shift, no weekends. Four consecutive days during Mon-Fri. Rough shift start btw 2-4pm to midnight-2am

I have a young family and am concerned about when the kids get older if the 7 day day stretch and every other weekend will be too restrictive. Since I currently don’t do any traveling, I feel like the 7 days off perk is kind of wasted.

With the 4x10’s there will often be three day weekends off. 

Any comments from the more experienced folk in what has/hasn’t worked for you and your family?
