Left lung pain
For the past 6 days I had a sore throat and coughing up a lot of mucus. I even coughed so hard that I vomited, it was weird. Today my throat does not hurt but I have a tickle in my throat. I am not coughing as much either. I went to a walk in when I first had this cold and I was negative for Covid, strep, and bronchitis. I never had a fever during this and I do not today.  I don’t feel dizzy or have a headache.  My complaints have been throat pain, cough, and now left chest discomfort.  So that means what I have is a cold and it will go away on its own?

Also when I was coughing a lot and sometimes with a hard force, I think I injured my left lung or left rib. I constantly feel a pain in my left side and if I take a deep breath or cough the pain will hurt worse. The pain is worse when laying down and sleeping is tough sometimes.

Did I injure my lung or rib from coughing too hard? I noticed the pain right after I had an episode of coughing and hacking hard. I don’t feel lightheaded or anything and I feel I’m getting enough oxygen when I breathe. Is this just an injury that heals itself in a week or maybe a month? Is this normal or did I do something and need medical attention? It sucks being in pain like this and if I ever have to cough I brace my left lung to try to help the pain. I still cough up some mucus too but not as much. I have had this pain/injury for a day or two.

Thank you for the help!

I am 33 years old and not a smoke, never was a smoker.  My height is 5”10” and weight is 160 lbs.  I am male and I do not take any medications.  I never had this medical issue previously where I noticed my left lung/rib/chest was hurt from coughing really hard.
