I’mhaving a panic attack right now
I don’t know what to do. My mouth feels too dry it’s hard to breath and I’m burping excessively which makes it hard to get a breath. It’s been going on for many minutes maybe at least 10-15. I just need some reassurance or something

Edit: thanks all for the comments, they did really help as I often feel so isolated and lost during my panic attacks. This is the first time I reached out online to others during an episode as I really didn’t know what else to do.

I think it is pretty much over now. But at the height of it I was considering calling an ambulance or something because of how unstable I was.
