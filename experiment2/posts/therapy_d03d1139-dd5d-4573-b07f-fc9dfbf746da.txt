I’m stuck in life
I’m in this moment of monotony in my life where I feel glued in my ways. I want to go on little adventures and have a career where I’m comfortable enough to pay my bills and try out all these classes and activities you see on ads. I’m 22 and still living with my parents while working a part time job that’s pointless. At this point I’m venting about the simplistic dissatisfaction I have with my life and how I’m glued to the responsibilities of home while dreaming of exploration. I just want to know I’m not alone in this sensation
