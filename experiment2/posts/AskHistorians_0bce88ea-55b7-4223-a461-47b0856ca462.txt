What historical contexts, if any, led to opposition to same-sex romantic and sexual behavior in the Abrahamic religions?
I know very little about religion, theology, or religious history, nor do I know much about the specific teachings or scriptures of any modern descendant or branches of the three Abrahamic religions (namely Christianity, Judaism, and Islam). However, I do know that most religious followings belonging to these groups have negative views on LGBTQ+ people, and specific teachings against same-sex romantic and sexual behaviors listed in their holy texts and taught in their faiths, at least in the current era.

Are their any historical reasons why all three major branches of the Abrahamic religions and their offshoots regard same-sex behavior as wrong? Either from when they were first forming and their holy texts were first being by written in ancient times, or from later subsequent events in history that caused these views to develop?
