I also tired of feeling alone
I am feeling sick down. I don't talk to anyone other than my wife (thats even rare) I am currently unemployed, other than looking for a job I play video games and just sit here. My wife has all these friends and she has lunches and events and she gets upset when I tell her I feel alone. I don't want to make her feel bad because she deserves to have a social life. But literally my family is all gone and I just wish I had someone nearby to talk to. I honestly hate my life and I really don't say that lightly. With my struggles with depression and not working and just overall feeling like a failure, I am seriously tempted to just say to hell with this life. I mean honestly with no friends, no job, who the fuck would care and atleast there would be some social security income for my wife (until it goes away) I'm worth more gone than here. Anyway just felt like I needed to say something to someone....well everyone thank you
