Throat tightness
Has anyone experienced throat tightness/tension from the reflux?

I experience it everyday pretty much. My actual reflux stopped like 3 months ago, get slight stinging in my stomach sometimes but not often at all anymore just burping.

The throat tightness is the biggest thing for me, if I feel the left side of my throat (below adams apple but where cartilage is), it feels a bit like as if its internally inflamed and it feels hard sometimes. It's been a few months since my last reflux flareup though, still on lansoprazole but my doc is looking to get me off it in a month and the throat issues are still there. I don't know what to do.

Anyone else had this or have any advice?
