Help can't sleep
Its been about a week since I had a decent sleep. I've been thinking about everything n how life can throw so much cramp at you. And the only thing I want to do is run to.y exes even though I know I will regret. I miss sleeping with my master's shirt and the ones that I had left well ran ought of his scent and now I can't sleep. Help like I really want to just sleep
