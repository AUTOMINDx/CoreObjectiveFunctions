Thank you to everyone who posts here!
I have spent the past hour or so reading the recents posts here, and with relief it helped me realise that I have been in a 2 month long cPTSD episode/spiral. Like to the point I was not at all grounded and had totally accepted that I was unreperabbly, worthlessly broken and rotten to my core. I became   embroiled in severe social paranoia, nightmares, depression and anxiety. I failed out of my semester because of it. 

But all of your bravery in sharing gave me perspective again. I finally don't feel enmeshed with the toxic shame that has been choking me for two months. I can see that these feelings and thoughts I've been having aren't real - they are symptoms of cPTSD. Because so many of you write things I could have written. And there's nothing wrong with any of you, I can see so clearly that your suffering from a real disease that is a *reasonable and biological response to what you have been through.*  

So I am not wrong either, because it's the same for me! 

A stupid, obvious realisation perhaps, but I'm sure you guys know it's not when the cPTSD takes over. 

I know it's bittersweet, but I can breathe a little easier for the first time in a long time just because you guys took the time to share your similar struggles. 

I am a grateful for our solidarity. Thank you. I cannot express how thankful I am for all of you for recognising and sharing. You are helping us.
