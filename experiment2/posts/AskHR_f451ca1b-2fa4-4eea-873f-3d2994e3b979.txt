[IL] Health concerns in the workplace
So this doesn't concern me, but my mother in law. 

She works for the state in Illinois and has for quite awhile. She has Lupus (an autoimmune disorder), and is scared to get the covid vaccine because of it. Just yesterday, she found out multiple people at her place of work have gotten confirmed cases of covid, and that her boss is not sending them home and is allowing them to continue coming into work.

 She is now extremely fearful for her life and is scared to come back to work since she doesn't have the vaccine and she is immunocompromised. She's worried she is going to be unable to continue working because of this. So I ask you, is there anything her workplace can do or any compensation they can give her? Returning to work at the moment would be a severe endangerment to her health. Is there anything that can be done?

Thank you for your time!
