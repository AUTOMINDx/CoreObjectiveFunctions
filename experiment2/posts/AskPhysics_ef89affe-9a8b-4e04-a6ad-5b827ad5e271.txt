Is there a name for this "phenomenon" of light reflection?
Hey everyone! I was wondering if there was a technical term for this phenomenon: When you move relative to a spot of reflected light on a surface, the reflected light seems to be moving "with you", that is: It seems to move across the reflective surface in your direction of travel (see my amateurish video example below). Is there a specific name for this phenomenon?  I would be grateful for your help!
