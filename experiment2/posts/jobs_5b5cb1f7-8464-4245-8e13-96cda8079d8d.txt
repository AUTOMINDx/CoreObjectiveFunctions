Did I get scammed??
I am 16 years old, and yesterday I got hired to my first job. The manager of Taco Bell called me the morning after the night I sent an online application, and told me I was hired and there were some forms I needed to fill out in my email. I filled out an I-9, a W4, and signed a bunch of agreements and requirements for the job like dress code. The same manager who called me texted me asking for my ssn and and ID, which I gave without much hesitation. After thinking about it and looking at the messages, my boss used pretty broken english such as using the singular letter “u” in place of “you”. I don’t really know how this could have been a scam other than that but I am worried about my identity being stolen, even though I’m 16 I know they can’t do much.



Edit: I think it turned out to be legit, even though it was sketchy. I just called the store and one of the other managers confirmed that it was the right person and that I wasn’t scammed. They told me that she was on vacation before I mentioned it, which is something she also told me on call.
