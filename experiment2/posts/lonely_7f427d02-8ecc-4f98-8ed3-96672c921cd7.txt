I’ve destroyed myself
I’ve just decided whether consciously or subconsciously to give up on myself in life. I constantly feel useless and feel that I can’t do anything right. Most days I have to fight the urges I have to end my life. Every time I take one step forward in improving my life it feels like I take ten steps back. I hate my every birthday cause I feel I like I haven’t achieved anything in life and there is nothing to look forward. I never have hopes of my life getting better but I know it can always get worse somehow. 26M.
