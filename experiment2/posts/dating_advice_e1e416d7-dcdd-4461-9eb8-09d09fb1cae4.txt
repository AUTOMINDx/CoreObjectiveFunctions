Engagement Ring
My girlfriend and I have been dating for 9 years and we recently just graduated college. We’ve been going out since freshman year in high school and now that I have a full time job, I feel like it’s time for a proposal. I live in the New Jersey area and wanted to know if anyone had recommendations on where I should buy a ring. I looked at Key jewelers and  all those known jewelry stores, however, their prices are very high compared to a couple of non know jewelry stores. My brother in law bought his ring for 10k and that similar ring was going for 16k at Key Jewelers. Anyone have recommendations? If so, it would be a lot of help!
