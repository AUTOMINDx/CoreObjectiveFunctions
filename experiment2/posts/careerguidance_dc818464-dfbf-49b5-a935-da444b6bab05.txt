What opportunities do you see in YOUR field for a career as a writer?
Hello everyone, thanks for reading! I'm currently working as a freelance content and copywriter, picking up gigs from Upwork. Essentially, I'm trying to plan out long-term career aspirations so I can choose a niche to focus on. In YOUR field, where do you see writers making good money?

I want to use my talent for writing and editing to transition into a lucrative career. That being said, I understand that every industry has its own ins and outs that present unique jobs. I am not looking for a particular type of writing job, in fact, I want unexpected answers! I'm looking for careers that are more interesting than writing endless blog posts to drive traffic to someone's struggling website. In other words, I don't care if it's marketing-related at all. I might prefer otherwise!

If you want to take it into consideration, here's a quick rundown of my experience:

Content: Newsletters, blog posts, entire website content, landing pages, press releases, social media posts

Industries: Finance (tech, content creators, journalism), nootropic supplements, professional training (job-specific and general leadership), residential and commercial damage restoration, music journalism, jewelry,  and more.

Like I mentioned previously, I am looking for answers tailored to YOUR specific industry, not me or my experience. I'm looking to take my talent in a different direction.

Thanks!

EDIT: I'm asking this question from and for the United States! I wasn't sure whether to use the "advice" or "location" flair.
