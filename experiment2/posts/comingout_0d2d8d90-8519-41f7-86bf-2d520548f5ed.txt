I’m planning on coming out to my mother Thursday and I need some advice. I’m in high school and I’ve been talking to my counselor on how I should do it, and how I always chicken out when I try to, so she suggested that my mom can come in and we can talk about it in her office. (More in comments)
That way if she has questions she can get an adults and Mothers opinion on it (since my counselor is open-minded and a mother) and I really like that idea. I’m not sure how much my mom understands non-binary people that much and They/Them pronouns but she does have LGBTQ friends (which I know doesn’t automatically make you supportive but it gives me hope) so I don’t know how well she will take to me being Non-binary and changing my name. Any tips on what I should say, or question I should ask or be prepared to answer. I’d like to have an idea of what I’m getting into so I can get my point across to my mom without confusing her. (Btw I’m not worried about it being a non safe environment for me if I come out, she’s supportive of me being bi so I don’t worry too much she’s also never been negative about the LGBTQ community and she has had opportunities where someone who is homophobic should show it) sorry I know that was long.
