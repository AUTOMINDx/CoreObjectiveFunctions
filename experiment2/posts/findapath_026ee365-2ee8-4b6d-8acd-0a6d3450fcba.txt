Having mixed emotions
HS senior going to college. I
Right now my current plan is I’m going to community college for criminal justice and becoming a trooper. I love criminal work,  I want to work my way up the pole to be in the homicide detective unit. But then in the back of my mind,  is cars. I LOVE CARS. No,  I don’t like the mechanics of them,  I like the design,  the companies,  the technology of cars. For example,  I love Mazda. Is there anything I could do maybe to be a tech person in Mazda? Represent them? I also am great with photography,  is there a job for like taking pictures of cars for a car company?
