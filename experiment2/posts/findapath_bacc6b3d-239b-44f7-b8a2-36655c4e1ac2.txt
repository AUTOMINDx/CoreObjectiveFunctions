High school business teacher needing advice switching careers
I am currently in my fourth year as a high school business teacher in Kansas City, Missouri and have started to consider a career outside of teaching in the business or finance field. My reasons are typical for a teacher wanting to switch careers: burnout, bad-to-average pay (\~$60k), and high workload. Another thing is that, if I'm being honest, I just can't see myself working with children for the next 20-25 years. I LOVE the content I teach, especially personal finance, but I feel like I'm wasting that passion on being a teacher. I know I can tough it out now, but will eventually be miserable. I just turned 30 and am having my first kid next year. This has already motivated me to seek a profession I enjoy that has a higher salary and more advancement opportunities.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in General Business with a marketing minor from a decent school, a Master's in Sports Management (earned while I was a graduate assistant football coach), and a Master of Arts in Teaching. I can't give a specific career path I would want to take, but have been looking into careers like financial analyst, underwriter, and loan officer. I want to avoid any type of sales as much as possible.

I am just seeking any type of advice from people that work in the business/finance world. I know that a general business degree along with zero business-related work experience doesn't initially make me the most attractive candidate. I have been researching online MBA programs in Missouri, where I live.  That seems like a solid next step? What careers right now would be relatively easy or natural to transition to?
