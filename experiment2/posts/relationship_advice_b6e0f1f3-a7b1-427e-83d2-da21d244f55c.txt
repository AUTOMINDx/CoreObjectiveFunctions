I’m becoming obsessive and I want it to stop.
Some background information: my boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and have been dating for a bit over a year. We have met several times in that year.

I am a very jealous person. Not the type of person who would tell their partner not to talk to other people or anything like that. My boyfriend interacts with many people, especially online, and I would never get the idea to tell him to stop. But still, whenever I see he’s spending time with others while knowing I couldn’t give him those times, something in me starts feeling weird. I absolutely hate myself for that, because I know it’s a very unhealthy feeling. Seeing my partner being happy in social situations should make me feel happy as well, but it often doesn’t. I am more of an introvert and I figured out that making friends is not for me. I can’t keep up many relationships at once, and even though that bothers me sometimes, I have accepted that’s just who I am. My boyfriend, aside from my family, is basically the only person I constantly have around, even when it’s just online. I sometimes meet old friends, but usually only for a few hours and less than once a month. Therefore, my partner is very present in my head all the time. Which doesn’t have to be a bad thing in my opinion, since it shows that the relationship and him mean a lot to me. But I know that his way of approaching us is healthier. He loves me, texts me frequently, and I know he thinks of me as well. But at the same time, he can enjoy other things. I struggle with that, he’s become the thing that makes me by far the happiest, so other things I enjoy don’t seem nearly as fun as they used to before I was dating him. I don’t want to be obsessed with him, or jealous of the way he lives. Does anyone have advice on how to get out of this again?
Thank you in advance!
