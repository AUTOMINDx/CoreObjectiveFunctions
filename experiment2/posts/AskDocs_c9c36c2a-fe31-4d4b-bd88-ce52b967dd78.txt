Question about my daughter from an anxious mom
This question is regarding my 11 year old daughter. She is 4ft 11 inches, 145 lbs. No known health problems other than she is obese for her age. She put on more weight than I realized in the last year and a half during pandemic times. My husband and I are working to make it a family thing to make healthier choices. We have all been eating much less sugar, going for family walks, etc. And following various recommendations from her pediatrocian. I do feel really guilty about her weight, but that's not what my question is about. 

A couple of times lately, when she's walking or running around the house with her siblings, she will suddenly stop and say her leg hurts. Last time she said "Owww, I was just walking, why does my leg hurt?" 

This has only happened twice that I'm aware of. I asked her to let me know if it happens again. She said it went away quickly when it happened. When I asked about where exactly it hurt she pointed to an area just below her knee and an area right above her ankle. Both on the front of her leg. 

I struggle with anxiety, especially health anxiety, and that carries over into worrying about my kids. I am trying not to make a big deal out of it because I've been known to make her anxious in the past from asking too many questions. My brain is jumping to horrible scenarios like bone cancer or leukemia or something. 

From what I've described, is there something completely benign or way less serious than cancer that could cause this? I probably sound ridiculous, but alas, anxiety.
