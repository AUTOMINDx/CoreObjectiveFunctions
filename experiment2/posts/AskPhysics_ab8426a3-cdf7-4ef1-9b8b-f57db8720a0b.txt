Couple questions from a newbie
Hey smart peeps,

I am an undergrad engineering student, so please excuse me lol. But I never got a straight answer from a TA on these two questions and I still curious. 

How are magnets produced? I understand that certain materials have poles, but WHAT caused that to happen in the first place? Is it the poles of the earth? If so, would they be neutral in a vacuum?

Also, how are photons involved in EMF waves? I learned that light comes from Electromagnetic waves, which really confuses me because these waves describe the magnetic and electric fluxes, and I thought that light was its own particle, the photon. Where do photons come in? 

I wish my class load wasn't so heavy, cuz I REALLY enjoy learning concepts in physics. Doing the homework is annoying when I don't have time to struggle through it, and I am forced to look up answers. But, when I don't have other things to do, I love trying to solve problems in different ways. It is actually super creative and interactive :)
