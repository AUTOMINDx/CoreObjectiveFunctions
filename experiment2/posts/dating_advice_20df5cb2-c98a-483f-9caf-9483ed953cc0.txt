I lost my "flirty" touch ?
Hi, I (20M) seem to have lost my way with girls. Prepandemic, I didn't have any trouble being flirty or having genuine conversations with girls in hopes of getting a date (or some) but recently, I've been facing some problems in that area.

I've always been the kind of funny and flirty guy that some girls like, but since the recent pandemic, I seem to not be able to keep a girl texting me on a regular basis (I always end up getting ghosted, which is fine if it really doesn't click, or just place myself in the fz). I don't want to keep texting first or carry a conversation with questions that most of the time, am the only one asking. I'm also not looking for any specific relationship. 

Like recently, I went to the club and kissed a girl, we had a good time, she confirmed it to me too. I texted her a few times before kissing her and after, but I couldn't get it towards one on one time.

The only thing that may have changed about me are my ambitions and internal energy, but my friends don't seem to see any difference and also maybe my communication skills as I feel I have to ask more questions than I used to.

Do you guys have any advice on something I could be doing wrong or just generally on some things i do that are unappealing ? Thank you

Edit : funny thing, I tend to hang out with more girl friends than I used to so maybe I'm giving off gay vibes ?
