Diminishing Marginal Productivity?
Read [this criticism of "the Neoclassical supply curve"](https://www.patreon.com/posts/separating-fact-50009089) which provides a decent amount of empirical research on whether or not the cost structure of firms reflects the diminishing marginal productivity in real world outside of free market abstracts. They apparently don't by what is provided. I've had trouble locating any opposing research that might run counter to this argument (which kinda confirms his argument), and was wondering if one of the academic posters here can point me toward it?
