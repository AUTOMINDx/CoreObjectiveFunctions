What to do about executives who won't write stuff down?
I work for a smallish MSP, and I can't get this one Executive to write anything down. The company has about 150 people. I'm a manager and often need input from his group.

He has a C-level title, however he leads a technical group responsible for technical direction in the company. However there's no paper trail. I have asked him for documentation/ summaries in the past and he flat out refused. He often makes technical claims then I ask him for references/explanations and he also refuses   (He does have an ego but that's not a huge problem to work around)

As a side note his group is atrocious at technical documentation. The answer is only in someone's head. This leads to a lot of unnecessary meetings and missing information.

At previous companies, everyone at all levels were expected to have strong written communication skills . (Technology Consulting)

Am I off base here? Did I just get lucky at other companies ?  

I'm struggling because this guy isn't easy to work around. I'm often blindsided by "decisions" he's made and my team is left holding the bag when he sells something or makes claims with no explanations. It's caused quite a few headaches for the organization.
