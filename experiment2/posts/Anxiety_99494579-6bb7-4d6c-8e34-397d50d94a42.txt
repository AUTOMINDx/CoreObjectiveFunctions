Ocd and tension headaches?
So there's this tension headache thing that I couldn't shake off for a week now. It feels like there's a lot of pressure in my head and it causes my head to feel heavy. Also, parts of it feels blocked and I feel like there's a tightness in my head. It basically happens whenever I am focusing on my head's sensation. In other words, I keep obsessing over the pain in my head (how I feel right now, what if I get a headache by thinking about it, that kind of thing). Distracting myself does help, however I can't take my focus completely off of it no matter what. I am aware of it 24/7. It's kind of like thinking about headaches actually gives me headaches. Is this normal and did anyone else experience this?
