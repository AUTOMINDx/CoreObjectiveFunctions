What do you think your 3 best traits are?
I know it can be hard to "boast" about ourselves, but I want know what you think.

Honesty, intelligence/learning, kindness, fortitude, etc.

My absolute greatest trait is humility, though it's hard to be when you're as great as I am

Edit: for fun, what trait do you feel you need to work on? Mine's communication. I have trouble expressing my thoughts which I think leads to misunderstanding. I think I also tend to "hold back" my thoughts/feelings which doesn't help
