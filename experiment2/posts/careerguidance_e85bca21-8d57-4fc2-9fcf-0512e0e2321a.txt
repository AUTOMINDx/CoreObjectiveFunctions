Can I apply for PFMLA as a contractor?
Hi all, not sure if anyone in here works for HR that can help me or direct me to the correct subreddit.. I was wondering if I work as a contractor will I be able to apply for PFMLA (Massachusetts) when I go on maternity leave? 

This is what I found from mass.gov

General eligibility:
Generally, PFML coverage is available to all W-2 workers who work in Massachusetts, whether full-time, part-time, or seasonal, as well as some 1099-MISC contractors. If you have questions about your PFML eligibility, ask your employer.

You're covered by the PFML law if:

You're an employee working for a Massachusetts business or a state agency

You’re a contractor who receives a 1099-MISC tax form from a business that issues 1099-MISC tax forms to more than 50% of its workforce

Your employer doesn't have a private paid leave plan that has been approved by the Department of Family and Medial Leave because it provides benefits that are equal to or greater than the state's coverage

You’re a former employee who has been unemployed for 26 week or fewer

Thanks
