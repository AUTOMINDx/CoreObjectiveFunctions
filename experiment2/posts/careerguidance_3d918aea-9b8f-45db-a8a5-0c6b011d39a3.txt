Does it exists?
Anyone know of a decent paying job that allows you to occasionally travel overseas? I’m working as a project engineer for a general contractor and want a switch. I’m considering sales because of the opportunity to earn more money and see a change in pay from harder work but I’m not sure what type would allow me to travel occasionally? I also want to get out from behind a desk and more in front of people. I have really good ideas and can talk to just about anyone. Anyone have an ideas by chance? Thanks in advance!
