My depression is isolating me from others
I’m in the process of being on a wait list to see a doctor/therapist but in the meantime, I’ve been relying on friends to help. I really didn’t intend for it to be a long-term wait and I’ve noticed my behavior is causing resentment from friends and family. I don’t want to be a burden and so I’ve started talking less and less so I don’t bring up my sad feelings or thoughts. I’ve been recently canceling invites to hang out and even backing away from things such as online groups. 

It’s becoming a fight between my depressive thoughts and not wanting to bother people. I’m trying to find books, journaling, or anything really to help me get by so I don’t destroy my relationships. I really do want to go out and be social but the fear of ruining other peoples days has kept me inside except for the mandatory events (school and work). I don’t know if this isolation is hurting me more or if there’s something I can do to hold me by until I can get help. Any advice or input appreciated, sorry again.
