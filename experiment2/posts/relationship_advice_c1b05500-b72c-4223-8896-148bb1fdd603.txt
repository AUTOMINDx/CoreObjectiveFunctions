My (27F) husband (35M) wants me to change my 3 chihuahuas last names to his last name
We got married about 3 years ago and I had 3 chihuahuas going into the relationship and he had 1 chihuahua. 

I chose to take his last name when we married because it’s the customary thing to do and I liked his last name better anyway, so I didn’t really care. 

Anyway, I’ve had my 3 chihuahuas for 13, 12 and 11 years respectively, and I gave them all my last name (obviously). 

My husband is now starting to kick up dust and complain that he wants all the dogs to have the same last name (his) because he feels that as a family, we should all have the same last name. 

I am a bit uncomfortable changing the dogs last name because they already are who they are and I don’t want to confuse them and take away their identities. 

This is causing a lot of drama in our relationship and I’m not sure how to manage this. 

Help?
