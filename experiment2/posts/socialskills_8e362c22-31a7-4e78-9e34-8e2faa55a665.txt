When do i get to stop working?
Or at least, when do i get to a point where I'm doing a routine that involves little to no thought. Everytime I try to improve my social skills i make a little bit of progress for a few days and then i start to relax a little bit and I'm back to talking like a confused toddler.

For example, i tell myself to ask people more questions, i get tired or have a bad day that forces me to work less hard, and now I'm a wierdo again, and now have to find a new strategy to get myself out of mental set back.
