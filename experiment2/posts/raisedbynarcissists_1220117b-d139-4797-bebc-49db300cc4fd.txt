Proud of how I responded to mom’s texts last night.
Just learned last week I’ve been being controlled and abused and that it’s still happening even though I moved 20 min. away, and I’m now working on recognizing this in the moment and changing how I respond. I think I did a pretty good job for it being one of my first tries! https://imgur.com/a/jZHS7GY
