How much of what we know about the history of the War of the Roses is propaganda?
I've been reading Alison Weir's War of the Roses summary book and she mentions (once) that a lot of the primary/secondary sources that are studied to form historiography of that period conflict are heavily biased towards the Yorkists. Then she just leaves us with that and continues to tell the story. I keep wondering what are the things being omitted from those medieval chronicles for economic and political reasons. And I wonder if one of the scholars in this forum might know something interesting tangible to this puzzle.
