People don’t feel real
I dead ass thinking I’m going insane, I think I’m borderline schizophrenic atp. The world doesn’t feel real, people don’t feel real. I can’t look at people’s faces for long without getting a sense of fear. Like, it’s almost like I’m scared of people. Granted, I know that they are real and I know I’m just f*cked in the head and I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but I do. It’s like the episode of spongebob where they all go on dry land, everything feels so off than it used to. I’m so afraid of developing schizophrenia, I’m literally mimicking delusions in my head that I KNOW AREN’T TRUE. “Objects can move and they are out to get me.” and yesterday I thought I was hearing things. I’ve been having bad dpdr for the past few days &amp; the fact that I’m low key scared of people makes me think I’m having persecutory delusions. People just look… weird to me. I can’t look at them without needing to look away because of how fake they look. I keep stressing out because I can’t snap out of it, and it’s making fear myself so badly. My thoughts feel off and I truly think I’m close to being psychotic.
