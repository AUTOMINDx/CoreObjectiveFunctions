What's this feeling called?
My sister and I are very close and have a really strong bond. She practically raised me. We hang out a lot and spend most of our days with each other, even more often now since we moved out together.

Recently though, she's been talking to someone. We don't know yet, but maybe down the line they might be in a relationship. It's been really difficult for me emotionally to get used to this because it makes me think, "Okay, she has someone now, so she won't need me anymore." Her meeting someone new and me getting used to her possibly dating again is new to both of us during this time. I did share how I felt to my sister, and she reassured me that she loves me and that I'll always be number one. But because of my severe anxiety, it makes it hard for me to believe this.

I'm happy when we spend time together. But when she goes on voicecalls or tries something new related to said person I go quiet, keep to myself and emotionally detach?

I don't recall ever feeling this way before when she's dated previously. But it's been a couple years now, so getting used to her sharing her time with someone else is extrenely difficult. When she had a voicecall the first time, I thought to myself they'll have one again. And because I know that, I should be fine with it. They have a voicecall again, and I detached.

Not as severe, but I had this same feeling towards my cousin who got into a relationship recently. I'm not as close to her as I am with my sister, but I did tear up while asking her, "You'll still hang out with me, right?"

I don't know if this is a feeling of abandonment or not. It's definitely feeling unwanted..? If there's anyway to describe it, I want to be able to narrow this feeling down so that I can find healthier ways to cope.
