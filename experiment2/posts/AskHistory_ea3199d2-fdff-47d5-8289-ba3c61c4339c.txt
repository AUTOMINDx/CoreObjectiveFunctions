Any good YouTube-style history channels that don't predominantly focus on military history?
I really enjoy YouTube history channels such as Kings &amp; Generals, HistoryMarche, Invicta, BazBattles, etc. I like the more direct, no-nonsense format of such "new" style documentaries compared to traditional TV documentaries, which in today's age feel like they're hyperbolizing, dumbing things down, condescending towards the viewer, or repeating the same myths or exaggerations  that have since been debunked or scoped down by actual historians.

That being said, all of the above channels focus predominantly on military history, or high-level things like states, rulers, etc. I assume they're targeting a predominantly young male audience, which may be more interested in this aspect. One thing I do miss from traditional docus is a more holistic outlook, including ordinary people's lifestyle, culture, arts, literature, food, and other such topics not limited to statesmanship or conflict.

One example of my favorite channels is Historia Civilis, because it focuses on deep socioeconomic issues of Ancient Rome that were the backdrop for the political and military events that happened, rather than just those events in isolations. But Historia Civilis still doesn't focus much on ordinary society and culture, as well as only focusing on Rome. 

What do you feel are some good "new-style" documentary channels (doesn't have to be YT, and can be a paid streaming service) that combine the holistic scope of traditional TV documentaries with the direct, modern-take presentation style of the Internet age?
