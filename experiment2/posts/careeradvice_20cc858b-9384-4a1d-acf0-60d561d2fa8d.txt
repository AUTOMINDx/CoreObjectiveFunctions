Teacher desperately looking for a new career
Hey all,

I’m really hoping someone can help provide me some guidance. I currently teach high school German in Minnesota. I’ve been in the career for 7 years and this is my 4th at my district. The pay has never been great but its been an ok job. I’ve been wanting to find a new career for a few years and I got cut to part time this year so I’m REALLY struggling financially. Making less than 40k now. Things like homeownership, paying for a wedding, kids, having a savings account with more than 3 digits all seem unattainable. At this point I regret ever becoming a teacher in the first place. 

I’ll have my masters in Instructional Design in less than a year, and in addition to German I speak English (duh), Norwegian, Swedish, a little Danish, and I’m learning Finnish. I know the languages are at best a party trick. I’m not a native speaker of any of them (aside from English) and I will always be passed over for a native speaker (rightfully so) for any language specific position. 

I got my resume professionally done earlier this year and spent all summer applying to hundreds of jobs in training, and even entry level positions at a variety of companies. I only got a phone interview at Starbucks who never even followed up. 

How can I make myself more marketable? Am I even desirable in the private business world? I truly regret becoming a teacher at this point and I feel like it’s a deterrent on my resume. I’d like to use my educational experience, but at this point I’m open to just about anything with livable pay. 

TL;DR: I’m a High School teacher looking for a financially stable job so I don’t keep falling further behind in life. At 8 years out of college, I’d like to stop living paycheck to paycheck. I’m at a loss and the future feels bleak. I feel bad saying it, but I just want to make some money and not be worried all the time. 

Thanks in advance!
