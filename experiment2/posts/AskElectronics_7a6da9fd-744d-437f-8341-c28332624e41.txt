Can grounded gloves short a circuit?
This is a follow-up to \[my post yesterday\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/r5ouwp/what\_material\_should\_i\_use\_to\_make\_a\_case\_to/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/r5ouwp/what_material_should_i_use_to_make_a_case_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) as I attempt to diagnose issues with a tiny board connected to a USB. cable. The boards in question are handled by operators wearing grounded gloves in an ESD protection environment. Looking at one of the boards, there are lots of components soldered in through holes (as opposed to SMD, I'm not sure if that's the right term but the components stick out of the bottom of the board) and it would be easy to make contact with multiple of these parts sticking out on the same component.   

I'm more than willing to admit that I don't know what I'm talking about here, but my intuition tells me that a "grounded glove" is a glove with a wire mesh. That means it can conduct electricity, and touching the board with one of these gloves can cause a short, right? Or does the fact that they're grounded mitigate that?  

I'll also add some context to what this board does, just in case it might be helpful. It converts the 5v from the USB to a variable voltage up to 70v to power the component connected to a ribbon cable. I realize that might be pretty high voltage for something like this. No clue how much of a difference it makes.
