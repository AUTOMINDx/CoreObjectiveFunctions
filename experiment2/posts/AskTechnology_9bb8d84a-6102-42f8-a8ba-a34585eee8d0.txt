Motherboard Choices
I was wondering if anyone knows of a motherboard with at least 3 m.2, 1 gen4 pcie, 2.5g lan or two 1g ports. CPU 5800x, gpu 3080, and ram trident z 3600mhz. With 2 gen 3 m.2 and 1 gen 4 m.2 and a hdd. I need two LAN ports one for internet and one for my server. I would just add in a pci card for another lan port but my x570 only has 2 pcie slot one with the 3080 in it and a another having a pcie m.2 card in it. The other two ways I know is a switch or a LAN to type-c adapter. The switch I'm not sure if it would affect either speeds with both the server and the internet connection connected to the pc through one port or if that would even work. LAN to type-c is fine I know the speeds are decent through them I just don't know enough about it to pull the trigger.
