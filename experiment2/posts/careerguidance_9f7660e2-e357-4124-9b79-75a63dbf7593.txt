Is it realistic to make a living selling custom one-off furniture pieces?
I'm a 24yo male with no college (tried and just couldn't do it). I had 1.5yrs where I lived in Scandinavia right after high-school, but then came home and just started working. Right now I work for a family friend installing fences of all kinds, as well as home/contractor stuff for pretty good pay (18/hr). I live at home with my parents, but over COVID I have built a pretty solid, although cramped and chaotic, shop in their garage. 

The one thing I desperately need to do for a living is to build custom bespoke/art furniture pieces, mostly in modern/designer styles from solid wood. I have reached the point where I have found my life calling and I have no choice but to take this path, haha. I know custom furniture is a hard market, but I don't see another path.



I'm hitting some roadblocks that need brainstorming, and I have a few questions.... 

- grandmother lives with us. I get home at 7pm a lot and often either can't work because of obligations, or have to stop at 9/930pm. 2 hrs a day isn't enough to build thus kind of business, I'd say. 

- Because I work, I lose most of the time I could dedicate to the business. My boss is pretty lenient, so we could probably work something out - but just putting this piece of info out there. 

- No backup plan (besides going back to my parents if it fails) and no formal education. I worked for a contractor for a few months in carpentry but didn't really like it. I do really like design and CAD, but I can't see myself spending 2 - 4 years in college. I'm also horrible at math beyond geometry (can't do trig or calc and really don't want to). Formal education paths that would be useful? 

- That also means unless I'm profitable enough to afford it, no health insurance/dental etc., which are the things my parents are ABSOLUTELY MOST concerned about. 

- I REALLY want to move out asap but I need the shop. I'd love to get it out of their garage.


So I know this is a lot of info, but I'm just looking for some perspectives. Thanks for reading.
