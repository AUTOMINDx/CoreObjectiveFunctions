**Some background:**

Since I was a teenager, I've had periodic breakouts of what I refer to as "hives" for lack of a better term - red, raised welts, a little bit tender and itchy. They would come and go after a month and I never paid them much attention. These have now escalated in my late twenties to my whole finger tips.

I had a dermatologist appointment scheduled earlier this year for Nov 18th, and the dermatologists could not figure out what they were seeing. I would like to note that starting in mid October, my right hand has escalated into extreme swelling with some clubbing, and painful welts on the fingertips. Family doctor also had an x-ray performed, which came back normal.

My doctor referred me to a rheumatologist. The appointment is a phone consultation in two months...idk when I will be physically examined. 

Most suggestions have been to take aspirin to help with the swelling, but it's been a week now and I'm not entirely sure aspirin is having an effect.

**Current symptoms:**

Finger tips on my right hand are bright red, swollen, and occasionally have what looks like a raised welt. The area of swelling keeps escalating down my fingers. Derms indicated there is low grade clubbing based on nail angle. Occasionally it really burns and feels hot to the touch, but usually I'm extremely cold. Some areas have little red dots in a concentrated and painful welt. Hurts to bump into anything even a little bit, and when I'm really swollen it's difficult to make a fist or perform basic tasks. Getting cold sweats a lot.

No pain in my joints. No itching. Feeling more fatigued than normal lately. Some chest pain and difficulty breathing or feeling like I'm receiving enough oxygen when I breathe, but I was previously told this is likely related to anemia. Sweaty palms and feet my whole life, with night sweats.

My left hand is totally normal by comparison. See pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/IU5ifML](https://imgur.com/a/IU5ifML)

I'm right-handed, a student, an artist, and in need of my hands for work... the sudden onset of these symptoms is really scary, no one seems to know what's going on and all I hear is that my results are "normal" even though my physical symptoms are clearly not. Any advice would be appreciated.
