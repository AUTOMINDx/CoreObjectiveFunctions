Is the goal of Therapy to not be in Therapy? What's your opinion.
Hi,

My Therapist said the goal of Therapy is to not be in Therapy and be self sufficient. What's your opinion?

I assume they mean people that don't need Therapy in order to manage medications in the form of Psychiatrist that requires you work with a Therapist.

Interested to especially hear Therapists input.
