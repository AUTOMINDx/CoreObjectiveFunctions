Help me....how to get out of this
I want to sleep at 10pm , but I sleep at 3am all the time and I think it started to affect my skin negatively if I don't imagine it. 

I don't feel sleepy, all I do is lying in bed all day all time, I feel lazy and tired to do my works, study, days passed I am stuck here. How to get out of this.

A week has past and I have not studied a single bit on online classes. I just want to use my phone or think about what I want to do to improve my appearance  and cannot concentrate on the lessons.
