I go mute around my family
I must seem like a madman. I live in the same house with my parents and sister and whenever they apear I don't look their way, I don't look at their faces, when they speak I just mutter something so they stop and go away. In the past I thought this was splitting as I suspected myself of BPD. Sometimes I also got this thought of wishing to be able to witness this family life but not be a part of it and having to interact. As if, if only I wasn't me, with my feelings, I could keep in touch with something like a family (which in the long run reminds me of dissociating). Is it freezing? Am I splitting? Is it selective mutism? Am I crazy?

The thing is I still haven't figured it out whether I was actually neglected and traumatised or just a nutcase. I have this intelectual awarness that it's highly unbelivable to have dissociative symptoms without trauma but on the other hand what if I'm just a special care case? What if I'm just so organically different that my parents' normal behaviour or slightly different behaviour triggered me and they're not to blame? What if I just learned to freeze and dissociate early on and carried on?
