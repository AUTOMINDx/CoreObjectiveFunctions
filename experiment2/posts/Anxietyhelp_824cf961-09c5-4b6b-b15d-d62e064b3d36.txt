Forgetting parts of anxiety.
I’ve started to forget certain a person said and that would be seen as a good thing right? No, not to my brain at least. My brain thinks, “Oh, you’ve got to remember that! So what it caused you anxiety? Remember it! Remember it!” It is so annoying! I think it has something to do with OCD and curiousness. I’m way too curious in my opinion. In fact, curiosity is what started this whole thing for me. One act of curiousness caused my descent into anxiety! I feel like if I was less curious than I wouldn’t in these situations.
