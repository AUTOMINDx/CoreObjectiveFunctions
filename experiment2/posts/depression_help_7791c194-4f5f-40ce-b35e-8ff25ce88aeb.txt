I don’t know how to get better anymore
The last couple of years has been a constant downward decline in my mental health. 

I’m now at the point where literally nothing brings me any joy or feelings in general. I used to love Halloween. I felt nothing for it this year. I enjoyed decorating for Christmas but I have zero desire to decorate at all this year. 

My tipping point came a few weeks ago when an attempted birthday celebration too a very sour turn and I had to be in a “the show must go on” headspace while wanting to just not exist anymore. It was one of my last attempts of trying to establish any sense of a support network. 

I just do everything wrong and I don’t want to be here anymore.
