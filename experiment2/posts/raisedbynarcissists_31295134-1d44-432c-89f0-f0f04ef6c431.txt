Every time my mom breaks NC it reminded me why I have it.
You know what her apology was? “I’m sorry you hate me.” She then tried to call me through messager. I just don’t know man. I’m visiting the rest of the family come Christmas because they have in fact been nothing but supportive throughout. I’m not sure how I’m going to be civil.
