Wondering if I've had costochondritis this whole time...
Sorry in advance for the long-ish post! Have a lot of thoughts and I think my fiance is tired of hearing about it lol. 

Everything started in late January after dinner (steak, green beans, mashed potatoes, and wine) I had a little heart palpitation and chest pain. The chest pain lasted a week and felt it needed to be popped if that makes sense. No other symptoms. My PCP said steak probably got caught and irritated the lining of the esophagus (giving me esophagitis which can cause chest pain). She put me on PPI for two months and told me to stick to the GERD diet and it'll heal by then. I ended up seeing a GI doc just to confirm and had an endoscopy a month later that showed a little inflammation but nothing concerning. 8 months later and I'm still trying to figure out the root cause of my symptoms that come and go (metallic/bitter taste in mouth, slight burning after eating too much, and occasional chest pain). 

Every once in a while I get chest pain but not like that time and how it is right now. It just came back on thanksgiving day after I taste-tested our mashed potatoes. A coincidence since the first time I experienced it was after eating mashed potatoes. 

I've been on 20mg omeprazole ever since Jan thinking I've had GERD this whole time. I still have reflux symptoms occasionally but I've read that some people have both costo and reflux, and they can sort of feed off/trigger each other. I've never had much reflux at all before this started.  Btw it's worth mentioning that both times I had blood work in Jan/Feb, my white blood cell count was elevated which can indicate inflammation.

My fiance's dad is a dr and he said my symptoms sound just like costo and he was surprised that none of my dr's looked into it. I see my GI doc next week and I'm going to propose weaning off my PPI's in the new year. 

Does anybody have a similar experience or similar symptoms?
