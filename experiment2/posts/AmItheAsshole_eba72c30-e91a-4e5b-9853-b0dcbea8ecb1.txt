AITA for refusing to be around my brothers new dog and being unable to be happy for him about it?
AITA for being unable to be happy for my brother about his new dog and refusing to be around it?

I (20 F) have just lost my beloved childhood pet, a brown cocker spaniel who I’ve had since I was 7. This dog was essentially my life and I’ve gone through pre school, primary school, secondary school and my first two years of uni with him. I don’t remember ever not having him.
Unfortunately at the age of 13, he had a stroke overnight and had to be put down a little over 3 weeks ago and as you can imagine…I was devastated. I couldn’t function for over two days, constantly crying, swollen eyes, I was a mess! 
I’m just starting to get a bit more controlled with my emotions about it and I’ve been doing well! 
Well, my brother (31 M) has wanted a dog for a while and was going to get a rescue. However, my dad found a litter of brown cocker spaniels which they decide to go look at.

Initially my brother wanted the boy (there was a male and a female left) and my niece (who is only 8 so o don’t blame her) wanted to call it the same name…to which my mum said yes to! My dad was on my side with this though and said it wasn’t happening!

That same day, my brother buys a brown cocker spaniel puppy, identical to my baby….brings it to my HOUSE, let’s it play with my dead dogs toys…and as you can imagine I walked into this and immediately starting crying and had to leave.

My mum says I’m selfish for getting upset and angry about it and says she doesn’t get why I’m upset about it, but I’m still so devastated over losing my baby and having an identical looking dog around me so soon just broke me…am I the asshole?
