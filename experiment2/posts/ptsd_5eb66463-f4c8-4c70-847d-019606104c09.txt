Is ptsd being stuck
Ocasionally I get flashbacks, (not of the event itself but more of how my life was during the time of the event, the friends I had, the school I went to) and it is a nostalgic feeling. So much change happened in my life so suddenly and I just still haven’t gotten over it and near enough every day it’s like I’m reliving the same feelings I had at the time I can’t explain it but it’s as If I’m not living in this year 2021 I’m living in the time it happened 2019 I’m so tired every single day I wake up every day is the same and I mean I don’t really have much help from anyone but it is this consistent feeling of being stuck in the past I cant get my head around the incident
