Midlife career change advice please?
Have worked in the Philadelphia region for nearly 20 years in the 911 field (roles/responsibilities including calltaker, dispatcher, trainer, instructor, social media manager, policy creation/revision, accreditation manager). I have a BS in Emergency Management and an MPA. Have been submitting applications like crazy recently to federal and private sector positions. Ideally would like something remote as an analyst of some sort for emergency/crisis management, policies, or public affairs. 

Unfortunately haven’t been getting any interviews (ETA I’ve only been applying for the past 2-3 weeks so probably not enough time for responses w/the holiday I’m guessing) and I think it’s because 911 seems like such a niche field to those outside of it. How can I better explain how my unique skills can be applied to numerous fields? Any recommended resources I should access such as resume assistance? TIA!
