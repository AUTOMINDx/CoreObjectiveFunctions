My boyfriend doesnt like how I dress
I dress in baggy clothes. Due to me being insecure about my body. I choose to wear hoodies, leggings, big tees &amp; etc. He mentioned how I dress “weird” and I never dress up when we go out. It hurt my feelings kind of alot. I am very insecure about my body lately and now on top of that I am told this. Even when I wasnt as insecure as I was now I never wore revealing clothes. I dont know I feel like he just doesnt find me attractive. I dont know what to do but any advice helps honestly.
