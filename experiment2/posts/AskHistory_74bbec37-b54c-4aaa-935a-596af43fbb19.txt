Eyewitness to History Project!
Hi! For a Social Studies project at school, I have to find a person that witnessed or survived a major historical event. This can include war and big natural disasters too. I then have to interview this person and ask about 10-15 questions and write an essay about it and include the interview. The event can not be something you witnessed on TV, you have to have experienced the event in person

I live in a run of the mill family that hasn't really experienced anything significant. I was wondering if some of you guys could help me out with this. If you have the time feel free to comment the historical event that you have witnessed personally and tell me a bit about it. I will then choose the best fit one and direct message you questions about the event. Thanks for your time and help!
