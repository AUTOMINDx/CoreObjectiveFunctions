Does it ever bother any of you when people say “but you seem so normal” or have you had people tell you that?
Like thanks. I was trained to be stoic and not mention any mental or physical health problems I had and to always smile and take it. Hell I could be feeling the worst headache ever have a fever and be vomiting and people will be like “well you don’t look sick”. Even worse I tell some friends I have trauma because they seem to think my life is so easy and I never ask for help and they don’t believe me because I’m not “depressed or anxious enough”. I’m plenty anxious and depressed I just come across as calm and a little cold but it still hurts every time. If I can not dismiss your problems and be there as a friend I sure as hell would expect the same from a friend.
