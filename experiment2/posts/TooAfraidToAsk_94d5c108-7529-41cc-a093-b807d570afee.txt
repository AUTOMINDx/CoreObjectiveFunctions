Is it rude to contact multiple tattoo artists with my idea and have them make sketches, and ultimately only pick one?
I have a really specific idea in mind for my tattoo, and maybe I should just pick an artist and work with them on tweaking the drawing until I’m satisfied. I don’t want to waste peoples time, but also I’m nervous that I won’t end up loving a single artist’s work.
