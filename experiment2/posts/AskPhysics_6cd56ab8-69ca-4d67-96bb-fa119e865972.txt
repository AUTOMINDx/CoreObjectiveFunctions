Does rotational mass or weight help a bicycle go faster than stationary mass / weight?
TL / DR - If a cyclist removes 1 lb of weight from their bike frame vs losing 1 lb of weight from their rims, does one make them faster than another assuming the same power output?  

Sorry for the weird phrasing, but I'm a middle aged Dad just trying to justify buying fancy rims!  Another way to put it would the gain be greater saving 1 lb on tires and rims vs bike frame weight.  This question comes up a lot in the biking world and seems like the auto world too.  Lots of "science" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq2fZzAuS6w&amp;t=168s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq2fZzAuS6w&amp;t=168s) being done on YouTube.  BTW if someone is a YouTuber and would make a legit experiment, Hello Smarter Every Day!, you'd get about a 1M views because...cyclists.
