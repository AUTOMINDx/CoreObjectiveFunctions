What are some side hustles more profitable than working a regular job?
I am 28 male, I currently make $9.75 as a security guard. I don't want to keep doing security and want out. I was wondering if there are any side hustles that make more than my minimum wage?

I was told that growing culinary mushrooms could be quite profitable. Saw a video on YouTube where a guy sold $1000 a week usually growing them. Any other suggestions?
