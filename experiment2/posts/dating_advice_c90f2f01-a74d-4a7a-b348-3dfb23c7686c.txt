Is it unhealthy or clingy to be texting someone all day? how can i effectively communicate with someone that i don’t need to be texting them all day everyday without being hurtful or seeming like i’m not interested?
i’m 24 (F) and ever since i was a a young teenager, i thought texting the person you like or that is your boyfriend/girlfriend all day was normal. that’s what i would see all my friends in relationships doing, and i noticed people i’d be involved with would text a lot as well. it’s not that i need to be talking or in constant communication with someone; i genuinely thought that was just what relationships were like for people my age and younger. if someone said to me they needed less communication i wouldn’t be offended at all. but i’m noticing as i reflect on and experience more relationships , that this little thing of texting has helped foster and elevate some codependency issues within me and with past people. i’m seeing someone new casually and i enjoy them, but i’ve done a lot of work on myself and don’t want to repeat past mistakes i have made in relationships if i can help it. we’ve been texting everyday since our first date two weeks ago and while i enjoy talking to them, like i said i want to do relationships and dating differently. i’m still learning how to feel comfortable and open when communicating in relationships, so any thoughts or advice on this matter would really be appreciated !
