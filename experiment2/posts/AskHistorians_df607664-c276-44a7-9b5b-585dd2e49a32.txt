How did the American press get from partisan journalism in the mid-19th century to more politically neutral journalism by the 70s?
In the mid-19th century America newspapers fell along party lines. The same speech by Lincoln might be reported differently in a Republican newspaper than in a Democratic newspaper. But by the 1970s people across the political spectrum watched, listened to and read much the same sources. This implies that the 19th century newspapers at some point became or were replaced by more neutral news sources. So what exactly happened, and at what point?
