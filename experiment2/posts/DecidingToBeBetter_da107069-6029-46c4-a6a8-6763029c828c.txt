I made an scenario that made me wanna work for my goals!
Please know that this might not work for everyone.

Okay so imagen:
one day you meet a fairy/genie whatever. And they say: I can make your wishes come true in one moment. But it can only be 1 wish, and it has to he realistic and has to be about your enviroment, not you, but your enviroment. They even allow you to make a list and everything on that list can come true.

So you make a list, on that list (well it might vary for everyone) stands your dream job, the amount of money you have, the relationships your are in, the house you live in, your dream car. Etc.

You give that list to your fairy/genie and they snap their fingers and bamm. Everything comes true. But too keep it all fair, if someone asks you how you all have achieved these goals. You have no choice then to give credit to this fairy/genie. Like the words “it was a …” comes out of your mouth without wanting to. This is so that the fairy/genie get’s there well deserved credit. And it’s wierd because no one is gonna believe you. And even if they would they would just think you are lazy.

Well this might sound amazing as first because you finnally got your dream life. But life is chaotic so it is not like bad days cannot happen now. And you cannot even show of all the amazing skills you got over the years. Since you never got the skills. You can be fired because you could be terrible at your job. The relationship can be toxic because you weren’t specific enough etc.

Anyway this life can be amazing, it can also suck depens on your mindset, and how specific you where.

But if it where up to me. I wouldn’t take it. There was nothing I did to achieve these goals, besides making a list. And have to give credit to the fairy/genie. I cannot even lie about it. People will just see me as lazy, and spoiled, because I am. 

Okay yeah that’s it!
