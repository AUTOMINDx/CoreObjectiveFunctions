Whats your thoughts on the mens rights movement?
Eddit to correct an error: with mens rights movement I didnt mean MRM but as an umbrella term for groups that want to solve mens problems


I mean the non extreme mens rights so not women hating/mens surpremacy movement

Cause it looks like a loot of people think you can either be a Feminist or a mens rights activist and that these two groups have to fight each other while in reality these two movements could fight together for a lot of things supporting each other instead of hateing and hindering one another
