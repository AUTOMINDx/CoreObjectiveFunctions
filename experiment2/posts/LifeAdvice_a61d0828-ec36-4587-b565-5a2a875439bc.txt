Car suggestions
Hello, I recently hit a beam with the front driver side of my car. It’s drivable but the headlight and front bumper most likely need to be replaced. I also had a clear bra on the car, so I’m not sure how that comes into play. I drive a ‘14 Toyota 4Runner and owe just under $17k on it. I’m looking for suggestions on what would be the best course of action financially. I would like to get a new car but was wondering if I should get the damage fixed because I may get more money back when I trade it in and if I do get the damage fixed, should I go through insurance or try to pay out of pocket? Thank you in advance!
