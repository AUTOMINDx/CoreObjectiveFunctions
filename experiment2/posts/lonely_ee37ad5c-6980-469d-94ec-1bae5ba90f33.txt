Positives of being lonely?
Just stumbled upon on this subreddit &amp; see a lot of sad posts. So, I am trying something different. 

Do any of you have any positives from being lonely? If it made you better in some way? 

For me, it’s mostly just learning to be comfortable on my own. I do a lot of activities by myself or just go out looking for people to do an activity with. It’s also made me better at socializing. 

I know it’s different for people w/ kids or S/O’s, but maybe you can think of something you’ve improved in that you didn’t realize.
