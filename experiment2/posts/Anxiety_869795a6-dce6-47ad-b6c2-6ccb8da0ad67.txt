Anxiety is so damn exhausting
Recently I have been having bad anxiety and insomnia, and of course the insomnia makes my anxiety worse which then makes it harder to fall sleep. A never ending cycle. It's always so weird that when I have a week or so of intense anxiety I am just wishing for a moment of peace, then I will get a few weeks anxiety free and kind of just become complacent and not realize how good it is to feel normal, not depersonalized and having panic attacks all day long.

Whenever I do have any sort of normalcy during those bad weeks, I just feel so mentally drained, to the point where all I can do is just cry because I feel like a husk of a person.

I always feel like I am going insane or dying, or both. I fucking hate this, it's quite literally crippling I would seriously do almost anything to be rid of this.
