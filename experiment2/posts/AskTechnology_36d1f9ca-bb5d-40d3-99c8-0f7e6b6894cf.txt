I'm not getting any wifi signal in a bedroom very far away from the router. I tried a wi-fi repeater but the signal is very inconsistent to repeat. Is there an ethernet solution I can use?
Ideally I could plug in an ethernet cable into a device that is physically cabled to the router, and then be able to plug other ethernet cables into that, on top of being able to use it as a wifi hotspot.  Is some sort of repeater that is connected to the main router via ethernet possible? Unfortunately the router was setup in the house in the only spot it could be. My sports room in my basement is having terrible wifi reception as a result
