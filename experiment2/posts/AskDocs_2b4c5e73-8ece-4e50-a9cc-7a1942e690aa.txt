A few years back I went on a vacation to Arizona, my nose for scabbed inside and when I came back to California my nose hasn't been right ever since. It is dry every day, I am constantly picking it because I can feel everything due to the dryness, sometimes it scabs especially on the winter. Is there a way I can fix this problem for good. I dont do flownaise or any of that stuff anymore and dont intend to. Before my trip to Arizona my nose was fine.
