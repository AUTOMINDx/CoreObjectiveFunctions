Anxiety about not knowing everything
Is there a concept or term to address the anxiousness of realizing that you will never be able to learn everything there is to know, read every book there is to read, or watch every movie there is to watch? I have been experiencing this lately, and I wonder if there are philosophers who have addressed this.
