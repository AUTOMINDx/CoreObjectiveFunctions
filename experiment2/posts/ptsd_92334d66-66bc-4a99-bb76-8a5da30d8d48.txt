Did PTSD change anyones sexuality?
27 YO F here. Thought of myself as bi but could never be intimate with men or was attracted to them sexually but have history of sexual assault and thus thought it was due to that and not because Iâ€™m potentially lesbian. Hopeful to hear if anyone else has stories like this?
