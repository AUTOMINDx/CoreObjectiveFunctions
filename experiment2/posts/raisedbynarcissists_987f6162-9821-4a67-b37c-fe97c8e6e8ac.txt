My mother told me that she doesn’t like me box braiding my hair because it makes me look Black.
First of all I’m Blasian, mother is Asian and father is African American. I grew up in the Philippines. I remember when I was young my dad would ask my mom to box braid my hair and I loved it!
When I learned how to do it myself I would always wear my hair that way. 

One time I was box braiding my hair and I put some beads on it. My mother told me what she doesn’t like me box braiding my hair because it makes me look “black” and she said kids might tease me. I actually stop braiding my hair because of what she said.

I never understood why my mom never wanted me to be comfortable in my own skin. It felt that she was embarrassed of how I looked. 

She would tell me to wear gold jewelry so people won’t mistaken me as part of an indigenous group, she would buy me whitening lotion and cream, never wanted to go swim because I might  get too tanned. 

Can’t marry an African American and expect to have light skinned kids. It ain’t gonna happen.
