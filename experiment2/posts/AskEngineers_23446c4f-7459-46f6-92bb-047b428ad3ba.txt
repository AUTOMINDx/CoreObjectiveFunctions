How to make air circulate in 2-storey house with air passing through/from top of room partition?
Think of my house like a square donut with square hole(2meters x 2meters). The thickness of donut is 2 floors and the donut hole is a room with height passing through the two floors and has no cover on top. Now, move this hole to the back of the house.

The rooms surrounding this hole (on both floors) have windows. The problem is, air feels stagnant at the back.

Only the front of the house have windows. I don't know how to make the air circulate in the house. I need to fix this before another COVID surge comes. Is there any efficient way like a device/machinery for this? Help
