LBM with blood discharge...?
I'm in need of immediate help, I'm writhing in pain as I'm writing this.

TLDR; I'm having LBM but I don't eat (and drink) a lot so there's nothing much to discharge, and now after a few days, it has blood too!

[Info: 25, female, never smoked/drank alcohol (if that matters), I don't take any medications, only medical issue is about my eyes so it's not related, and if this info is of help, I've had an amoebiasis when I was young (grade school or high school I think) but that was once]

Backstory, I've always been constipated ever since I was young. I mostly p0op like once or twice a week. But every once in a while, I'm having severe stomach ache that makes me cry in the loo because there's nothing to discharge. There were times when I'll purposely try to v0mit just to probably release what's inside my stomach, thinking it would help.

Anyway so in my current case, this has only ever happened to me twice. The first time was just this September 2021. I had this severe stomach pain/LBM which lasted for like a whole month? And the pattern is almost the same. LBM first few days, then I lose appetite, less p0op, more blood in a few days. And more more more stomach pain. This one now started like last Thursday or Friday? And it is Monday today. I don't know if I'm having hemorrhage too(?) (I don't know since I'm not a doctor and I also haven't had it checked) because of this. Because I keep pushing non-existent p0op out.

I can't afford to go to the doctor because of a lot of reasons, 2 of them being covid and money. And some friend suggested I post here so I did.

I hope I get an answer, and thank you so much!
