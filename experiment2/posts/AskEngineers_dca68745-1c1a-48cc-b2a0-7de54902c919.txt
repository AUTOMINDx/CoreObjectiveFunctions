Using an offer to get a raise
My situation is a little more complex in that for the last two years I’ve had three managers. During that time I’ve constantly brought up my interest in making it to senior level and asking what can I do to improve myself and what are the expectations. I was always told to look at a confluence page (a 1 pager for expectations for senior level) and that’s it. 

The last round of promotions was done right after getting a new boss who used to be a mentor. I didn’t get the promotion and the reasons were all new and had nothing to do with  confluence page. At this point I felt I wasn’t being upfront about my request and I’ve started to engage more with current boss about expectations and improvements. A lot of the discussion has been around what I need to get to senior. Because this conversation ends up only being 30min during our 1on1 we are always talking about it. Being that I work from home, my wife overhears the conversation and recently said it might becoming across desperate. 

When I missed the promotion in July I started applying to jobs, however being that I’m looking for something specific it’s been a long process. 

I just got an offer that isn’t “senior level” mainly because they are a startup and don’t have multiple levels. I was offered a base salary that is 15% higher. I ended up not being interested in it enough to take the job but I want to use it to get a raise at my current job as I like the work and I’ll be happy with the higher salary even without a promotion.

How bad is it to use an offer to get a raise, being that promotion talk has been discussed frequently.
