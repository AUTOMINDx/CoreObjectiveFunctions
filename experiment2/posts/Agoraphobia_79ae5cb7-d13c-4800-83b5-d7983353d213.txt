first long flight advice
hey everyone, hope your Wednesdays are going okay. 

so i’m in a long distance relationship, where im based in europe and they’re in america. this christmas she’s coming to visit me for the first time (so excited!!) and thankfully she’ll be accompanied on her flight out. 

so we’re already planning our next trips and im desperate to fly out to her. i’m planning on doing my first trip in a few months (covid pending lol) and the biggest challenge is my anxiety and agoraphobia, in this case with the flights. i’ve travelled quite a bit when i could and always with friends or family, and all pretty much to europe with flights of 1-2 hours (travelled once to america when i was a kid). while i’ve spent those flights feeling very anxious, they were manageable. 

my flight to my partner will be 11 hours direct at a minimum and im currently going through phases of ‘if i download some movies and play some games i’ll be fine’ to ‘11 hours of straight anxiety trapped in a compact space with lots of people, impossible’. as much as i want to believe the former, i can’t shake the latter. 

i have briefly considered breaking up the flight and stopping over but i think that would be an even more anxiety inducing process. 

any advice on travelling welcome, thanks in advance :)
