How do you cope with years of being friend-less? Does it get better?
After years of bullying and toxicity, I grew a spine and cut  people out of my life. I felt so relieved, but as a result -  I find it hard to trust people or open up to people. I feel socially burntout, I am not very active on social media and I feel like that's where everyone socializes and makes new friends. I get judged by my peers for not being active on social media and having less followers than them! I really don't wanna go out much anymore and the pandemic has worsened my requirement for going out since I WFH. 

I feel very lonely, but I also felt very lonely around my former friends; so it isn't any different tbh. I did try to socialize, but everyone already has their groups and doesn't really wanna include me much and even if they do, we eventually drift apart. I initiate conversations and plan hangouts, but I'm scared I'm bugging them or disturbing them, so I don't try too hard. 

 Is there anyone who faced something similar? Does this come to an end? Is there any advice as to how to deal with bouts of time in our lives when we're alone and friendless?
