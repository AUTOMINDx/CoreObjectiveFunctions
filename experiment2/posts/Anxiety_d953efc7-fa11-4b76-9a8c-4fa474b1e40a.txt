fear of being alone?
My bf is visiting family for the week. We live together and do a lot of things together unless we’re with our friends. But if I need to go basically anywhere else we go together. We’re very close. 

But now I’m in our place alone and my anxiety is through the roof. I feel like I’m crawling out of my skin. I’m jittery. I’m having diarrhea (happens when i’m anxious. Nausea butterflies everything. I’m not worried something bad will happen. I’m not having negative thoughts at all. All I can think is “oh my god I’m alone.” And it’s making me feel so anxiously ill. I wasn’t having an anxiety flare up before this. 

Is this separation anxiety? How do I cope with being alone? I can’t remember the last time I lived alone or even went to the grocery store alone. Going outside is out of the question right now.
