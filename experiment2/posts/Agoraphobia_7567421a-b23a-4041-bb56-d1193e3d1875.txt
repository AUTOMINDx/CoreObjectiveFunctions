Do you have agoraphobia in your dreams?
I’m very curious about this. For me sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t, it’s just random. For example I had a very weird dream last night about walking to a clothes store with my friend (which turned out was run by a shady organisation that wanted to trap us there lol) but I remember feeling a bit unsteady on my feet and feeling the urge to tell my friend that I didn’t want to explore the store and wanted to get home asap. 

Other times I’ll dream I’m walking around a new city or something and I’ll feel fine, I won’t even remember that I have agoraphobia irl.

What’s it like for you?
