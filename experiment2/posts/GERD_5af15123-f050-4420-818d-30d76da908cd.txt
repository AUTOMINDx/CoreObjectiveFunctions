How do you all manage?
I never used to have gerd before I had a tethered cord surgery that left me with severe constipation. Gerd came on I responded well to ppi’s and then eventually found if I could do a bowel prep I actually didn’t need any acid drugs. Now I’ve had to have another cord surgery so bowel prep basically isn’t possible anymore and I have to take insane amounts of Prilosec and that barely cuts it. I maintain at 40mg a day but sometimes need 60-80 to get back in control. The reflux is so bad it gives me these palpitations that just about knock me off my feet. Cardiology has ruled out anything heart related besides a palpitations. My gastro said my endoscopy biopsies came back as 10-15 eosinophils all throughout esophagus but she just thinks it’s severe gerd rather than EOE. Also the PPI drugs make me just so lethargic and depressed along with even more constipated! Is there like a solution to this? The palpitations and esophageal spasms are just so intense they send me into a panic attack and not to be a big baby but this is starting to be somewhat more debilitating than the tethered cord.
