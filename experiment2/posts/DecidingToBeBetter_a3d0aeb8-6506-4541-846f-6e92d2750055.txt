Help, i don't know what to do,this is very strange
My girlfriend told me she's going to another city for a party of her friend, her friend got engaged and is having a party about it.  last night my girlfriend sent me a picture on instagram from some bar and wrote the text 'I miss you' there was a cocktail in the picture..I asked her how is at the party, she said it was ok. She told me that she wish i am there with her, how much she miss me and etc..Thaan 

I'm not a stalker, but I saw that her friend taged her on picture, I went into her friend's profile because I was curious, and on the story highlists I saw the SAME picture, the same EXACTLY THE SAME   picture that  my girlfriend sent me this night, BUT  the picture  on a story higlist from her friend was 56 weeks ago.

I do not know what to do.  it all confuses me.  why did she send me an old picture from her friend's highlist as if it were hers from this night..

There really was party..but why she didn't send me photo from party, but sent old one from her friend..

At 1am I texted her  'Good night'
She replayed at 2:30 am 'i am home now, goodnight ‚ù§' 

I don't know what to do..it's really strange..
