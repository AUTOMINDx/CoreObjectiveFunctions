Engineering Leadership Development Programs (ELDP)
What are some thoughts on Engineering Leadership Development Programs? I know they will differ slightly company to company, but just in general rotational programs that touch a variety of functions in the business. 

Feel free to leave any comments you have, but my specific questions are:

What roles do individuals usually go into after they “graduate”from an ELDP, is it usually more of a management role, an engineering role, or something like business development? 

For those that assume a management role, specifically a technical management role, is there any benefit of going the ELDP role, rather than working as an engineer for several years gaining a solid technical background and then moving into management?

Is the career “trajectory” usually different for someone who did a ELDP compared to someone who didn’t?
