How Can I Find A Fulfilling Career?
Hello, I need some advice on a new career path to target. I graduated in 2018 with a bachelors STEM degree, my concentration was Biotechnology. I also have minors in History and Spanish. Since graduating I’ve worked in commercial Research and Development. I’ve been fortunate to work at high profile companies. I worked in paint formulation/corrosion testing for 2 years, I was laid off at the start of the pandemic. From that position i moved to pharmaceutical manufacturing. I left that job because I don’t care for manufacturing and the position I’m at currently was offering me more money. Currently I’m working in skin health translational science. It’s pretty cool, I take new sun screen formulations and perform testing on efficacy and  develop new testing methodologies. My issue is that I don’t feel fulfilled, nor that bench science is my passion. My job pays very well, but I don’t want to be trapped working somewhere just because of the pay. 

I’m looking to stay in the science field but I want a position that has more tangible effects on day to day human life. Some of my hobbies outside of work are traveling, watching culture/nature documentaries, cooking, gardening, watching/playing sports.

Any advice, experience, or comments would be helpful. Thanks!
