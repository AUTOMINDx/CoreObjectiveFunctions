Do you ever feel like you are just a forgettable person?
So I(21M) don't think anyone really dislikes me bit I'm just kind of there. My social life is basically non-existent and the people I do meet tend to move on very quickly. I always have to be the one to that reaches out and if I don't just nothing will happen, so 99% of my friendships/relationships feel like they die a slow death. I recognize that this partially comes with aging, but it makes me feel like if I just up and disappear no one would notice (don't worry nothing suicidal or something like that.
