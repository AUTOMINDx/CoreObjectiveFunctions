How to Say Sorry at Work?
I've been trying to become more reliable, and I've been reaching out to people to let them know as much. Problem: I forgot a meeting this weekend that a client and I had scheduled. It completely slipped my mind until I picked up my phone six hours later to the notifications.  


Where I go off the rails when communicating is knowing that it was a ridiculous thing to miss, and not knowing how to apologize without sounding like I don't know I'm a flake and a jerk for being unreliable. So instead of emailing or texting right away, I think 'They're just going to roll their eyes and never want to talk to me again.' And end up not messaging because everything I write sounds pathetic and, frankly, annoying.

How do I come back from dropping the ball (again) with friends and clients I think of as friends?
