PWM circuit at 5V
Hi! I was looking for a simple PWM circuit that works at **5V**; I know the well known circuit with 555 timer, and it seems to work at low voltage as well, but I haven't tested it yet, I have to gather all the components first. Do you think that this circuit will work in good conditions at **5V** using  **IRF640N** instead of IRFZ44N ?
