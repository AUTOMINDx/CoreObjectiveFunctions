How many of you feel like they didn‘t accomplish the goals they set for themselves when they were younger?
Hey, I‘m a 22 year old guy from Sweden (please excuse my english mistakes) and lately I‘ve been thinking a lot about the future.

I have noticed that pretty much every time I do that I find myself being fearful of the future. I guess my main concern is wether I will find happiness or not.

Another concern is if I will be able to afford the same lifestyle that my parents gave me (upper middle class but not rich). I think I couldn’t handle downgrading my lifestyle. I don’t want to sound like an asshole here but I just can’t handle the thought of living on a lower standard in my 40s than in my entire childhood.

Most of the times I end up pretty sad and fearful and I just can’t not think of how it will be when I am in my 40s or 50s. Also I am pretty convinced that the majority of adults are rather unhappy/unfulfilled with what they have achieved and how they feel everyday.

I guess I just want to hear some of your stories and how it feels to be a „real adult“ and how life played out for you guys. Maybe some of you had the same thoughts when they where young?

Thanks so much in advance,
Paul
