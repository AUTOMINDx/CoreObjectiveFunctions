I can’t get the flashbacks to stop
Sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, I’m still kinda new to living with ptsd (going on 6 months now). It seems like the flashbacks and reliving this past summer has been increasing in frequency over time, and now it feels like they’re happening just about every night. Things that never used to register in my brain are startling me way more now than before, I’m getting random anxiety attacks now too. I’ve tried finding a therapist, but they’re all booked until the new year (tried every where that insurance covers in my area, and they all had a 6 month + wait list). I just don’t know what to do in the meantime
