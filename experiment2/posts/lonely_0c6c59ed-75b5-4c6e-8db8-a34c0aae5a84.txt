I got stood up on a date today- when will my fortunes change?
I started communicating with a gal from Bumble, and moved on to WhatsApp. I asked her out for drinks this afternoon and offered to pick her up, said no, that she'll arrive on her own. I thought well, that's Ok. So I set the venue and time for 5pm. At 430 texts me saying she's a bit delayed and if we could meet up at 8 instead. I said that's fine. At 745 I texted, told  her I was on my way she said "ok". I arrive at the place, table for 2, she's not there, so I wait. 15 minutes go by, nothing yet. Half an hour waiting and nothings,  so I decide to ask is she's coming.  She then sends me voice notes about how she's not in the city yet, had gone to a friend's house by the ocean for the day, that it was rainy and chilly and  if we could reprogram. She didn't tell me beforehand she was out of town. I thought that showed a complete lack of consideration and manners on her part,  and I told her no, we'll leave it like this.  Then I deleted her number.  Why does this kind of stuff happen to me? Why can't I meet a nice and kind young lady and instead end up attracting weird flaky people? I know having Aspergers makes it more difficult but still, I've made efforts to put myself out there, to no avail. Am I predestined to be alone all of my life? The thought is depressing, but as each year passes, the window of opportunity to find the kind of lady I'm looking for closes bit by bit.
