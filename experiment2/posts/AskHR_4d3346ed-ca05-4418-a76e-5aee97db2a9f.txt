[RU] How do employees' development work in USA-based companies?
Hi everyone! I'm an IT recruiter at HR tech startup.

I want to move towards hr processes, employees' development and learning, especially interested in USA companies. I would like to know how HR managers are currently developing employees in the USA? Who is responsible for personal employees development: HR departement or direct supervisor? What do you use for it? 

Thank you!
