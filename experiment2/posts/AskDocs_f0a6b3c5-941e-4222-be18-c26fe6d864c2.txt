Can a doctor tell you like their touch? (Not trying to be inappropriate, please read the info)
I went to a facial plastic surgeon recently, even though I’m already physically sensitive I didn’t expect that to happen, it just felt really good when he touched my face, specially my nose. I cringe thinking back at it and I think I even closed my eyes. 

I only became aware of how I acted after the fact, now I just feel embarrassed and need some honesty about this. I also wonder if I made him a little uncomfortable specially because I’m a young woman and he seemed a bit nervous, although it could just be his personality or my imagination. 

Is it normal or common for patients to feel that way when touched like this? I feel like a freak. 

I don’t want to seem like I don’t respect him or his practice. He seems like a very kind individual and I will be seeing him again soon for another consultation, I also don’t know how I should react when that happens again.
