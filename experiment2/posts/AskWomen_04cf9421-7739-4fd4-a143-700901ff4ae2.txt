When do you use the good china?
I remember as a kid, perusing the Sears catalogue and they'd have these whole bone china sets that matched. Plates, salad plates, bowls, gravy dishes, et all.

Does anyone still use/have ' fancy plates ' for big get togethers? Did you inherit your grandmother's china or do you hunt it online and in thrift stores?

I do realize we're currently not having big get togethers due to COVID
