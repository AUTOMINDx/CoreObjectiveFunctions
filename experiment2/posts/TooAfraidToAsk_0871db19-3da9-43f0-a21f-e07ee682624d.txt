Why has it become the norm to just not bother checking to see if your title and post make the slightest bit of sense?
I can usually tell if a person isnt speaking their first language....this isnt that. Posts lately are so unreadable its getting extremely frustrating having to decipher a posts title or even go into the comments to see that somebody else thought the same thing but got downvoted for mentioning it. Yet these posts are making their way to front page even though half of it literally makes no sense whatsoever.
