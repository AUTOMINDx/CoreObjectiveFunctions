I want to stop being condecending
Many frinds and partners told me that I have condecending actitudes. I think i'm being just nice but aparently i'm not.
 
So I started taking notes in my responses and actitudes and sadly yes, I am acting condecending
 
 
Would you please tell me your story and how you manage to stop it if it happened to you?
 
 
Do you have any tips? I want to improve!
