How do you maintain that childlike wonder and curiosity about life?
I always feel most “in touch” with myself when I can wonder and daydream about the world… when I can ask questions, hope for a better future, etc…

How do you get in touch with that? After spending so much time in the world, how do you stay in touch with that “magical” sense?
