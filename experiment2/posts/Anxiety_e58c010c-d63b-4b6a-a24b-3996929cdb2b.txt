Currently roadtriping and worried about my health and blood clots and all kinds of shit
Currently on a road trip to move back home and I did some Google searches and now im extremely anxious and afraid that im gonna get deep vein thrombosis and die or something. So now my anxiety has me worried about that. So far I've been sure that we make stops every 1.5-2hrs to stretch and move around for a bit I also did 30 mins of cardio at the hotel gym and im even elevating my legs right now. Should I be this worried as a 24 yr old male over dvt probably not. Am I gonna be worried about it anyways? Yes.
