My mom showed up to my apartment unannounced, with food
....after I sent her a message explaining why I no longer wish to visit the household that I grew up in and was abused in/witnessed my mom being abused in. She turned against me and sided with her abuser (my dad) when I called the police. She allowed my brother to be homeless when he was 16 after a fight with my dad...she was also a part of the problem even though she was a victim. And that messes with my head and my ability to interpret things properly. There were many other major traumatic events that took place that I haven't processed yet and need to work through soon.

She called me this morning and she gave me an apology that included her saying that she "can't go back in the past" and she can "only try to make things right now."

I feel very conflicted because she has put me in a lot of bad situations, and her apology did not acknowledge anything specific from the past. She simply said she's, "sorry, we can't go back" and she "read my message."

Then when she showed up at my apartment, she wanted to come inside. It was super awkward and she came in sulking. I don't know if I should view my mom as a victim of the situation with my dad or if I'm being manipulated. Things often center her and I feel bad for her but I also feel super confused and taken advantage of sometimes.

Now all of a sudden I'm having feelings of guilt. But there's a part of me that feels like:

a- she should have called beforehand to ask if it was okay to come over

&amp;#x200B;

b- I should've set a boundary and not let her into my apartment/accepted the food

&amp;#x200B;

c- I don't know if I just got manipulated into maintaining contact and allowing her to break down a boundary I've been trying to set physically and emotionally

Does anyone have experience with this or advice? I'm not sure how to process this
