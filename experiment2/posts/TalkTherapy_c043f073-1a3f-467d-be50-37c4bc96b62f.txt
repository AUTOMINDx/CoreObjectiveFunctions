Bummed because my therapy session was cancelled last minute
I was really looking forward to my session tomorrow. And then I got a message that my therapist won’t be available tomorrow. I’m telling myself she’s probably sick as to not think she’s abandonning me. Gonna call tommorow to schedule a new appointment but it’ll probably be a 1-2 weeks wait. 

How do you deal with last minute cancellations?
