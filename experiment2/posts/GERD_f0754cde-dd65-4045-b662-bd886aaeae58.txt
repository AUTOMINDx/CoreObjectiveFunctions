Armpit discomfort..and sometimes spread to around your breasts or on your breast
I had my first acid reflux problem in October 2021. I went to ER because I thought it was a heart attack.  The doctor said my chest was fine and my heart was fine. We did x-ray and EGG test. 

After eating bad unhealthy food, I feel discomfort in my armpit or around my breasts or shooting pain on my breast(this is rare). I don't think pain is the right word for it. It's more like  a noticeable discomfort.   Does anyone have this problem? I just don't understand why it's on my breast or my armpit. 

I'm scared it might be breast cancer sometimes...but this happens after I eat unhealthy food, so I don't think it is related to cancer.  It seems like it's more about digestion thing.
