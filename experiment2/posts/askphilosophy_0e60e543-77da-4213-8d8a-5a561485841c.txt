Does Kastrup's idealism imply that phenomenal/mental states and 'physical' brain states are a one to one relationship?
Hi all

Hope you are well

I've been quite enjoying digging into philosophy of mind, and have come to find myself quite drawn to idealism as espoused by Bernando Kastrup. However, I was wondering if there are parallels between this sort of idealism and physicalism - namely that for every conceivable phenomenal experience that there is a corresponding brain/'physical' state.

The reason why I ask this is that I have been quite interested by an argument against physicalism of the mind put forward by Dr Josh Rasmussen, which to paraphrase, goes something like: 

1. Under physicalism of the mind, each mental state has a corresponding physical state
2. There are more conceivable mental states than there are possible physical states
3. Therefore, physicalism of the mind is false

Could the same argument be levied against Kastrup's idealism?  Under his view, each mental state 'presents' in some fashion across the dissociated boundary.  If it presents uniquely, then surely the above argument - if granted to be valid and sound - could also be raised? Something like:

1. Under Kastrups idealism , each mental state has a corresponding transpersonal representation 
2. There are more conceivable mental states than there are possible transpersonal representation states
3. Therefore, Kastrups idealism is false

Thank you so much
