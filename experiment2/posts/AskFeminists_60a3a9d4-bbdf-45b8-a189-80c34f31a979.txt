How to fight internalized Whore/Madonna Complex?
Hey all, 24 year old cis woman here.

I realized last night that even though I am a very vocal feminist and interested in women's issues, I am struggling with a form of internalized misogyny. I used to follow an ED recovery YouTuber named JenBretty, who now just does straight up porn. I saw her (locked, no content) OnlyFans and reading the captions made me sick and kind of mad. I used to really look up to this girl and think she was wonderful, and I'm hurt and angry to see she's doing porn now. 

I did a lot of soul searching and talked to my partner, and I think my reaction boils down to the whore/Madonna complex. I have a very hard time reconciling that women can be both well-rounded, intelligent and fun, AND exploit and display their own hypersexuality. It has to be one or the other. 

I do not support sex work in general because I believe it to be anti-feminist, but I do *not* want to blame individual sex workers. The consumers are the issue. Has anyone else identified a similar issue within themselves, or have any advice on how to reconcile this issue? Thank you.
