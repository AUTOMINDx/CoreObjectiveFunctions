AITA for not missing my dead father and hurting my sisters for it?
So I know the title is awful but just hear me out.  My sisters H (29f), P (19f) and I (21f) lost our dad in September. H called crying while I was at work to tell me that our dad had died. I didn’t believe it, seeing as he managed to outlive not only my mother and his illnesses for as long as he had, I just thought someone was lying to get a reaction out of her. I was later proven wrong. For me, I never liked my dad. Honestly, I hated the man. He wasn’t a good father and made it apparent every day. H and P also didn’t like him but loved him nonetheless. I have voiced to them both, whenever they have asked or if it was brought up somehow, that I wouldn’t miss him when he was gone and a surprise even to me, I was right. As time has past, they have voiced that me not missing my dad is an issue because “it doesn’t matter what he’s done, he was still our dad.” H has even called me a heartless bitch for not caring. I think, considering all the shit he’s done to me, them, our mother and even other people, he doesn’t deserve to be missed or loved to begin with.  

I honestly feel extremely guilty for not missing him. I know I should, considering he was my dad and H and P are hurting since he was the only parent we had left but I can’t forget and forgive all the hell he has put us through. I most likely am the asshole here. 

P.S. I have never told my sisters they couldn’t mourn or feel how they felt about our dad but I don’t think I should be penalized for my feelings either. I know they miss him and I’ve been there for them to help as much as I can with their grief but I shouldn’t be made out as the bad guy for not missing him. I also don’t blame them for how they feel about how I feel so please no hate to them.
