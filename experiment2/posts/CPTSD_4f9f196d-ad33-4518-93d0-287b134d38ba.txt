Crying because of other boundaries.
I [23 F] was hanging out with a guy I’ve been causally dating. We are pretty goofy and playful with each other. Today he expressed a boundary with me after I did something he didn’t like (I didn’t know he wouldn’t and I quickly sincerely apologized. I 100% won’t do it again. A couple minutes went past and I said I needed to go to the bathroom and all I did was cry in the bathroom. I wrote down in my notes while crying “He had a right to express his boundaries. You must take responsibility for your actions. You apologized. And respected his following requests”. He doesn’t know I was crying in the bathroom and when I came back and acted playful and we went on with hanging out.  

But why do I feel so bad why am I still feel terrible about it? Why hours later am I crying about it again?



Edit: Since some want context about what happen. I didn’t put context to my post because I felt embarrassed about boundary the I crossed, but I’ll just say it. 


I made of a meme of him while he was playing a computer game. I took a picture of him playing the game from behind and I quoted it “Shhh, I’m working” cause he was playing the game while he was working at home. So I thought it would be funny. I sent it to his phone and he look at it. He said “Don’t take a picture or video of me every. I’m serious”. I had no intention of posting the pic at all I just wanted to show it to him. I know that’s not an excuse and I should have asked first. And he 100% had I right to tell me he didn’t want to have a picture taken.
