How do I know that the color I see as green, isnâ€™t orange through your eyes but itâ€™s just known as green?
I know McGraw hill says that we have cones and rods in our eyes and color is an illusion caused by light bouncing from a light source off of an object and into our eyes. 

Do we really know if thatâ€™s true though?

McGraw hill also says that DNA molecules are 40,000 times smaller than a strand of hair but theyâ€™re shaped like helixes and give the rest of our respectively gargantuan bodies all the commands and orders ðŸ˜­ 

I digressed too much but yeah sometimes science just seems like the most convincing explanation but thereâ€™s just a chance that it could be absolute bullshit. I did look under a powerful microscope when I was experimenting with quail embryo and my eyes did see what the textbook promised about cleavage and blastulation but I feel like color is more subjective since we respond to things differently
