[CA] vacation payout / comp time payout question
Vacation and Comp'd time payout advice/question

Hi all,

I'm resigning from my job to start a new one. I have quite a lot of vacation and comp'd OT accrued (about 540 hours total), since I expected to be at this job for my first child and was saving all my time for  FML time. Life happens, and we need to move.

My question is...how does this 540 hr payout work. It will be lumped into my normal paycheck - so  my worry was that payroll withholds taxes based on my earring that much in that period. This would blow, as I'd have to wait until 2023 to get back that extra taxes withheld for the abnormally large paycheck.

I've read it is seen as supplemental wages and taxed at a flat 25%? So is my normal paycheck taxed at the regular rates and these supplemental wage payouts are taxed at 25% federal rate, plus medicare/SS withdrawals. 

Not even sure how the state of CA determines the state tax withheld...but any tips are appreciated.

Thought about maxing out IRA withholding but then I miss out on employer match in my new job (current job doesn't match).

Thanks in advance.

Edit: took me more tries than I could count to figure out how to do the state code. SMH.
