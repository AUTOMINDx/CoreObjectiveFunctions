life problem
Hello to everyone, sorry if I post in wrong topic but I have a really big life problem that I can't solve and this is my story. 

My parents has divorced after 6 months after my birth, I am living with my mother for the whole life. I didn't saw my father because of my strict mom which hates my father. 

My childhood was really bad, I didn't have good friend then, either now. Every friend I ever had, was been fake, had an interest or take adventage of me... 

I'm 16 and going to the high school where I already figured out that the two guys are very tense towards me and donâ€™t want to talk to me. They get into it and challenge me whenever they can.

I often think about everything and I get very upset about even small things. I picked it up from my mother. I don't have self respect at all, and I'm worried about anxiety.

Lately I finally meet my father, I found him, had a good times and I think he is really good man.
