AITA for taking my sisters on a shopping spree and not being upfront with my husband?
Whenever we have a disagreement or fight my husband has a habit of giving me gifts or taking me on shopping sprees to make himself feel better. I hate it and it usually makes me feel worse but I tend to not say anything because I don’t like fighting. 

A few days ago, we had a bad fight. Predictably, a few hours later my husband was trying to buy forgiveness but he wasn’t free to go with me so he suggested I go on a shopping trip with my friends or sisters. I did end up going with my sisters but only because I wanted space and to get out of the house.

My sisters are much more into fashion and shopping than me. My younger sister really wanted this bag but it was expensive so I offered to buy it for. Surprisingly, buying it for her actually cheered me up. I ended up buying both of my sisters lots of things and by the time I went home I was feeling very happy.

The day after my parents called me to tell me I shouldn’t have spent so much money on my sisters and that they couldn’t accept. After I had assured them it was fine, my parents started praising my husband for being so generous. I told them he had no idea and my dad got angry at me and told me I shouldn’t have spent so much money without telling him first. They ended up telling him themselves and tried to get my sisters to return their items.

My husband told my parents it was okay but then he was upset with me for lying to him, even though I didn’t technically lie. I told him I had bought lots of nice things, I just never told him these things weren’t for me.

AITA?
