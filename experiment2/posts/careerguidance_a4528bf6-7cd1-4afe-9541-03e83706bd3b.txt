Minimum wage+commission or higher hourly job?
Hey everyone. So here’s my situation I just got my old job back at a retail cellphone store. The base pay is 12.75 which is the minimum wage for my state in the US.  It also pays commission. But same day my background check came through another opportunity landed in my lap. 18 dollars an hour fixing computers, small office, small team, minimal customer interaction. Before I left my retail cellphone store I got promoted but quit for some personal reasons. Being in retail sales is stressful for me but I’m good at it. I love fixing computer problems and it wouldn’t be stressful at all. If I factor in hitting my sales goals every month I made about 23 dollars an hour. I know that when I start I will already be putting in 80 hours a week as the store is a mess right now. What job should I do? 18 dollars an hour is consistent, but commission gives more possibilities to earn more
