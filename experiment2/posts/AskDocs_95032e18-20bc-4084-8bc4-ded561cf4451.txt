Does melatonin make it hard to breathe?
I'm 20 F, 5'1 and 128 lbs. Ive had to take melatonin as a sleep aid because well. I haven't been able to sleep. I'm talking like 2 days straight no sleep kinda deal. Theres no reason for me to not sleep but here I am. I had this problem when I was in middle school too and was put on medication for it, however my psychiatrist doesn't think that pills are the right option for me. I have a history of abuse in that area so they aren't keen on having me on said pills. Understandably. But back to melatonin. I noticed after the 2nd or 3rd day taking it that I couldn't breathe. I had to focus on breathing alot and they were pretty shallow breaths. And when I would fall asleep im pretty sure I would stop breathing all together because I would wake up in a literal jolt and be trying to catch my breath. I did some research and it did say that it causes reactions with asthma sometimes but im not asthmatic. I would know since I've had a pretty active lifestyle. Is this a common thing? If so is there a different sleep aid I could look into? Thank you!
