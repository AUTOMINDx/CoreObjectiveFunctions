Whenever im talking in group chats or discord servers, it feels like im trying way too hard to fit in
I'd say something like "hi how is everyone" and everyone just ignores or give a very short reply and then they continue talking to the rest of the active members in the group/server. No one in there supports me or cares about me, and no one in there ask questions about me. Its like the people in there only respect and care certain people. I'm always acting like some uncool tryhard kid and it just makes me feel miserable sending a message in there.
