Flashbacks - how does everyone elseâ€™s feel
Please I need help.

I developed a fear of going crazy due to my ocd, anyway I went through 2 years of depersonalisation and I was convinced I was going absolutely nutz, every single day from the moment I woke till I went to sleep I was in fight or flight and hyper vigilant beyond belief, it was the most awful and terrifying two years of my life and I wouldnâ€™t wish it on anyone, because I have ocd and it triggered my fear my stress response never went down because of the constant stressing and obsessing. 

Anyway! I ended up finally calming downâ€¦ yes After two years â€¦. And it went away, and it was gone for a year and I was absolutely on top of the world, and then 4 months ago I got a little
Bit of it back and my anxiety was so bad for 5 days straight I didnâ€™t eat I was spewing, I didnâ€™t leave bed and I was very suicidal, then it happened. 

Flashbacks. Iâ€™m now going through every single day with these flashes in front of my face and these horrible horrible physical feelings that I felt back in them two years, the flashes are of my fears coming true, I see faces in my vision, I feel like my body is loosing control, I feel like Iâ€™m disappearing into my mind and coming back out again and the dread is awful. Can anyone help me with whatâ€™s going on? Is this psychosis for real this time or is it trauma ptsd? My doctor says ptsd but how come Iâ€™m having such extreme visual flashbacks all day long???? Allllll day long ðŸ˜ž
