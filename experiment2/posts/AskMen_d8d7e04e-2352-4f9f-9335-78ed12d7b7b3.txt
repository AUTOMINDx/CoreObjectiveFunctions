Men who excessively sweat: how have you dealth with it? (Or other trouble regulating body temperature)
No medical advice! I will be going to see my doctor in a few weeks.

Men who sweat excessively/have hyperhydrosis/ have trouble regulating their body temperature- has any fix worked for you?

I take testosterone injections, I am on antidepressants, blood pressure medicine, finasteride for hair loss, anti-anxiety meds. All under the strict supervision of my doctor. I am also very hairy (head to toe). Lately (the last 6 months) I have been suffering from very bad night sweats and also intense sweating after a minimal amount of physical exertion. I used to be heavier, now I have lost 50lbs and my sweating is worse than usual. I constantly feel like I am overheating, and my forehead perspires the most. Aside from things like Botox to address the excessive sweating from my forehead, what has worked for you to regulate your body temperature? Should I focus on shaving? Has adjusting hormone levels/medication worked for anyone? I sweat profusely any time I walk up a short hill to my classes, and inside the building where it is about 73F I canâ€™t stop sweating for an hour. For sleepingg, I have been trying everything from 62F to 72F. It is becoming an actual problem rather than a nuisance. Please give me some advice.
