Do you think teens nowadays are very worried about their future?
I’d say yes, cost of living in every countries are skyrocketing upward, but the minimum wages aren’t. I’ve seen some 14 years old kids on the internet say that they’d move out of Vancouver for example as soon as they can because the city is too expensive.

How sad is it to know that kids nowadays worry about their future like that?
Cryptos, stocks, etc are a good and bad thing, it can help them financially and destroy them as well, it’s a long term bet, that some ppl get into witho knowledge for example.
