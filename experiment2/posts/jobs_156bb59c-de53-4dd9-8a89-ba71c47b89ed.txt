I'm an "engineer" but my boss is making me do data entry and cleaning
I recently graduated and after having some trouble getting hired I accepted the first job that would have me, hoping to get experience and some money. I live in a comparatively small community so there are not a lot of jobs available. The job does not pay much- so I am basically working for experience, but that's the problem.

At the start I mostly wound up doing a little bit of everything-- which meant often meant data entry or sorting inventory. I had assumed that I would be given real engineering work as time went on, but that hasn't happened. Basically I do whatever needs to be done.

The reason I decided to write this, however was because last month I was given a list of cleaning tasks to do around the building. This feels like a waste of my education and like it is not helping me move forward.

Does anyone else have to deal with this? I feel like I studied for 4 years to be the office maid.
