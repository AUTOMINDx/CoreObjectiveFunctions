Prestigious job vs relaxing job?
The place I work it is a political organisation. I have been in the same department for years. Recently, I was offered a position at a mire more selective or prestigious part of the organisation. 

* Current job: no career advancement in sigh, but very relaxing, highly flexible to days off, reasonable work hours, small team, friendly managers 

* New job: extremely long work hours, a good career shift on my resume, not flexible, larger team, I come in with the same title and summar, and maybe a future career push, pushes me out of my comfort zone 

I am torn apart in choosing to stay or take the offer.
