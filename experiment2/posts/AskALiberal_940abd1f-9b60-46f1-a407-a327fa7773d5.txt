What are your thoughts on Saule Omarova's proposals to change banking as well as the role of the Fed?
Saule Omarova has proposed establishing a National Investment Authority to divert investments away from the oil and gas industry and into "clean and green" infrastructure projects.

She has stated that "the way we basically get rid of those carbon financiers is we starve them of their sources of capital."

Omarova, the nominee to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has made a policy proposal (in a paper) to "end banking as we know it."

To these ends, Omarova has proposed allowing the Federal Reserve to handle consumer bank deposits, replacing or at least supplementing private banks.

Omarova says her proposed National Investment Authority would serve as the "fighting muscle" of the Green New Deal. Under Omarovaâ€™s proposal, the "National Investment Authority" would create investment funds and issue bonds in order to lure investors to fund clean energy projects, sapping oil and gas projects of their funding.

The agency, which would be similar to the New Deal's RFA, would work closely with the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department, which oversees the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

This would be a departure from the current role of the Fed and also bring the US closer to a Japanese-style "industrial policy."

Good or bad ideas? I could see both sides and am interested in hearing the thoughts of the group as you'all always bring up things I haven't considered!
