I need advice on my (miserably like life)
I don't know, I feel everything until now was never under my own control, I can't keep going on like that. Lofi music is my only source of calm and tranquility but it can't go on forever.  I feel the weight of my controlling mother and my distant father. My sister who was caring for me is now 8000+km away with her own family. Even when I was with her, her life now understandably revolves around her 2 kids and her husband is not welcoming of me. Everytime I start to make some sort of connection with a girl, it always ends up with me being ghosted. It hurts so funking much. I always believed in kindness and helping the next but until now it only brought me pain and suffering.  I just want to end things but I don't want to leave a negative perception onto my family, sister and pool of relatives because I am not an asshole yet. How do I say that I can't,  I am not that capable, please stop putting expectations onto my shoulders, they will bury me underground.  I Love my relatives,  they supported me financially and taught me a lot of things,  so they naturally have some expectations from me. I feel useless,  it's always my strong willed mother to told me and pushed me until this point.  Maybe too far, but who am I to judge.
Even now that I am writing this I feel like crying but can't. I just want the suffering to end. It causes me to be extremely apathetic and to procrastinate.

Maybe one day I will have the courage.
