AITA for criticizing my sister's parenting and not dropping the subject?
My sister and I come from a large family. We have three elder brothers. Our parents focused all their resources on our brothers. They didn't care about my sister and I. My brothers got everything they wanted and my sister and I got the cheapest things possible. They left me alone in the hospital after I broke up arm so that they could watch one of my brother play football. They neglected us emotionally.

My sister and I were able to get out and build a decent life. She is married and has two children ( 16M and 17F). They are sweet kids but I have noticed that she is a bit partial to her daughter. I really didn't think much of it. My nephew visited me. He was depressed and angry. He loves my husband and is super close to him and he teased out that he was upset because his parents had only gotten him a few books for his birthday.  For my niece's 16th birthday they gave her  gifts worth more than 5K. I remember her telling me the amount last year. 

I tried talking to her about it. She keeps shutting me down because I am not a parent and I don't understand what they need. My sister's loves her son, she is not as bad as our parents but it is still bad.  What I understand from what she has said is that she doesn't want to spoil him like my parents spoiled our brothers. They grew up to be terrible human beings and giving my niece experiences which we never got to enjoy. 

I have kept bringing this up every time I visit. She doesn't like talking about it but I keep reminding about how shitty it made us feel when we got $50 gift cards while they got anything they wanted. She has been avoiding me lately and she always gets really upset whenever I bring it up. My nephew liked the books. He would have been really happy with the gifts if it was not for the fact that his sister got a lot more than he did. I just feel like I am blowing up a small issue because of my own upbringing.
