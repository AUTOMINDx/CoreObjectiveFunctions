I thought I enjoyed being alone…
I’m lucky that I’ve always had friends. Despite being an introvert who always prefers to do things by myself I’ve never had trouble making friends. But as I’m sure many others have noticed too, after you hit 30 you don’t really make new friends anymore. You have the friends you made in school and other social gatherings in your youth and it seems close to impossible to make new ones later so you better make sure you don’t lose them. I’ve recently realized I’m losing mine.

As we all are hitting our 30s, life is getting more serious and busy. People are getting married, having kids, are busy with their jobs which means they’re going to spend the little free time that they have with their significant others. And that’s fine. I’m happy that life has turned so good for my friends, I wish nothing but the best for them all. But as someone who is not living a life like that, I’m starting to feel really lonely since I have no one to talk with these days. Like I said, I’m an introvert and prefer to spend most of my time by myself but I’ve always stayed in touch with my friends. We would talk daily, play games together, go out drinking together. I realize now that even though I am a loner I still need those human connections to balance things out.

I guess it was inevitable that things would end up like this. Thankfully I have a job to keep me busy and a dog for company so I’ll manage for now but I doubt things will get any easier in the future.
