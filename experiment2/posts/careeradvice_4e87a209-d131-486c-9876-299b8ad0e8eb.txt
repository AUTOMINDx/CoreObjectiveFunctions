Any job suggestions (outside of Project Management) for a JR PM?
Looking to move away from Project Management - I’ve been in my role as an Associate Project Manager for the financial services industry for two years. 

I primarily work in a governance position for my company’s PMO, closely working with the Head of the department to design and implement operational processes that help improve our KPIs as well as create and present documentation that assists PMs with following enterprise standards to avoid audit breaches, etc. I have also trained JR PMs and supported PMs and Project Deliver Managers and Directors with their work.

I’m no longer interested in becoming a project manager - I think I’d like a lower stress job, I like my current position in governance tbh but looking to change companies as I’ve been with mine for six years. Not sure what kind of job this would be called in other companies

Education: Double major in Psychology &amp; Sociology.

I like analyzing processes and finding better ways/improving them, I like to interact with others and train/support/overall be helpful to them,  I love creating presentations/decks.

Previous job experience has been - Mainframe environment support analyst: I liked automating jobs to make it more efficient (less work for me) but I wanted a more social job as it was quite secluded
- ATM help desk support analyst: I liked helping technicians and talking to people but the job was repetitive and boring, did not challenge my brain, and low salary.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance
