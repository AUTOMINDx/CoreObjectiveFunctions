What do you really think if a woman often texts you first?
So I'm quite simple in this regard, if I like a man and I want to talk to him I will text or call him. We are talking about the "getting to know each other" stage, so asking if they like me or not would probably be too much I think. I heard vastly different things when it comes to this topic, both from men &amp; women. Some say it's clingy, some say you should let the man chase you, some say they would be happy about it, some find it annoying only if they are not that into the girl, which I don't know. For sure, I guess opinions will differ here too, but maybe I will get some clarity from it. 

For clarification, it's not like I'm texting them for months without they initiating, more like for example if he calls me once, I have no problem texting them first, let's say the next 3 or 4 times.
