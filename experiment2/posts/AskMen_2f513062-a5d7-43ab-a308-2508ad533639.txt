Can you explain to me what the friendzone is?
I'm a woman who can never be just friends with a man without them starting to get weird and mentionning the friendzone. Even now that I'm married. Even if the friendship is just catching up online with someone from the past. Every woman around me seems to be able to have guy friends without them being weird about it. By weird I mean, thinking that just because I'm being nice to them, I must want something from them. Even tho they know I'm married. And when I make it clear that I want nothing and just wanna be friendly, they seem disappointed and won't talk to me anymore. 
I'm an average looking woman and not flirty at all with them. What am I doing wrong ??? What's the difference between being friends and being "friendzoned"???
