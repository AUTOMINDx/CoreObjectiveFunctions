Should I pay my landlord?
I'm a first-time renter, got a new job that needed me to move closer to work so I did.  I lived in a tiny home and things were okay but not great when I first moved in (the previous tenant didn't clean it and neither did the landlord).  There was also a ceiling fan that wasn't wired to a remote or a switch so it couldn't be turned off (was told that would be addressed after I moved in and it never was). On top of this, I never signed a physical contract for renting from that landlord, it was only verbal.  After living there a month or so, two of the overhead lights that are recessed into the ceiling went out (one directly over the oven and the other in the shower).  I notified my landlord and the issue was never addressed.  Fast forward to now, I moved out on thanksgiving and gave my landlord a 30-day notice like I was asked to and I vacated early after cleaning the whole home. 
When I gave my notice, I told my landlord to keep my security deposit because of the issues with the home listed above and I was hoping that would cover me for the next month. But according to my landlord, I need to pay next month's rent even if I am not living in the home anymore, the only way to circumvent this is if they get a new renter at the start of next month.  
Would I be an asshole if I didn't pay?
