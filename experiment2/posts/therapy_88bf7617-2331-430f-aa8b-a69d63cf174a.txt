Why am I so mad?
Most of my life I’ve been a relatively calm and nice person never got into any fights or was mean or anything of the such. I was very happy and then I got into a relationship and I was in it for 4 years and the last year of it was rough. I’m now out of that relationship and it’s been about 8 months. I used to get into verbal disagreements almost daily for a year with my ex and now that we’re split up I’m always angry and always starting shit with people. I don’t want to be angry and I don’t want to fight or argue but I keep having this urge to be an asshole or escalate things with another male to try and get into a fight but now I’m with another girl and I’m getting upset over such little things and I just don’t want to be mad or angry and argumentative. Help, wtf is wrong with me?
