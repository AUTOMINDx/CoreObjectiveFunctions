How to carry the conversation?
At work, with friends, or in general, I can add some comments that immediately come to mind and bounce off some questions or if I'm lucky some jokes. But often times I don't say anything for a couple reasons :
I can't think of anything to respond with.
When I do, I feel like it adds nothing of value to the conversation and it's rather dumb, irrelevant, or awkward.
But I hate the silence and being told to talk more, and not be so quiet. I literally don't know how, when there are people with exceptional social skills around me and makes me feel inept. My coworkers are servers so it's their job to talk to people, and they want to make me one because I'm fast and a great worker, but the socialising I'm severly lacking in.

How do you practise responding to someone and not remaining silent?? I have anxiety (not social), so I think the fact I care a great deal about what others think is playing a huge role here.
