DAE notice the mood change pattern? I will feel good, but then something random triggers me and I will be in this dark place again
I started noticing this pattern. When I finally get out of this dark place, I start to feel good for a while and then I always start to wonder whether I'm exaggerating and overreacting. Sooner or later I notice this gradual decline of "happiness/well-being" and then something random triggers me and all the crying and everything starts all over again.

I hope I was able to explain what I feel and I hope I'm not the only person who feels this way?
