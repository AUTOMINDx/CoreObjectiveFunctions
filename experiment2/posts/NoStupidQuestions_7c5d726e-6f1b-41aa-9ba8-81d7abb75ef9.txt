Why is the diving/fake injury aspect of football not dealt with as it should be?
Literally every match I’ve ever watched multiple players cry wolf about how injured they are, likening it to a pantomime. Whether it’s diving, rolling around, playing dead or acting like they’ve had their legs snapped, why is it not more heavily dealt with by the ref? It’s blatantly obvious it’s all an act and it’s quite frankly embarrassing, yet free kicks and penalties will be handed out as consolations? Why the fuck is it not dealt with properly? Why doesn’t the ref just tel them to get up and stop acting like a dickhead? Embarrassing all round
