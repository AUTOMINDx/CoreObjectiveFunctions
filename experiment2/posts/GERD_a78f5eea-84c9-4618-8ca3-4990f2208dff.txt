I am capable of voluntary regurgitation, Is it bad? (Warning: Might Disgust Some Individual)
I am a 19 year old healthy male, What you just read in the title is correct, it's not a typo nor this post is to waste time of others or seek unhealthy attention, I got some serious concerns, if you could hear me out and maybe help me understand myself a little more, It will mean a lot since I have never spoken about this to anyone before, literally no one...

I don't remember when I first did it but I've been doing it since I was a kid, I haven't faced any issues whatsoever related to stomach, digestion or throat like I stated, I'm a healthy guy in general, It usually happens when I eat too much and have enough water for the flow to be sutable to perform backflow,  I can pretty much feel it in my stomach when I can perform it or not and yeah It's in MY true will to do it or not.. It NEVER accidently happened, not even once..

I remember as a kid before going to school I would use this trick to fake "vomiting" my breakfast so I could skip school or re-eat sweets that I loved (I know it's disgusting but that's just the truth and I'm coming forward.) I didn't use this much since I didn't will to give out too much about my "little secret"I grew up doing this as an adult and never once questioned it but today when I used this for first time as a "trick" again since my childhood, I had to do the research. I have gym tommorow morning and I had chicken in the evening and dinner which is far too heavy meal for me to perform gym in the morning, So I did what I can, I threw up the "extra" food I had making my stomach feel empty again.  


Conclusion: Even though I've been living by doing this for years, basically my whole life and doing it feels so normal as breathing, I am still concerned about what causes this and is this even something that people have found to be diagnosed with, Please help reddit. Thanks
