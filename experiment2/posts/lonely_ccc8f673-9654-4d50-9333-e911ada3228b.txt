Everybody I reach out to either becomes a bully or ignores me
I genuinely try to be the best person I can for people. I’ve tried to talk to 3 people this year and they all fucked me over. I know 3 isn’t a lot but it’s hard for me to talk to people because of the panic attacks I get while I do it. I don’t know if it’s my fault, I don’t think it is though… ugh
