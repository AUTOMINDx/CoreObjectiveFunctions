AITA For wanting to use snap traps instead of humane traps for mice
I’m going to try and keep this short and sweet. I live in a uni house with my girlfriend of 3 years. We recently found out we have mice living in our kitchen in a hole in the wall. There are at least 3, today I went to put out snap traps after seeing one in the dining room, my GF got upset because she doesn’t want to kill them, we get into a huge fight, she’s crying, I think she’s being unreasonable as she tries to pick up the traps.

We’re both going home for Christmas around the 15th, so we need to get a hold of this mice problem by then. We are now both not talking to each other, she thinks I’m being a horrible person, I think she’s being unreasonable. She also wants to get humane traps, which I don’t see the point as we already have these.

Edit: also worth noting, the landlord supplied 2 traps that are boxes filled with poison. Which ironically she has no problem with.

Opinions ?  I have tried to keep it short and sweet but keeping the main points.
