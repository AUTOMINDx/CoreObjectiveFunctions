How to trust again when your partner cheated ?
To make it short, he cheated on me with two girls before visiting me a week after. Discovered it myself because i felt something was off. We're on a distance relationship so it's even harder to deal with this. 

Every time he's away, or receiving a lot of texts, it remind me of the excuses he said back then to talk/call with theses girls. 

So, how can I deal with this without hurting myself more ? And for the people who forgave after being cheated on, how do you rebuild a relationship ?
