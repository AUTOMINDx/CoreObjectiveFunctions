How do I have a breakdown
I am M22 and I’ve been struggling with my life the past few months. A lot has happened to me and I’ve become secretly depressed and anxiety and work is beyond stressful. I have the responsibilities of a 40 year old and feel like I have the mind of a 17 year old.

Growing up I had a terrible childhood and I have to anther at a very young age. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger however I’m no longer on meds now that I’ve graduated high-school. 

Additionally I know this may seem ignorant but I truly believe I have some of the worst luck out of anyone I know. Something is always going wrong when I think it will go right  and each month seems to get more and more difficult to live through. One month I got Covid, the next I got into a car crash, the one after that I found out I needed two root cancels and insurance didn’t cover, the next after that student loans said I owe them more than what was quoted, etc. 

I feel like I need a big breakdown of a night where I left all of my emotions flow but I just can’t seem to cry. I mean I tear up here and there but never a full on breakdown like I know I need. I know I have one built up inside me but I can’t seem to cry. I think it’s becasue I haven’t allowed myself to since a young age and I need guidance on how I can open my emotions and let out everything.
