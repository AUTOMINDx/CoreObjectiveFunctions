[Monsters, Inc/Monsters at Work] What does Sulley even do now?
They say that he's the CEO now, but in "Monsters at Work" we practically never see him doing any work. Like, at all. Most of what he does is just hanging around the ~~Scare~~ Laugh Floor, while Mike (and others) do the actual work. He's not even Mike's assistant, like how Mike was to Sulley in the first film. Does he even have a job now?
