AITA for putting my 16 year old daughter in charge?
I have 2 kids, 16 and 17 both f. Recently, we had an extended family gathering, except it was pretty much just my brothers’ families coming over for a couple of days. 

A little context about my daughters, my 17 year old is, in my opinion as her parent, very irresponsible. She often doesn’t think things through and she isn’t very bright. She has other qualities which are all lovely, but the truth is that she doesn’t possess much common sense at times. In life, she is often forgetful and is prone to making rash decisions. 

Our other daughter is very smart, both book and street wise. She thinks things through very quickly and is much sharper than her sister, and at times, us as well. I can see it in her daily life, where she doesn’t make dumb mistakes like forgetting to clean her room, or take her homework to school. 

Recently, all of us adults wanted to go out and we were leaving several kids, all above the age of 11 at home alone. My kids are the oldest and I was asked to put someone in charge so that they could enjoy their night stress free. We ordered pizza for them and we all unanimously decided that 16 will be in charge for the night. 

Basically we gave her power to decide what everyone was watching, because we trusted her to make things fair, and we gave her the power to decide when everyone was going to bed and basically just make decisions about the house while we were gone. 

17 became very angry and upset, yelling about how humiliating it was for her to have her little sister be her boss. She yelled and ran up to her room and slammed the door. We went out for the night and came back to a very calm and peaceful night. 16 had done a wonderful job and made sure everyone was in line. 17 still refuses to speak to us today. This was all 3 nights ago. I tried to explain to my daughter why I put 16 in charge, but she wasn’t having it. 

AITA?
