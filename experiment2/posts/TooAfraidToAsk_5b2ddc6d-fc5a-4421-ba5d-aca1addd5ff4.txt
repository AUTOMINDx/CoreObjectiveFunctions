What does it feel like to be skinny after being fat?
Those who have lost any amount of weight and has gotten to a body weight where they would consider themselves "skinny" or of an average weight, what does it feel like to be "skinny?" I have been overweight my entire life (23 M 5'11" 230 lbs), to the point that I cannot really conceive of what it feels like to be "skinny." Day to day life is impacted by my body weight naturally, to the point that I do not know of life any other way. I've asked friends of mine who have lost considerable amounts of weight and the consensus is essentially that it is freeing, which of course makes sense. I wanted to pose the question here to continue to motivate myself to keep working at it and see what people's experiences were before and after weight loss.

-What does it feel like to simply get up and walk around? Having gone from being overweight to in shape, do you find that it literally and physically feels lighter?

-Do you find yourself regulating your body temperature better? In the wintertime, I have to consider the layers I'm wearing and try to reach a balance of 'will keep me just warm enough while outside' and 'wont cause a convection oven effect that lasts for hours after going inside.' Do you find that this is less of an issue now that you've lost weight?

-Conversely, are the summer times a little less unbearable?

-Have you found that your quality of sleep has been affected/improved?

-Have you found that your overall mood/outlook on life has improved?

-Are you happier?

-Do you physically feel healthier?


-Despite whatever it may say about society, have you found that people around you treat you differently/better than before you lost weight?

I would appreciate any and all responses, and I've spent considerable time deciding whether to post this at all. I figured that there are many of us who feel the same way -- stuck in a rut in regards to working out and losing weight, because we consciously or subconsciously can't even picture what a healthy 'me' would look like.
