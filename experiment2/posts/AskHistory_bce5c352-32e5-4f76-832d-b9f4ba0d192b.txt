History final
Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm taking a history final this Wednesday and I'm pretty stressed about it. For the test I need to know all about the two world wars, the cold war, the great depression, the revolutions in Russia and Spain, as well as the history of my own country (Iceland) + some more stuff. 

How should I be approaching this test? Do you have any advice on how I can memorize everything? 

Any advice and help would be greatly appreciated :)
