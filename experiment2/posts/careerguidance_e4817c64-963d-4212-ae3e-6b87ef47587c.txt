Don’t know what my next move in life is?
I graduated with a bachelor’s in psychology and then I soon realized that the psych field wasn’t for me. I’ve been stuck in life for years and don’t know what my next move is. I’m 28 and still living with my parents because I want a career in life and not a job. I want to go back to school for dental hygiene (which was my first major before I switched to psychology, dumb me) but you have to have good, clear communication which I struggle with. I’m not sure if I will even pass the interviews because of this. Also, if I go back to school, that’ll be another 4 years and I would be done at 32 which kinda sucks but I can deal with it. I just need guidance and advice. I don’t really know what to do. I don’t know what to do or go for
