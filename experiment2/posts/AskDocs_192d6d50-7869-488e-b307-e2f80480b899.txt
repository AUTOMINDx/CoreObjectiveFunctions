20 year old, man, 6’0, 182 pounds | should I see the doctor?
Before I begin, I don’t have health insurance (until 2022 because I moved to a different state and had to apply for new one). For the few weeks I’ve been off and on sick. In my previous more northern state, I was never sick this much in my life. But the past few weeks I’ve been vomiting and having diarrhea off and on, I’ve also had a fever off and on, and I was okay with that at first because it would go away rather quickly and I just assumed I was over doing the gym and drinking plus being outside during this time of the year with the Santa Ana wins in Southern California. But I started to get concerned this week when I started to experience pain in my muscles, my hamstrings hurt and my upper buttocks/lower back hurt as well. It’s concerning because I’ve skipped the gym for well over a week now trying to get better but it’s not working. It also hurts my neck a bit to look down but it’s not excruciating. What’s excruciating is the head ache I had 3 days ago that is still kinda mildly affecting me right now. I also forgot to mention I’ve been having off and on fever. I tested negative for Covid so I know it’s not that. Should I see a doctor anyways or is it probably not serious?
