[DC Comics] Are there only 104 Universes in the entire Multiverse?
If you look in my post and comment history, you’ll figure out pretty quickly that I know about and like Marvel Comics much more than their main competitor, DC Comics. But there’s been a question that’s bothered me for a while… How many Universes actually still exist in the Multiverse?

(Forgive me if I’m wrong about any of this, but I do not know much.)

So I was watching a video about the Batman Who Laughs and learned about the Dark Multiverse, which is apparently dark counterparts of all the Universes in the Multiverse. But after the New 52, the explanations of the Multiverse make it seem like there are only 52 Universes in the regular Multiverse. Then adding on the Dark 52 (which is probably not what they’re called), that makes only 104. Is that all there is in the Multiverse?
