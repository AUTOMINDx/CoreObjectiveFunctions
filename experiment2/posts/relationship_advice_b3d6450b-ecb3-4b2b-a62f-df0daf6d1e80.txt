My friends from university are anti-vax and anti-masks, and I don't know what to do about it.
The problem is that I'm tired of arguing with people who I know can use their brains, but for some reason they aren't taking covid-19 seriously. At all. 

They bring up stupid arguments like "don't you feel stupid for wearing a mask and getting vaccinated but we're still in the covid-19 pandemic 
"..? I'm sorry, what? And "I'm not taking a vaccine that only lasts a few months".. I swear, these guys are smart, very good at their jobs, but the things they say really makes me doubt that. Also really weird, they "don't want their blood to be infected by the vaccine".. Whatever the fuck that means. 

The funny thing is, before the first lockdowns happened, 1 of these guys got masks to wear in public before masks were required to guard against the spread. But then U.S. politicians turned covid-19 into a farce, and now they're dumber than rocks when it comes to covid-19. We aren't even living in the U.S. but the right wing media from there has a grip on them. 

Now I've known this for years, and I could live with their rather dumb far right U.S. political rhetoric, cause "it's just a joke bro". But what I can't live with is being friends with people who are actively propagating the struggle we have with this pandemic. I really need to leave this group, but these guys are the only friends I have.

I can stay and argue with them to try to change their minds, but I'm tired of doing that with people. 

I don't know what to do.

Edit: I'm fully vaccinated and wear masks everywhere in public.
