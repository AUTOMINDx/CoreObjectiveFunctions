I wish I had the courage.
I wish I could stop being the person everyone expects me to be. I wish someone could see the sadness behind my eyes. Realize that I work so hard to drive away any thoughts that make me realize I’m not ok.

Maybe I’ve been watching too much Bojack Horseman &amp; I’m fu*~ed up rn. Who knows:)
