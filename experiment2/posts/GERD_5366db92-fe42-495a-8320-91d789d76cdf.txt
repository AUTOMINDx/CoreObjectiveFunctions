Acid rebound question
So I've been on PPIs for about 10 years and have to stop now (I developed polyps due to them). I'm down to 20 MG of pantoprazole and about to start on them every other day. Things are going well except for one specific issue that I am concerned about getting worse.

When I deficate it burns like I ate very spicy food. It's uncomfortable but isn't yet painful. I'm worried that might get worse or possibly cause damage. I have changed my diet a lot (not fatty or fried food at all, proper fiber intake and hydration, no chocolate, ect) so there is not much I can do on that front to reduce acid. I know rebound is a big issue with quitting and it's going to suck, but has anyone else had this? Any advice?
