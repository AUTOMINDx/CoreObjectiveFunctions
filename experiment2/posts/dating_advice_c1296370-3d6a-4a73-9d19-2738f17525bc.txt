How would you ask for verification for someone you're trying to meet?
I've fallen into a hole where I am jumping from dating site to dating site and trying to find some casual stuff or flings (AFF,AM,True Hookup etc.). 

And I believe I am respectful and polite, I don't use vulgar terms because that seems pretty rude to a stranger you don't know. But I have asked on different occasions that people verify themselves somehow, (I usually ask if they can hold up their hand and hold a certain number of fingers) and so many of them get so angry and leave the convo or try to ignore the request and talk about "what I would do to them" "how i would do this" blah blah blah. 

I don't ask them to show their face, just the finger gestures, and I offer to do the same if they would like.

So am I being a dick here, or is this a clear sign of catfishing? Is there a better way to verify or should you just say screw it and continue with the convo.
