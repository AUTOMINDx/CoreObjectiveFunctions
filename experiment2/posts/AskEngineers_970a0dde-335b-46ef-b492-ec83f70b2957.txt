What does a Systems Engineer do ?
Currently some DoD contractors recruiters are contacting me on linkedin asking me to apply to Systems Eng. II roles at their companies. My background has mainly been Quality and Continuous Improvement Engineering roles. I am very happy at my current job and not looking to change anytime soon. I just wanted to see what that role entails ?
