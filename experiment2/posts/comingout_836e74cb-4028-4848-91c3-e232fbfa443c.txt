The Struggle of Just Being
Hi there my first post on this app so sorry if it isn’t the most concrete and doesn’t completely make sense. I’m Latino M 18yr old from California struggling with my sexuality it’s been a road to even come here. I questioned my sexuality for years and finally came to to some type of term with it over the quarantine. Dated a guy who I thought was good but treated me like shit at the end and left me feeling worse than ever before. During that time I was going through a really bad depression hole and so when he dumped me it just got worse. I worked up the courage through that to come out to friends as the weight had become to hard to carry and people noticed I wasn’t myself. Even with that tho the load was unbearable and so I came to the point of coming out to my mom. She is a very religious woman as most are in Mexican household and has given me a very mixed approach making me go back into a spiral. That being said she was not okay but did not kick me out which was lucky but left me feeling worse. She has told me she believe I won’t go to hell but that this “choice” I’ve made isn’t okay. Most people in this community don’t believe in god but I do which some might find strange but it’s what I grew up with and find it hard to believe an all living god hates me for loving someone. I have started dating someone new over the last few months and when she found out she was not happy and has banned him from the house. I feel sad and alone and going into a spiral I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with the religious parents and how everyone else deals with it thanks for reading
