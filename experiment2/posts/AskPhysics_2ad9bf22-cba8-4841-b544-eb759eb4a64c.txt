Question about finding components of a resultant force
Hi there, I am having trouble with a textbook question that I was hoping to get some help with!

&amp;#x200B;

"Resolve the horizontal 600 N force into components acting along the u and v axes and determine the magnitudes of these components. "

&amp;#x200B;

I understand how to calculate the magnitude for u because it can be made into a right angled triangle which I have done in previous questions, I am just a little lost when it comes to resolving the magnitude for v. 

Is it as simple as just using sine and cosine rules after finding u? That was the first thing I tried but I am not super confident in my answer and I am not sure if there is a good way to check if both magnitudes are correct.

Thank you for any help you can give!
