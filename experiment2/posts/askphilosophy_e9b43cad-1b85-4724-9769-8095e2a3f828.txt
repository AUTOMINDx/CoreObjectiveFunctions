On Jean Paul Sartres Claim About Meaning
Sartre claims that expectation is the problem, and that we should not expect meaning and we will not be disappointed, but I believe that not expecting meaning in life is almost like to not expecting love from a lover. Are you supposed to simply stay and endure the lack of love from that which is supposed to give it in its very nature?
