Only with this position 5 months. How do I not bad-mouth my current employer during interviews?
I regret taking this position in July for a 10-15 person company, reporting directly to the CEO. The work is great but I hate the job overall and am trying to get out. Warning signs before I even was offered came from the others interviewing me being upfront that the CEO could be difficult to work with/for, but I thought I’d be good enough to work around it. I should have taken the advice and backed out honestly. 

The main issues for me is that this role was described as hybrid, “there’s no reason you’d have to be in the office everyday” (they were remote during the interview process) but it’s 5 months later and he’s still making everyone come in 5 days a week. WFH is discouraged and he keeps giving me the run around when I ask for a day from home, or just some flexibility. 

He also implied during my offer that insurance would kick in once I’m a company employee, then when I got there I actually had to wait 90+ days. This caused me a ton of issues because I wasn’t prepared for this lapse and have some basic medical annoyances I have to keep an eye on and maintain. 

Now I’ve been having issues with getting him to allow me to work from home vs use Sick time. I was sick a couple weeks ago with gross symptoms, waiting in a PCR result, and didn’t feel comfortable enough to commute by bus or sit in the office with my colleagues all day, but I was functional enough to work from home, but he still made me use my very little sick leave and take the day off. 

The rigidity is just needless and people have already quit since I got here because of these types of things. I feel like these are all solid reasons to be looking for something new so fast, but I don’t want to come off as whiny and entitled. For context I have about 7 years of professional work experience.
