AITA For Arguing with the Airline Rep
We were flying home from Thanksgiving with my parents. I live in a big city and am used to dealing with air travel at a busy airport. I always check in and pay for checked luggage the day before. Then we print bag tags and boarding passes at one of those kiosks. 

Today we tried to follow our usual routine, but the kiosk didn't print the bag tags, so we ended having to get in the check in line. When we got to the front, the rep tried to charge us for a bag. I told her we had already paid for all three bags and I pulled up the receipt to show her. She insisted we had to pay, and before I could continue to explain that she was mistaken, my husband pulled out his credit card and said we'd just pay it. 

I was pissed. I had proof of payment right in front of her and she wouldn't listen and spoke to me like I was being irrational. I tried to  argue with my husband but he kept insisting it didn't matter. 

As we continued checking in she said the system was trying to charge us for all three bags. Finally she looked at the receipt and got a manager to help her override the system. We still had to pay an additional $40 that I'm sure we'll have to jump through a million hoops to get back.

I don't feel like I was ta, but my husband and this lady made me feel like one, so I'm seeking further opinions. AITA
