My (22F) parents won’t let me go on trips or sleepovers due to their paranoia.
Please see my history post for this one. I’m almost 23 years old and never gotten to go on a trip or spend the night with a friend or partner ever. My parents are extremely strict and paranoid people. I wanted to go spend the night with my partner but since my parents are so strict that I can’t even have a partner in the first place. I’ve spoken to my mom, said I was going on a trip with a friend. She said be careful but then changed her mind saying that I’ll get kidnapped and that my organs will get cut up and sold. She claims that even tho I’m an adult, the world isn’t safe and I could get killed. We did not have any of this vibe when I went on a trip with my sister but know that she knows I won’t go with family, she’s paranoid. In my teens, I never got to do anything fun because of my mother’s paranoia and the fact she can’t trust anyone even tho she claims to trust us. 

I don’t understand why she’s like this and I can’t seem to do anything fun. I’m an adult and therefore I think my mom should just trust me and accept the fact that I’m not a kid anymore. I don’t know what to do. Please don’t tell me to sneak out, my mom will for sure file a missing persons report on me. 

I’m really torn between having fun and pleasing my mom and I can’t seem to calm her down.
