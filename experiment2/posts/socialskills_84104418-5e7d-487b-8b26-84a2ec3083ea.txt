How do I become more assertive and create boundaries with people?
Recently, I went away from my home and upon returning home, a few days later, I noticed that my flatmate had been in my room. We’re not super close so this isn’t normal for us. She asked if she could borrow something over text &amp; I forgot to reply. I’ve even said to her in the past that I don’t like people going in my room when I’m not there, as it feels like an invasion of my privacy. 
I’m a bit of a people pleaser and I always worry about what other people are thinking or feeling; sometimes I get very frustrated because I feel like I let people walk all over me, which does nothing for my self esteem :(. What should I do to set some boundaries in place?
