Does 'fake it till you make it' really work?
So basically title. It seems some of the most common advice on here is the 'fake it til you make it' approach, but does that really work? Can anyone attest to this actually working?

I say this because I feel as humans we are attuned to people acting sketchy or strange and I myself can think of several instances where someone was acting a little bit off or seemed like they were trying to force a conversation. 

I just feel like it would get immediately noticed if I suddenly tried to change into a more social person.
