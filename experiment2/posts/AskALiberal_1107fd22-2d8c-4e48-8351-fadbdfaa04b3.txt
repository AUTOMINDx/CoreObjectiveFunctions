Should Biden lessen the sanctions on Afghanistan?
I a huge supporter of Biden ending a 20 year long war and bringing the troops home from Afghanistan.

I also recognize that his admin pulled out more people in 2 weeks in one of the largest airlifts in history.

But right now 38 million Afghans are suffering, materially suffering under the weight of US sanctions.

&gt;Earlier this month, the World Health Organization warned that around 3.2  million children were likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in  Afghanistan by the end of the year — one million of whom at risk of  dying as temperatures drop.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Afghanistan  has long been dependent on imports for basic foods, fuel and  manufactured goods, a lifeline that was severed after neighboring  countries closed their borders during the Taliban’s military campaign  this summer. Trade disruptions have since caused shortages of crucial  goods, like medicine, while the collapse of financial services has  strangled traders who rely on U.S. dollars and bank loans for imports.  
&gt;  
&gt;At  the Hairatan port along the Afghanistan-Uzbekistan border, a team of  workers unloaded flour bags from a shipping container into trucks,  sending clouds of white specks into the air. Since August, their company  has slashed its imports in half; people can no longer afford basic goods.  
&gt;  
&gt;And the scope of the exemptions is limited in other ways. Many foreign banks that aid organizations rely on to transfer funds into Afghanistan have cut ties to Afghan banks for fear of running afoul of sanctions. And the liquidity crisis severely restrains the amount that organizations can withdraw to pay vendors or aid workers.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The current economic restrictions and sanctions policy, if maintained and not adjusted, are on track to hurt the Afghan people — through deprivation and famine — more than the Taliban’s brutalities and poor governance,” said John Sifton, the Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.  
&gt;  
&gt;Already in hospitals across the country are signs of a hunger crisis that could overwhelm the fragile health care system.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a malnutrition ward of a hospital in southern Afghanistan, Shukria, 40, sat with her 1-year-old grandson, Mahtab, his mouth craned open but body too weak to let out a cry.  
&gt;  
&gt;For weeks, the boy’s father had come home empty-handed from his mechanic shop as business dried up, and the family resorted to bread and tea for every meal. Soon his mother stopped producing milk to breastfeed, so she and Shukria supplemented his diet with milk from their family’s goat. But when they ran out of cash to buy food, they sold the animal.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’ve been asking this hospital to give me work,” Shukria said. “Otherwise after a week, a month, he will just end up sick and back here.”

It seems like we are trying to pull on Afghanistan what the Saudis did to Yemen. I think it is well past time to lift many of the sanctions especially since [large parts of Afghanistan is in drought](https://www.ifrc.org/press-release/afghanistan-over-80-country-serious-drought) due to abnormally low rainfall. Hundreds of thousands to many millions will die in the coming months if we do not remove the sanctions.

Taliban rule over Afghanistan. They seem to have [higher accuracy when targeting ISIS-K](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taliban-say-forces-destroy-islamic-state-cell-hours-after-kabul-blast-2021-10-04/) then [we do](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html). No one sees the value in a part 2 to the Afghanistan War. So we might as well do our part to minimize the human suffering. And we can still use the threat of sanctions to ensure the Taliban continues to cooperate in allowing people to leave Afghanistan if they want to.
