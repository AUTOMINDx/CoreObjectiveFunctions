AITA for falling asleep at Thanksgiving?
I can see why my wife is upset, but I also don't think what I did is worth getting mad about. 

For Thanksgiving we went to my wife's parents house, per usual. After appetizers my wife went out to drink a little wine and reconnect and jus talk with some relatives. Our older two sons (5 years and 2 years) were playing with some cousins and I was holding our youngest son (three months), who had fallen asleep and when he falls asleep, he will immediately wake up if I or his mom or anybody else holding him gives him to someone else. 

I couldn't help out with cooking or play with the kids, the only thing on tv was football and I'm not a sports guy, everybody was either cooking or talking about subjects I had no idea about so I sat down in the living room and I just kinda dozed off. I woke up bedore my wife came back in but I guess someone told my wife and now she's kinda upset with me for choosing to fall asleep instead of talking to the people there or finding something else to do. 

Especially since it was a day of family and thanks.

Edited because of wrong age.
