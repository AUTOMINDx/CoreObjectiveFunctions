Cried at my new job, ughhhh.
This is more embarrassment than a vent, I just don't know what flair to use.

I got a new job as a kitchen hand, and today was my first day. I've worked as one before but due to this place being completely new to me it's like starting all over again, so I was slower than I wanted to be and kept messing up. I'm also used to "never just stand around" but due to being knew I often didn't know what to do which resulted me in standing around, which made my mind panic.

 I'm very anxious to keep this job so every time I messed up I felt my heart sank. The job itself isn't bad and the people are lovely I was just overwhelmed remembering and learning so many new things.

Anyway so I was bring coffee to someone (there's only 3  including me people working here so I did a lot of waitressing as well) and the barista didn't put the lid on properly, so the coffee spilt, I have to admit that sort of send me over so after getting the mop and a new coffee I went to the back to do some dishes and distract myself. Unfortunately it didn't work and I started tearing up, even worse my boss was right next to me. Luckily he was extremely nice about it, compared to my old boss who would tell me things like "never ever show any bad feelings at work EVER"

But that's the first time I've ever cried at a job, even with having rude bosses/managers and having even more demanding jobs.
