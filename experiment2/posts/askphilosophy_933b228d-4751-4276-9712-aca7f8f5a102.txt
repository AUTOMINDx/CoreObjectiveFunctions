What defines right and wrong?
This was just a conversation I had with friends and i’m wondering what others thing of it. What defines universally what is right and wrong? My friend used the example of hitler, his beliefs were wrong. And i agree and it seems the majority feel the same way, but hitler thought what he was doing was right, so did the people that followed him. So even if the general population believe that his beliefs were wrong can anyone really set in stone that is was wrong? I feel maybe the majority of people can come together and decide yes that was wrong but nazis still exist today and they obviously don’t agree with the general population so isn’t it all just a matter of ones opinion? Another example was about laws and how killing people is illegal in the US (in most cases) and is just seen as a bad thing. These laws are set in stone but are only exclusive to the US and were put together by the people who wrote the constitution and manage laws today based off of what THEY think. They put this together and decided that some things are wrong and some are right but not everyone agrees with these laws so is killing another person really just universally right or wrong all the across the board? I want to learn more about this viewpoint i have. Maybe i’m missing some things or there is a term to describe my thinking i’m just looking to learn.
