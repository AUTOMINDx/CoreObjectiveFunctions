I tried tinder and got zero matches, am I too ugly to get a girlfriend
I downloaded tinder and set up my profile, posted some pictures that I had taken on one of my recent trips. I live in India but unfortunately I haven't been getting likes and matches, what do I do to change the profile and is it that I'm too ugly to match with a girl
