To everyone else who’s abusers are/were also their caretakers: On the normal days, when things were seemingly okay, did you also find yourselves unable to stand your abuser? And full of an overwhelming urge to be an ass??
I still live with my abuser as I’m a minor, and today was, of course, a “normal” day, and when she did stuff as simple as ask how I slept or if I had read a book she liked, I was just filled with annoyance and fury. I would snap at her for literally just trying to make small talk, like her very presence is driving me up the wall. Could this be CPTSD related? Is it some way for my brain to compensate for the shit she’s put me through and said to me? I get blamed and shamed like I’m just so mean to her for no reason. But it feels deeper. It feels like I can’t quite switch over to the “Let’s pretend everything is fine and we’re all just happy and normal” mindset because the other night she was telling me I was the reason she didn’t want to live anymore. Am I just an awful person and an awful daughter??
