When my friends say that I’m one of their favorite people or I’m their best friend…
I have this brief moment of disbelief where I want to say “But you don’t even know me that well.” Or “ You only say that because I do nice things for you.”

I get really upset and feel empty inside.

Like these people don’t know me at all or ask about me on a personal level despite us being in the same vicinity for a couple years.

It occur to me recently I’m the one always planning or going to them, and I’m sick of it and sick of em. 

And I don’t know what to do, other than nod and smile.
