Trouble breathing?
Does anyone have a feeling like something is stuck in their throat, like itâ€™s not too bad but it can he annoying and sometimes trouble breathing. I was diagnosed with GERD a week ago and took some medication so it got better a tiny little bit. Does anyone know how or how long will it go away? Thank you so much
