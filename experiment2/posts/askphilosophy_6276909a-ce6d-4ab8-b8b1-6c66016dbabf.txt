Are there established terms for the different types of self?
So philosophically speaking, there seem to be many different types of “self”. Some examples that come to mind are

1. The self that we come to when considering Cartesian doubt. We cannot say anything about this self except that it is.

2. The self that exists upon introspection. This is the self that seems to house our desires and feelings.

3. The self that exists when we are engaged in some sort of action. This is more of a sort of unconscious self, where when we are engrossed in an action or project, we are not introspecting at all, and it’s almost like that self which holds feelings and desires is not there anymore, and we are one with the task at hand. We exist as we act, but this existence seems almost different to when we are introspecting.

I’m sure there are other types of self that are also defined, so I was wondering if there are established terms to distinguish between these selves?
