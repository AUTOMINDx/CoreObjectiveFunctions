I want to kill myself because of my brother
I am in my mid 20s and I have been abused by my older brother(late 30s) since I was a first grader.
I got beat up in front of my friends and I remember the next day, everybody ignored me in school.
I have been having suicidal thoughts since I was 10 or something. I even wrote a note.

Now my dad committed suicide after he got beat up by my brother a few months ago. And yeah, he was abusive too.

I live with my mom and brother. I lost my job a few months ago and have been failing job interviews since.

I want to get out of here so bad but I do not have enough money nor job. But I’m still paying for the house mortgage.

The scent of him, the look of him drive me crazy. I want him out of the house but my mother is very protective of him, taking his side.

My mother does know I got beat up because one day when I was in college, he beat me up and ripped up all my clothes because one of his shirts was missing. So I called the police. But I am damn sure she had known, I remember telling her this since I was very young. But whenever I address this she will be like “you’re being dramatic. Just let go what happened, happened”

Now I’m stuck here with this piece of shit family, paying the mortgage from my almost non-existent savings, having no job, failing interviews, I just want to die.

But the only thing that’s keeping me alive is my dog. Because without me, I know she has no one to take care of her.

I have searched for a place where I cann put her up for an adoption, but she is a mud, has a condition(she seizers), a big sized dog, no one wants her.

I am stuck. What can I do?
Sorry if I didn’t make myself clear. English isn’t my first language.
