How have y’all said “fuck shame” lately?
Content warning for brief mention of CSA. 


I’m curious about some of your proud moments in which you’ve been able to say fuck shame. I recently told me best friend about sexual trauma I experienced as a kid, which I had only ever mentioned to my therapist. 

I also recently had a conversation with my therapist about sexual interests without getting a total vulnerability hangover. 

A lot of progress I’m making I think is because my therapist is the safest person I’ve ever connected to and I feel all my parts are accepted by her.
