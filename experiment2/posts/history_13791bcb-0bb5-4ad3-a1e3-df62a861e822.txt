How did nations communicate pre-digital communication.
I'm wondering how nations communicated in the past. Particullary in the middle ages and early middle period. They would have send messengers on horseback to a receiving nation but where did those messengers go to? Did nations in the past have a departement where they could deliver their message? What did countries in the past communicate about; except for declarations of war, alliances or eranged marriages?
