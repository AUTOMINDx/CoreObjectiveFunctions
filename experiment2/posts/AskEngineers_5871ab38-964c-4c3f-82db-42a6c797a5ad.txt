Polymer scientist/ engineer wanting work from home job, where should I start?
Hello All,

I am currently working as a polymer engineer (experienced with plastics, rubber).  I have nearly 10 yrs of experience and an advanced degree in the field.   I go to work onsite everyday due to company policy and the practicalities of my role.  I'm looking for inspiration on how can I shift my career so that I can at least work from home part time, not even full time.

Some ideas: becoming a document review engineer? Any other thoughts? I would really appreciate some peer insights.
