Hi can anyone explain what just happened to me?
I had a pretty rough week. I just kept making mistakes everywhere i went and I no longer feel like talking to people helps since i feel like i am only bothering them with my problems... Which... Yeah its probably true, they all have their own bag of troubles that they need to sort trough and i don need to add to that pile. Anyway the reason i brought this up is that today, after i came home from an part time job i kind of... Broke down. All i could see in my mind where those stupid mistakes and people that i offended made angry or annoyed by them. I couldnt shut that voice up and it was the only thing that i could focus on no matter how hard i tried to focus on something else i couldnt. It was horrible. At the and i remembered that my parents gave me homeopatic medicine that i sometimes used to make my stress level drop a little. Now i am sitting here scared that it will happen again. I had similar problems before. I am an emotional crybaby that cant handle stres or anger withnout crying but it was never this strong ... What the heck is happening to me??
