Serious question: what do you say before reducing contact/going longer periods between contact (for your own boundaries) so you don’t unintentionally make the other person feel like you’re giving them the silent treatment with no explanation?
I know some people might say you don’t owe that person any explanation, and I get that. But fundamentally I personally can’t stomach the idea of making someone feel for a single minute the agony of the silent treatment. I ALSO want to train the seeds of that behavior pattern out of my brain’s neural pathways, because it would be really easy for my avoidance and dissociation tendencies to shift into passive aggressive silent treatments after arguments and such.

So, to anyone who has already navigated going lower contact and/or establishing boundaries with really enmeshed parents and stuff, what are ways I could send a short but compassionate message that 1) can’t be reframed in any way to turn others against me bc it’s too honestly neutral/kind and 2) lets the other person know in clear language that I will not be contacting them as much or responding as readily but am not just cutting them out of my life?

This is mostly aimed at my mom, if that helps. She’s got a lot of problem behaviors but I love her and am not ready to go no contact, if I ever will be. I WANT her to change and I want to give her enough chance to do that. She’s never had much change until the past couple years to do any emotional growth and I’m not giving up on her yet when she’s been able to change her behavior some already with enough prodding and me presenting alternatives or new information.

Any advice? I wouldn’t wish the silent treatment on my worst enemy and since I know how objectively bad it is, I do have a responsibility as a mature human adult to never put anyone through it, even just through accidental carelessness. 

Boy is it a ride teaching yourself patience and self-control!
