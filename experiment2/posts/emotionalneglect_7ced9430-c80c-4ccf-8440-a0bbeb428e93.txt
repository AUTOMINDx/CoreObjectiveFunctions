I am just so sad and angry.
I want to stop feeling like this I know I have to feel my emotions (something I was guilty of not doing in the past) but I hate it I hate feeling like this I really miss feeling apathetic. I know that I yes better for me to try and engage with these feelings but I’m so sad and angry and it feels like no one ever loved or cared enough to protect me. My sister told me a few months ago that she used to worry when she left me and my brother alone that he’d kill me (we fought a lot and I never wanted to hurt him) and my mom when I told her about how often we fought said “I’m so sorry that I didn’t know” but she did know she heard us and sometimes would send us to our rooms and she said it like we were accusing her snd whenever we bring up stuff she did she says shit like “I’m sorry I’m an inept mother”. She used to force me to tell her I loved her because she thought I a 12 year old child didn’t like her I’m just so sick of feeling responsible and being a mediator between my family. I want to feel “normal”.
