Parents purposely put me in situations where I would fail or be forced to make the “wrong”decision
They did it so they’d have an “excuse” to punish me. It’s hard for me to grasp how it’s possible to do this to a child that is still learning and growing. It’s hard to accept that you were a victim but my biggest lesson is we are never at fault and children should never be made to bear the burden of their parent’s trauma. 

- multiple times I did something like fold a towel wrong and was grounded for a full month 
- one time I was kicked out of the house (AS A MINOR) for getting a ride home with my cousin and her mom. Her mom stopped at the mall and I was “late”. My mom went as far as to bring emancipation paperwork home because apparently I didn’t want to be part of the family (this makes me laugh now cause if I were in a better place to sign it I would lol).  I ended up going to my friends family but didn’t realize until later that they were also narcissists. I could write an entire novel about how my mom utilized triangulation! 
- my mom would scream bloody murder at me getting anything lower than an A. Wouldn’t give two shits if my middle brother failed because he was her favorite - at least until the youngest was born. 

My parents were really upset we didn’t make the same mistakes they did. But their mistakes didn’t exist either so we won’t bring that up 🙊
