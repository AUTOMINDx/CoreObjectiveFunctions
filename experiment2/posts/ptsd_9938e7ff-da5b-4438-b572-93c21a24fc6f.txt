Looking back, I feel like I had warning signs
PTSD builds over time, it seems. I remember in school we read “Slaughterhouse 5”. We all laughed at some of the funny phrasing. But as an adult the phrase “unstuck in time” completely haunts me because I finally understand what it means.

About ten years ago I was coming home from work and a guy through himself in front of the train. I went home and stared at the ceiling. It’s the first time I remember feeling a separation from my body. 10+ years later I still see the conductor’s face sometimes when I am on that same platform.

In school my professor had his VA friends talk to us. One guy who fought in Vietnam made a lot of eye contact with me while talking about PTSD. In hindsight I feel like it was some sort of sign from the future.

A year or two later I was at work and a bomb went off. After that I was disconnected from my body for a long time.
