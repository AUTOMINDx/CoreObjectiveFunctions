Do you think there will never be another war?
I see this theme a lot with liberals. I would even go as far to say it’s the majority of liberals but that would be an anecdote. However, the idea of “we put too much money into the military, we should spend less on the military and more on the poor” is VERY common among the left leaning. It seems to neglect the reality of the world we live in where our Allies don’t spend  [enough](https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/14636/defense-expenditures-of-nato-countries/) (with some exceptions) and our enemies are increasing their military [spending.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/043015/us-vs-china-military-budget.asp) especially when purchasing power parity is taken into account they are actually pretty close to us. 

I am not talking about a Vietnam or an Afghanistan where it’s a superpower getting involved with some little country. I’m talking about a major conflict on the scale of The Great War or WW2.

So how can the US justify cutting its military budget when many of our allies don’t meet spending agreements, our enemies spend close to what we do and are increasing their spending (without having to spend much of anything defending other countries), and our enemies are openly threatening Taiwan and Ukraine (and others) on a daily basis?

TLDR: will there never be another war? And if there will be a war, how can you justify cutting our military spending given the spending and activity of our allies and enemies?

Edit: China and Russia are just the examples I came up with. Could be anyone. The future is a long time, anything could happen. China was a backwater 30 years ago and is now the number 2 of the world.
