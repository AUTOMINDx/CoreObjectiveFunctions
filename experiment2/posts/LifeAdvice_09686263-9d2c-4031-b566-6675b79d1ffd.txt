Emotionally/mentally torn
I’m not sure where to go with this and it maybe more venting than anything for me. Im genuinely torn with trying to maintain my current relationship, wanting to move on from her and get with a friend who I’ve suppressed feelings for years, and literally just packing my shit and disappearing int the wood. 

Some details. So with my current relationship we get along quite well and majority of the time I enjoy spending time with her. However she’s an extremely anxious/clingy person (with maybe a hint of bipolar but not positive). I feel like a lot of times I have to tread very lightly and always say the proper things. For example if I don’t call her babe sometimes she’ll pretty much stop and tell me to say it. A lot of times she gets upset if something doesn’t go quite her way. Like if she wants to do something but I have personal stuff I need to take care of. Also if we’re at a party together she like has to be touching me in some way and she won’t go be with her friends if they’re there. 

The friend. I’ve literally known this girl my entire life. We have baby pictures together and things like that. I feel that I have more in common with her than my current relationship. We have a lot of the same friends as well. So I realized that I had feelings for her probably around 12 so arguably first crush. I chose to suppress them and not bring them up to her because we have so many connections and that I’d hate to make things awkward or uncomfortable for her. I kind of assumed that she wouldn’t/isn’t interested in me anyway. I probably just need to move on but every time I see it just opens those feelings back up. 

All of this and yet part me would rather just get away from everything and live in the woods by myself until I die. It would probably be easiest overall. I wouldn’t feel trapped by my feelings and relationships.
