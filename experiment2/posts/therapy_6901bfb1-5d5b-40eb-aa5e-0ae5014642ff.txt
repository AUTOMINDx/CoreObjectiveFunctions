What kind of therapy should I pursue
So I can't seem to find anything anywhere else online for this topic, and have very little knowledge of the different therapies, so I thought I may be able to find options here. So here's the big issue, I know I'm being abusive to my boyfriend with some of my actions, but I can't seem to find ways to get better with the things I'm doing. I was wondering what type of therapy would work best. One part of me feels like relationship therapy would work better as it only occurs in the relationship, but another part of me feels like personal therapy would be better cause it is me doing it. I don't know which one to pursue and was hoping I could get some insight. Thanks in advance.
