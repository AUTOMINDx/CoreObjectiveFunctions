Off of work for years as a stay at home mom... How do I start over?
I left my partner due to abuse a few days ago after being s stay at home mom for a few years at his request. I am literally homeless with kids and don't know where to begin. I went to an open interview for fast food today but they basically told me I was overly experienced and would leave for a different or better service industry job. I've looked on all fb groups for my area and can't find hiring besides scammers. I bartended for 16 years, which isn't feasible with two young kids and no family nearby. That's not gonna make a great resume obviously. How do I make myself desirable to an employer with a somewhat tight schedule and being off for several years? How do you dive back in?
