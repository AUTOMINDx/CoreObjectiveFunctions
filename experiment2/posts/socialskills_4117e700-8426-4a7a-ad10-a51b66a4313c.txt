Speech problems
Sometimes i feel like i'm a toddler learning how to talk its hard to explain but its like whenever i have to talk its like freestyle rapping. I didn't have so much trouble with it before i took antipsychotic meds. Ofc i had difficulties talking but after i took them i just woke up one day forgetting every conversation i had and having to start all over again. My head just gets empty whenever i have to reply so i just say nothing. I really wanna talk like everyone else so i can meet new ppl and have a normal conversation but its so hard. Other ppl think i'm talking just fine but they don't know how much i'm struggling to come up with something. Sometimes i have days where i'm more social tho but its rare. I've been thinking about reading so i can improve it but i can't focus and have no attention span. Will it get better if i keep reading or is it just a lost cause? Is there any other way how to improve it? I often watch movies and write conversations down so i can look at them when i play dnd but when i have a real life con, i obv can't look at it. I also have problems with daydreaming ever since the meds so i think it has something to do with your creativity that just gets less active but maybe i'm wrong
