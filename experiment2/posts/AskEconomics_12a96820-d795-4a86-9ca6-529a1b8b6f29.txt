Book on International Financial Institutions
I'm looking for a book targeted at the lay person which explains the various international financial organizations and their role in a simple way. I want to understand what the IMF does or what the WB does, what's the point of G20 and G7 and what does WTO do... it's all very confusing in my head right now.

I really enjoyed reading David Moss's 'A Concise Guide to Macroeconomics' before and I'd love if there's a similarly styled book for this stuff.

Thanks!
