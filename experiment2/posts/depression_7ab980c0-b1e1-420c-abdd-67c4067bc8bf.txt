Sad but true…
It secretly terrifies me that I have no solid personality or identity. If you asked me who I am, I could only give you my name and age. My identity is fragmented and prone to shattering under pressure. I have no idea who I am, but I know each of my created personalities very well, it’s like being 50 people all at once and nobody at all at the same time. I’m an empty body with a mind that’s overflowing.
