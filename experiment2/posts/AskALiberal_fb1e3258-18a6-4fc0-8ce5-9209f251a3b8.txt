Repulsive Republican Characteristics
What are the most repulsive characteristics of modern day conservatives/Republicans/Trumpists - you know, the people who troll subs like this and think they’re asking smaat questions :) I’ll start:

They don’t really give a flying F what Christ has to say.  I know - let’s rip children from their mothers arms and cage them while their desperate families eat shit - get it on camera, more fun for the GOP!

#2?
