Do you also hate being touched by your Nparent/s?
For reference, touch is one of my most prominent love languages. But I’m also aware that I have anger issues. Lately I have become more aware that as much as I love touch, I hate when my Nparent touch’s me or even just gets too close. I feel suffocated, rage and anxiety all at once. Just wondering if anyone has a similar experience.
