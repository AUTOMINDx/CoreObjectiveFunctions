AITA (f23) for getting angry at my partner (m26) for eating MY groceries?
I do not give permission for anyone to use my post. I’m on mobile, so sorry for formatting.

I promise the title isn’t as bad at it sounds. I have several food allergies that I recently found about over the last two years. In that time period I’ve completely switched out my diet. I’ve been buying my separate groceries that are a lot more expensive than normal chips, bread, milk etc. I still buy all the normal groceries that he likes as he’s not a fan of “vegan” options.  I cook everything for him too and with ingredients he likes, even if I can’t eat it. 

He constantly ends up demolishing my allergy free snacks within days of me purchasing them claiming they’ll go bad. I’ve asked him repeatedly not to and I just got home to find he’s used all of my creamer for my coffee. He buys Doritos and ramen and foods I can’t eat and then eats my more expensive food. He always apologizes and says he “forgot” or that “ it was going to expire soon” when the expiration date isn’t for months. 

I got angry and texted him again asking gently why he kept eating my food instead and that I was disappointed. He said he forgot and that it wasn’t a big deal. I texted back telling him it was bullshit and that I’ve been “reminding” him for the last year and I can’t help if he’s too cheap to help buy groceries I can eat too when I buy them for him. He said I was being unreasonable and that it’s just food. 


(For context he is incredibly cheap and makes a lot more money than I do. Which isn’t a big deal. I just think I’m justified in being angry)
