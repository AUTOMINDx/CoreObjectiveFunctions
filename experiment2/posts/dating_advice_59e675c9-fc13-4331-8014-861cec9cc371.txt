High stress partner struggles with my laid back attitude in crises
Hey yall, crowd scouring here because I'd like to learn to be a better partner for my lovely wife. 

She really struggles in medium to high stress situations, she gets herself in a flap and can't get out, all the things I have tried so far do not help. Situations like driving in the snow, or anything with a deadline, or anything where she might be 'told off' make her very agitated. She also tends to shoot down solutions in this state, which is very frustrating. 

Things I've tried:
*Solutions to the problem*: shoots down every solution as they come, with tiny details that fundamentally don't matter. Massively exaggerates the potential consequences.
*What's the worst that could happen?*: Massively fixates in the negative possibilities, inflates all potential damage.
*Asking her to reflect that she's overreacting*: this normally works after the fact, but never works in the moment. 

My wife is a godsend and if I just have to live with this then that's ok, I would just appreciate suggestions on how I can better handle this in the moment. I'm very much a, pick the best option available and get on with it kind of guy, even if that option isn't great, and I'm really struggling to be empathetic in this situation. I strongly suspect that I am doing more harm than good at the moment.  

I think the core of it is that the concequences in her head are always so much worse than reality, it reminds me of a mini panic attack. What should I be doing to help more?
