Am I always wrong?
My live in significant other always makes my forgetting a detail of a conversation that occurred days or even weeks ago like it’s a personal attack on her. She frequently says that by her having to tell me again, or my forgetting, is me being intentionally disrespectful. She expects me to write down every thing she says to do, yet if I do it during the conversation she claims that is disrespecting her as well. I don’t know what to do. 

She’s been grieving her mother’s passing for a few weeks now and are supposed to go to SoCal this weekend for her mother’s memorial. After the fight today she has told me that I’m an embarrassment and that she doesn’t want me to go. 

She bought a house last month which has added to her stress, yet she does little to nothing to help with the unpacking. Instead she dictates to her son and I what she expects us to do.

I’m reacting through my trauma but she’s “sick of my bull shit excuses” and I don’t know what else to do. I’m financially dependent on her for a few more months as I’m starting a new job Monday. 

How can I learn to meet her expectations and keep my cool as I have been told by multiple people that this is all my own fault.
