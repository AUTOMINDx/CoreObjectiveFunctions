Should I major in cs or be self taught with help of an online course??
Hi everyone!

I (24yrs old) am thinking of going back to school to get my second bachelors degree. My first was in political science snd business. I know it’s a dumb thought to get a second bachelors but computer science really interests me. 

The university I would get my degree from would be 100% online and from a small university in my home state of New Mexico. My career goal is to be a mobile app or web app developer.

I guess my main question is: Will getting a bachelors in CS actually increase my job prospects or am I better off just doing an online course in Web development ( not talking about a boot camp). 

I’m currently taking launch schools course on web development with a focus  on Ruby, I’ve been doing It for about 2 months and I must say I love the course structure and even all the pre requisites before youre even allowed to take the actual Launch School course. 


The price difference between going to college and Launch school is quite significant too. I’m looking at about 16,000$ in total (price if I dont get any scholarships) and about 1,200$ give or take for launch school (if I take around 6 months in finishing the courses).

Which path will benefit me more??

Just for reference here is the Uni I’m interested in studying at. Oh and I forgot to mention; since I already got my first bachelors this program will only take be two years of consecutive full time semesters to accomplish.

Thanks so much!
