Neuropsychological evaluation at 8-10pm on a Friday night
I finally this year managed to get the healthcare system to realise I needed a neuropsychological evaluation after receiving a permanent brain injury after a car accident in 2013. 

As I'm currently on disability and unable to work full time, I wasn't satisfied waiting for my public healthcare appointment which was scheduled for March 2022, since my job is considering firing me for not being able to work full time, so my GP referred me to a private clinic. 

I had my appointment this week, started with lots of tests on Thursday afternoon, and then they asked me to return for more tests and the talking evaluation (which is meant to be the first thing they do, but because they're understaffed due to illness, it became the last thing)... At 8pm on Friday night. I feel now kind of scammed, cause I paid Â£150 to go private after years of struggle, so I could hopefully return to work sooner. But now I feel like I can't trust the result - because who is at their best mentally at 8pm on Friday night??

The neuropsychologist also very abruptly ended our conversation at 9.59pm saying "they lock the door to the building at 10pm, so if you rush you can make it" - but is not planning on continuing the conversation from what I understand. How can this evaluation be accurate, when it's this rushed and shoddy? 

I'm glad I kept my original appointment with the public hospital now, where it states it will take 2-3 DAYS, as I have serious doubts about the quality of this guy's work... and angry that I spent the money to go private. Usually I've found private means better care, but this was definitely not the case here and I'm just so frustrated to have not had doctors take my brain injury seriously for so many years despite my pain and cognitive issues, and then the neuropsychologist pulls this crap on me.  Ugh.
