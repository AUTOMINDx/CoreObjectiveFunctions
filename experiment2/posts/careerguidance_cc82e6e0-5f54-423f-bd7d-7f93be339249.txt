Is it normal for companies to hold interviews even though they've "chosen" their candidate already?
Edit: apparently I was worried for nothing, I just got the job offer ten minutes ago! 

I had an internal interview last week for a different department at the hospital network I work at. They seemed to really like me and the hiring manager basically said "yeah you seem like a really good fit!" 

The weird thing was that I had technically applied go this position but in a different wing in the department. I think what had happened was that when they posted the job, they did it to the wrong wing, so HR had left me a voice-mail saying that I actually need to send an application to the one that they updated that day. He also said in this voice-mail that I once again, hiring manager has me set as a candidate, so I was pretty stoked and sent the application to the correct posting. 

I emailed the manager this afternoon because I wasn't sure what the next steps were, since I never had an internal transfer before. She replied that she was conducting a few more interviews this week and "after that, we'll make our decision." 

Now I'm freaking out, because I don't know if that means they found more qualified candidates that I'm now competing with, or if it's some sort of formality that I'm too ignorant to know that exists with internal hiring. I REALLY want this job, but now I'm scared I might not get it. Am I overreacting and this kind of thing is common, or are my fears justified?
