Is it bad or weird that I'm obsessed with my girlfriends feet?
I constantly want to give her foot massages and really love it when she walks around barefoot with no shoes or socks on.

It is getting colder now so I crank up the heat so she is comfortable walking around barefoot. 

I want to paint her toes and buy her sexy open toed shoes.

I worry that I am getting carried away as she teases me about being a foot guy sometimes.

I want to take another job so I can afford to buy her more sandals so she can model them.
