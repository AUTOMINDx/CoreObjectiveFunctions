In War and Peace, the Freemasons are "displeased" with "perceived illuminism" of one of their peers. Why would they be displeased? Weren't Freemasons also into similar ideas?
This is in book 2, part 3, chapter 7:

&gt;This speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in the Lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs of Illuminism, met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre.

Why would they react this way?
