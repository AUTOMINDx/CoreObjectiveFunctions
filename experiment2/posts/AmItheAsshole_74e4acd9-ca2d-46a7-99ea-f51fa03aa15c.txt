AITA for demanding my girlfriend to pay to get the toilet fixed?
I (23) have been with my girlfriend (21)for over a year and she moved in with me a couple of months ago. I started having problems with toilet eversince and I end up paying to get it fixed. I always tell her "please can you not flush fiminine hygiene products down?" And she be like "yea, no problem".


Yesterday I got back to the apartment and found the toilet damaged as if someone flushed down something and got it stuck. I figure she flushed down her tampons so I yell at her asking what the eff did I say about flushing fiminine hygience products down. She acts confused and I point out that I was referring to her tempons but then she goes "oh I thought you meant plastic stuff like a empty soup bottle". I then tell her she needs to pay to get it fixed this time because I was done paying for unnecessary expense but she objects and says she won't pay and that I was ridiculous to make this her responsibility and I argued with her that she shouldn't have flushed down tampons and got the toilet stuck so she has to pay for it but she says it's my place so I automatically should handle fixing anything in it but I tell her her logic is bull and this is the result of her actions wether she knew it and wanted to admit it or not. She gives me some nasty looks claiming I'm treating her like shit then calls me an idiot and walks out and stops speaking to me.

I decided to leave the toilet as it is until she pays to get it fixed but she keeps calling my behavior abusive and controlling and petty.

AITA?
