Half of my family in shambles
I have never imagined I would be here and I am feeling really depressed about it. For context I graduated college in November of which the whole 4 years were on my own until the last year which happened during COVID so I lived at my Dad’s house. Parents are divorced.

My mom is the kind of person to feed on drama. She loves stirring stuff and guilt tripping to get what she wants, and the older I get the more I understand and see it. Over the past 2 years I have been getting random texts from her saying she is losing sleep because I don’t love her or that I never go see her, that sort of stuff out of nowhere. In every situation I’m guilted while she is the victim and it has been hard to deal with, and my responses has gone from saying sorry and explaining myself to gradually getting to the point where I just get really mad at her. Under my Dad’s advice this last time I was civil and explained that until she can treat me as an adult we won’t have the conversation anymore, which I never got a reply.

Today just a couple of hours ago I got an email from her completely blaming me for every problem in the family and that my grandparents from her side have removed me from their will, which I never had any issues with my grandparents ever so that really made me feel horrible, it blind sided me to say the least. I’ve never been really depressed before but fuck, it is setting in really fucking hard and I don’t know what to do.

My question I guess is this; what in the hell do I do? Do I mend and say all is forgiven and try to continue this thing I have been dealing with the past couple of years or just stop trying and forget about it? She has frustrated me to the point where I don’t want my kids to ever know her and I don’t want to even show up for holidays anymore.
