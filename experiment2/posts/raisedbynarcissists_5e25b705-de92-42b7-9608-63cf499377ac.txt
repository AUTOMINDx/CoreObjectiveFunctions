Pregnancy announcement sparks explosion
Hi all. I'm new here and on mobile. Please be patient. I've enjoyed reading the posts/responses here, helps to know there are other people dealing with these things as well. 
My husband and I have been LC with my family since my grandmother (Nmom's mom) passed a year ago. She was the matriarch of our family and mitigated a lot of the damage my Nmom tried to inflict. Since she passed Nmom has gone off the rails and we've had to step away for our sanity. I miss my grandfather terribly, but my whole family lives on the same property so it's hard to see him without Nmom or her monkeys being around. 
We announced on the book of faces yesterday, that we are expecting our first child. Lots of excitement from friends and his family, but a complete melt down ensued from my Nmom. She was "devastated" and "sobbing her eyes out" because we didn't single her out for a special notification. She reached out to me for the first time in a year to tell me I've caused her "the worst pain of her life" and when I didn't respond last night sent me another message demanding to know "what I've done to make you hate me this much!" I finally did respond and simply told her this is because of her actions towards me and my husband and if she wants to be a part of my child's life she'll do better. If not, I have no problem cutting her off completely. 
Does anyone else deal with the constant melt downs over their good news? Or the attempts to seize control with a tantrum? How would you all handle this? I'm waiting for the monkeys to get on my case, it always happens.
