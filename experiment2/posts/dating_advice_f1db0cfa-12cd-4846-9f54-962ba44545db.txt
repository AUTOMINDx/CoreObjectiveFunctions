[Update] I asked her out!

So, I [18m] asked her [18f] out over text yesterday as I am unable to see her until after Thanksgiving break. I asked her if she is down to go on a date after the break and she said she is "totally down". We've talked a bit over this Thanksgiving break and we are tentatively planning to go to a museum or something.

Only problem is that she is a really slow texter. Should I be worried? She told me that she has a fuckton of stuff due this week and has had to work 12 hour days and stuff, and she has generally been a slow texter since I met her.

I am thinking of escalating things on the next date, but am unsure how the logistics/setting things up for that work. 

What should I do? And how should I ensure I get a chance to go for a kiss? And even more, how do I know if she likes me? (Besides her agreeing to a date and generally seeming into me)

Thanks.

Tl;dr: asked her out, unsure how to proceed
