Anxiety over death
I know a little about what other people have anxiety over but lately I’ve had such a huge amount of anxiety over death. And in my group therapy no one ever seems to mention it. I do not take medication yet but also thinking maybe I should try give it a try. I don’t like the idea because I always have the weird and rare side effects. 

I have a lot of stress from a relationship and work. But I have the worst anxiety about death of my loved ones, myself, and my pets. The second someone says they don’t feel good I start imagining what could happen. When my cat won’t eat, I suddenly imagine what progresses from that. In life I’m generally a fairly happy person. But this anxiety is so overwhelming. Not only am I triggered by the talking about/someone being sick, but sometimes, when I’m showering often, my mind wanders, and suddenly I’m watching/imagining a death of someone I love. I don’t understand why my brain does that to me and I hate it. My chest feels tight and I feel like I can’t breathe for a small matter of time. It’s just awful. 
I do have a therapist. And she’s helped me recognize and interrupt these thoughts and helped me try to destress but it doesn’t feel like enough. It still happens and I feel horrible too often. I can usually interrupt the thought and focus on something else but I don’t even want the thought to begin with. 

Anyone who knows how I feel, I’d love to hear I’m not alone. Anyone with advice I’m all ears. 

P.s. - I don’t normally drink or do any drugs. I did used to self medicate with THC and while it usually super helped the anxiety it super didn’t help my diet.
