Letter of Recommendation Request Conventions
Application season is upon us, so please pardon yet another application-related question.

My applications are due starting Jan 2nd for MA programs. I asked professors on Mon, Nov 22nd if they would be willing to write letters for me. Since I've been out of school for a while, I contacted them by email and included a bit of info to refresh their memories. 

One responded with a 'yes' within 2 hours, and the other two did not reply. I am wondering if/when I follow up? I know Thanksgiving probably created a huge backlog of emails and professors are busy as it is. 

On the other hand, if these professors feel too much time has passed or don't remember me well, I have to ask someone else. We're getting to the point where it may be too close to the deadline to ask others. I wake up with anxiety daily and check my email to start the day off disappointed.  It's hard to focus on a SOP and other materials if I may not be able to get the letters. 

I know generally people only ask those who would definitely write one, but as I've said, I've been out of school a few years and I didn't see myself going for a graduate degree when I was still in undergrad. 

Thank you in advance for any advice.
