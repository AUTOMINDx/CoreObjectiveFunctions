I love staying up late even though I’m dead tired, it’s like I’m actively sabotaging my own life
I’m literally *exhausted* mentally, can’t think straight, can’t focus, been this way for awhile now. Actually went and worked out today with my sports club, absolutely drained and know I’ll 100% feel it in the morning. But yet I stay up late, and I know I should get sleep, but the worst part in the day is waking up, and staying up late almost feels like a way to delay it, though it only ever feels good in the moment. 

I’ll never learn, and I’ll never change, since the only time I ever can feel anything is at night anyway.
