How should I deal with a coworker making me look bad in front of the rest of the team for an arguably simple mistake I made?
So, to give a little bit of context, I got a job at a restaurant a few months back, and recently me and some coworkers went out to grab a beer after work. Mind you, I am not the most outgoing person but I still went because I want to have good relationships with the people I spend so many hours with every week. 
While we were casually chatting with each other jokingly talking about what we don't like that other people in different posts do, this guy ( let's call him Jack) becomes visibly angry and starts complaining about how some of us waiters don't greet tables quick enough and he has to wait. This went on for a couple minutes with him flailing his hands about and raising his voice.
He was clearly referring to a situation earlier that day, where I did not greet a table.I know for a fact he was referring to me. That table was in my section and he even said which one it was. I should say this was by accident, since I simply didn't notice them. My name was never mentioned but I get the feeling that he was talking about this earlier when I wasn't there.
In the moment, I felt ashamed and was honestly taken aback quite a bit and I didn't say anything even though I feel like I should speak up. He made me look bad and that is something I really don't appreciate, especially with all the hard work that I truly put in. I don't know if I should talk to him privately and try to calmly find a middle ground or just let this die out. I definitely do not want to make a fuss out of this and create drama. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any advice you might give me.
