Going from 2 sessions per week to 1
Anybody out there also done this jump? How was it? Was it difficult to adjust to? 

T and I have been entertaining the idea of dropping to 1 session a week whilst also preparing for our 3 week Christmas break. I'm in a much better place recently but my plan was that I'd stick to 2 a week following the break and then drop down. But today she suggested 1 a week following the break, which I felt a bit unsure of and brought up some old abandonment wounds - "she's too busy for me/she doesn't want me to see me" ect ect. 

However I do feel like it might be a good idea to try. And I'm trying to remind myself life is in a much better place these days so it might not be the crisis I'm envisaging.

Any thoughts?
