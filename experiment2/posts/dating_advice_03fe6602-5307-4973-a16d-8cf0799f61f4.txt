Determining whether I [m] am in the friend zone
So my colleague and I have grown close over the past year. We have spent time outside of work together, mainly going on walks and chatting. I am struggling to work out if she is interested in me romantically or just on a friendship level. 

I am probably missing a lot of signs either way, being honest, Im a bit clueless about such things.I know she is single and uses dating apps. There are times when I'm convinced she is quite keen then I won't hear from her for ages. 

I can't seem to think of any subtle way of finding out rather than just asking directly. I don't particularly want to do that, even if I did Im not sure how I could fit it naturally into messaging/conversation. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to go about determining either way about how she sees me? Thanks!

We are both mid to late 20s if that matters at all.
