God's will as randomness
God is considered by the theists as an explanation for, for example, abiogenesis, 'fine tuning', etc. But why would it be a better explanation than regular randomness? Randomness is unpredictability. It exists in one's mind. Someone's will is as random to me as stellar evolution or hurricanes. Claiming that God's will is different from that is special pleading.
