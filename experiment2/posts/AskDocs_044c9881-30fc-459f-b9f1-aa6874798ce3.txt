Extreme Thirst
I am 30F and have suffered from extreme thirst for about 6 years. I measured a sample day and it was 2.1 gallons of liquids (combined water and coffee — 1.6 gallons of this was water). I always have normal blood tests for pretty much everything. I have been consuming extreme amounts of water for 6 years and I’m very worried that one day I will get water intoxication. I have tested normal for Diabetes Insipidus, A1C, TSH, and a CBC panel. I thought perhaps I have dry mouth from Sjögren’s syndrome but I got a lip biopsy and was negative for this too. I take a bunch of medications, so maybe one of them is drying out my mouth? I started cevimeline for dry mouth hoping it would help but I don’t see a change. If it helps, my current diagnoses include: rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, allergies, vocal cord dysfunction, acid reflux. In addition to fears of water intoxication, it’s a huge burden to constantly need a bathroom wherever I go.

EDIT: current meds are methotrexate, Orencia, inhalers for asthma, desvenlafaxine, buspirone, singulair, fexofenadine, vitamin D supplement, cevimeline, esomeprazole
