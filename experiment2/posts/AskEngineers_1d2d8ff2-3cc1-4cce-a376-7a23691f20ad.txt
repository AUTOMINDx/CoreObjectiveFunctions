Are man or vehicle-portable coilguns/combustion light-gas guns/scram cannons a viable alternative to firearms?
I'm a hard sci-fi writer looking for advanced weapons for aliens to provide various human groups in a proxy war. So far, coilguns seem the most probable, as man-portable versions have already been built, but they're not exactly fit for combat. Preferably, the weapons would have some sort of edge over normal firearms; otherwise there'd be no reason to use them.
