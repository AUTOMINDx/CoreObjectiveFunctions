How do you endure a shitty job until the next one?
Can't go into too much detail but I am working at a small startup.

Pay is ok  ( Not really because I do both design and web development ), work life balance is good, but jesus I can't stand working with my boss...

I get a lot of anxiety even doing the tasks I love because of the friction. I'm starting to look for a different place but the anxiety of staying is actually crushing me.

Added with the fact that I also need to work on my portfolio really overwhelms me.

**How would you endure stinky interpersonal relationships at work? at least for the time being because I am losing motivation everyday ( it wasn't always like this ).**
