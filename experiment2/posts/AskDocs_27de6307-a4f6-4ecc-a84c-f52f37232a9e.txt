43/male/white/275lbs/5'10"/Canada -- valsalva maneuver temporarily gives me much better hearing.
So, the obvious diagnosis is 'too much wax' but I use ear drops regularly (the carbamide peroxide kind that fizz to attempt to loosen wax), a water-filled bulb lavage, and I never stick qtips down there because I don't want to perforate my ear drum.

If I do a valsalva maneuver for like the next minute my hearing is magnitudes better. Like, the volume I had the tv on is loud enough to hurt!

Am I doing something wrong with my ear maintenance? I have a lot of skin problems and there's always a layer of dried skin on the surface of my ear that I'm cleaning off.
