Future In-Law Problems
My fiancé (24M) and I (22F) have been together for almost 4 years now. We have a great relationship, and everyone around us supports us getting married - except his mom and stepdad. To be honest, they haven’t supported our relationship since we first started dating. They have pulled him aside and said things that summed up to them describing me as a whore and not a good enough woman for him to be with. They also lectured us for moving in together and being “intimate” before marriage on multiple occasions. It’s a constant battle to ignore them disregard and disrespect our entire relationship. His stepdad has even threatened to “get ugly” with me because I didn’t great the stepdad’s parents like the king and queen of England. He has said horrible things about my mother’s parenting skills, and threatened one of our groomsmen if we found out he said that we shouldn’t get married at all (at our engagement party). 

However, the thing that they don’t know is, is that I know all of their dirty laundry. I am even the sole reason my fiancé even has a relationship with them currently. 

Now, with all of this being said, I don’t want to come in between my fiancé and his family - I never have. I have never argued with them and tried to get along with them continuously for the past four years. It has come to a point, though, where I don’t want to damage my mental health anymore than it already has. I honestly don’t want them in my life anymore or at the wedding, but I don’t want to force my fiancé to make a decision like that. Is there any advice anyone could give me to keep my sanity without destroying any relationships?
