My husband (M32) compares him smoking weed to my (F30) ADHD medication.
My husband (M32) smokes weed recreationally, and I (F30)take medication for ADHD(was diagnosed as a teenager, and my medication is prescribed by my doctor) and whenever I get on him for smoking, he brings up that I’m on ADHD medication, which is also a drug, so that’s the same thing as him smoking weed, which I believe is comparing apples to oranges. This “debate” has led to many arguments between us.  I’ve thought many times about asking my doctor but am afraid since weed is still illegal in my state. Thank you in advance!
