How did Ariel Castro go on to have those girls kidnapped for 12 years straight?!?!
It never seems to get to me… the situation makes no sense what’s so ever. Castro lived in a crappy house, a small one at that. He had 3 women in his home, who he wouldn’t drug when guests came if I’m not mistaken? Regardless though, he would have tons of guests over all the time including his own family, and on top of that his neighbors are right next to him as well. 






It just makes no sense to me how this could’ve gone for 12 years. He didn’t have any elaborate plan what’s so ever, he would just put them in rooms or the basement and would even leave them by themselves. The house also isn’t sound proof, you can hear everything if you really listened I’m sure. They only got free because he forgot to lock the door one time, but they should’ve been free way before then. 






It also surprises me how no one put the cases together, I mean 3 young women missing in the same neighborhood, not even the same city. They could’ve realized “oh crap a serial killer in this neighborhood could be on the lose” and then go search.








Edit: NOT ONCE did I ever question the women themselves, rather the neighbors or guests Ariel would invite. Never in my post did I question them, and sorry if y’all took it the wrong way.
