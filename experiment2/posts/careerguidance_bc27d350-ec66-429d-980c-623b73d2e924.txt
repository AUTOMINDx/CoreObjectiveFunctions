Leaving a job after 2 weeks? Who knows!
I've been mechanical engineer for the last 8 years! I've finally left my the job where I initially trained.
A leap of faith has landed me in a job where the pay is better and I'm working a lot less hours!

I'm 2 weeks in and it's not at all what was promised or expected and to top it off it's a good 45 minutes drive away from home.  Am I being stupid looking for another job so soon? A company near my home is currently open to applications but how do I even explain myself? Leaving a job after 2 weeks is not a good look!
