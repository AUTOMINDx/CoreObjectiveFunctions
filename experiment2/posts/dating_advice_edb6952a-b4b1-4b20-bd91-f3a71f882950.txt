Is 2 months too soon?
So I have been seeing 24M for about a month and a half now, we were good friends for about 6 months prior to dating. Our friendship was fantastic and dating him has been fantastic too, we are pretty much inseparable already. I’m waiting for the gf question to be asked within the next couple of weeks but I don’t know if I’m expecting it too soon. Is 2 months too soon to start a committed relationship?
