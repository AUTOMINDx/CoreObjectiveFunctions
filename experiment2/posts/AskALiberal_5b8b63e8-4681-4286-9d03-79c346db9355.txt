Is it fair to say that January 6th moved Democrats to the right on law enforcement and criminal justice, and squashed any interest in “Defund the Police”?
Title says it all.

With the fact that half the Democratic Party is now convinced that the GOP is planning a coup attempt for 2025, and the rising public sentiment that we need law enforcement to protect people against right wing violence, is it fair to say that the insurrection moved the Democrats to the right on law enforcement, away from “Defund the Police” and back to police reform? 

Also, do you think the insurrection moved the Democrats towards wanting a more punitive criminal justice system, instead of a rehabilitative one?
