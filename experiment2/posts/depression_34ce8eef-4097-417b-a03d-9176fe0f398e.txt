Abandonment when in a crisis
I feel like whenever you open up to someone about your mental health issues people always say, I’m here if you ever need me. Then when you’re in a crisis, it’s radio silence or they are too busy. How do you cope with this? I feel a lot of abandonment from people I love to the extent I want to cut them out. When I share I’m struggling with my mental health and they don’t follow up or check in after it upsets me. It makes me feel like I’m burdening them with my problems and makes me feel alone in any future crisis I have. Does anyone else feel this way? I’m struggling and I feel alone.
