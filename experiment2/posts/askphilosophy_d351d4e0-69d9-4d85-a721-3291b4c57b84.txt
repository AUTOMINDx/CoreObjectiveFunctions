What are some nonfiction writings containing good, informed speculation on the future development of ideologies and mentalities?
I recently read _Homo Deus_ by Yuval Noah Harari, which contains a number of speculations about the future. Harari says that the ideology (or "religion") of _liberal humanism_ has been extremely influential these last several decades. He posits that science and technology will make it increasingly clear how deterministic and manipulable human beings are, and he speculates that this (among other factors) will cause liberal humanism to give way to new ideologies and views of the human mind. He suspects, as far as I remember, that people will lose faith in the individual and the idea of free will which in turn will cause _democracy_ to lose much of his appeal.

Notably, Harari is talking not about future philosophers and elites but about the _prevailing mindsets of the general population_.

The point of this thread is not to discuss whether Harari's particular predictions are correct, nor whether my understanding of him is correct. My point is that I really appreciate that Harari engages in this kind of speculation at all, because it is something I seldom see. 

It seems to me that when people try to predict the future, they tend to assume that every ideology that will ever exist has already been invented and that all that's left is a zero-sum struggle where certain ideologies gain ground (eg "atheism becomes dominant" or "Islam becomes dominant").

I am interested in other nonfictional works that speculate, with good argumentation, how the beliefs and mindsets of the general population might evolve over the next several decades and centuries, in tandem with the march of technology.

I'm not sure whether this "counts" as a philosophy question. Let's see whether the mods will nix it.

Anyway, thanks in advance! ðŸ™‚
