Talk Therapy Triggering?
I was recently diagnosed with PTSD due to childhood trauma. I had never received therapy nor talked about the abuse before. I’ve been coping by ignoring that it had ever happened. I almost feel like talk therapy is re-traumatizing, and I experienced increased irritability and hyper vigilance after my first two sessions. Is this normal, or do I need a different therapist? Or a different approach to treatment? Does it get easier to talk about trauma? Thank you for any insight you’re willing to share.
