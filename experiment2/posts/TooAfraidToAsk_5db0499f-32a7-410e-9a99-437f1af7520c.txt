Do a lot of people who work from home actually work only 60-70% of working hours?
Or is just me? Donâ€™t get me wrong, I know I am a procrastinator. I am not the best worker, but I get the job done. And yes, if I think I can do all the important and urgent tasks in 3-4 hours, I am gonna spend the rest of the day not working. But I am wondering if it really is just me? All my coworkers act like they work every minute of the working hours, but that just seems too unrealistic to me.
