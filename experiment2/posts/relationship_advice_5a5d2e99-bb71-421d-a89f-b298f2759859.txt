Wife Changed Her Mind About Wanting Kids But it Comes With a Price
So long story short I found out about 3 years ago that I have a blockage so I'm shooting blanks and if we wanted to have kids it would require semen extraction and IVF. We decided that that was not what we wanted and that was that. 

Another long story short. We moved about 5 years ago to the city that she grew up in. I am not a fan of living here. Never have been and honestly do not want to stay here any longer. I hate it here. We had agreed to move to another city we both agreed on in about 8 months once our lease is up. 

So, last week after leaving our friends house who have just had a baby she says that she wants to have a kid. Ask if I would want that and I do. I always have but went along with her because it would be expensive and difficult. 

The caveat is she said that we could not move if we have a child. She cried and said that she thought that I would take this as "her trying to manipulate the situation". I'm paraphrasing there. I told her if that's what it is we can move somewhere not in this area. 

I feel like I am being manipulated. My family is thousands of miles away. I barely see them. I do not like the place we live for a variety of reasons. I really have no friends here besides friends of hers. 

Thoughts?
