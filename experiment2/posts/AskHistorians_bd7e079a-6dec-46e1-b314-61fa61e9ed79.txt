Why the ancient Greeks lived in the hills?
I'm in Athens, in awe of the ruins and while I understand why one would want to keep the citadel like Acropolis high on the hill, I'm still puzzled about nearby districts like Plaka or Monastiraki. Like, who in their sane mind would think it's a good idea, the surface is so steep there, the sheer effort to build a house, provide it with water, food, sewage, etc. must be enormous at those times. As with most of the  things in live, there must be some sort of economical rationale behind that I'm not aware of. High ground in case of attack? Idk.

P.S. Aren't you afraid that cats will seize the power of this city one day? Was laughing my ass off, there are like 10 of these chonky behemoths per square meter, lol.
