Why can so many Americans afford to quit their jobs?
For context, I'm from Europe. I keep seeing these posts about people quitting their job in the US because of low wages, poor treatment etc. I fully support the fact that people are fighting for their rights and I really hope this sets a precedent in which employees will be treated better.

I just wonder about the following: If these same people badly needed the job, to support their families etc., how can they suddenly afford to quit? Wouldn't that make their financial situation much worse?
