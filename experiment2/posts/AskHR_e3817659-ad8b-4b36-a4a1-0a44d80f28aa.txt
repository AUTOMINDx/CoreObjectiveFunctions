[NY] to PA: my boss is crazy and I am afraid she will try to sabotage me when I leave
I have good references from all my past employers.  My current boss doesn’t foster a good work environment… problem oriented, breaks down, throws headset, talks behind everyone’s back, blames her problems on others instead of trying to problem solve… it’s so bad I needed to write our staffs workflow tasks because when she went to do it she gets frustrated and throws the whole day into chaos.  Before I go on I will say I think this stems from underlying mental problems she doesn’t have addressed and think she needs help, I don’t believe her to be a bad person.

She is however impulsive and irrational.  My greatest fear is I get a job offer and they want to speak with my current employer instead of just my older references from my past 3 jobs….  I am scared to tell new employers because I am afraid it will make me look like I have conflicts with my superiors… but don’t want them to reach out during her bad days and her playing it out to look like I cause her issues…

Do employers even do this? What do I do?
