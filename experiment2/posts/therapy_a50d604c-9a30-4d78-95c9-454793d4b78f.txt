I struggle to maintain or value relationships
It’s starting to freak me out honestly. I can cut people out of my life at the drop of a hat, no matter the history. I “grieve” and move on. I have a strained relationship with most of my family because I won’t reach out to them for weeks/months at a time and I don’t feel the need too. I’m 26 and I have never been in a a relationship either, it’s way too exhausting thinking of living with someone or have to talk to them daily. I have lived by myself for 5 years. 

My sister that is my favorite (we actually have a relationship.) and I got into a bit of a tiff last night because she just bought a house and she doesn’t want me bringing my foster dog even though she has a dog (she lives about an hour away and I didn’t want to leave the dog alone too long) I understand but she way she argued with me rubbed me severely the wrong way. It’s a 13 pound Boston terrier that doesn’t do anything (she was recently rescued from a puppy mill) and she said I could keep the dog outside if I brought her.it’s going to be 45 the day I go + the dog has never been outside until recently. The lack of compassion really frustrated me and I am contemplating not even going. 

I know it’s childish but the irritation I feel is enough to just ghost my sister and not talk to her for a while. I just don’t care, it’s not even that I want to make a point or cause problems I would rather just ghost/block people even if I have a relationship then deal with issues. 

It’s an embarrassing trait I have and I wish I knew how to fix it.
