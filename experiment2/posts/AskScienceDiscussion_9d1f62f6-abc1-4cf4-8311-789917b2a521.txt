Would cooling off the exhaust gas of a steam turbine at the turbine's outlet yield an increase in efficiency?

In the image there's two theoretical steam turbines.

Both  of them have identical temperature input. The difference being that  turbine A exhausts steam into the atmosphere with no extra steps, while  turbine B would have a supply of cold air being supplied at the start of  the turbine's exhaust and then exhaust it into atmosphere.

Am I correct in assuming this would increase efficiency over turbine A?

My  thinking is that steam contracts when cooled so this would create a low  pressure zone right at the exit of the turbine and in turn create a  sort of pulling force for the subsequent steam to come? Gaining us  efficiency through dumping of built up temperature?
