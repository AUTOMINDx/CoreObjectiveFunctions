AITA for embarrassing my BIL in front of family?
I(45M) work as high school math teacher and my husband(50M) works as a lobbyist. I am very happy with my profession and don't care what other people say. My BIL(48M) and I do not get along because he hates that we are a gay couple. He is also jealous that I am working and he was fired from his previous job.

We were celebrating the holidays with his family and my BIL started cracking jokes about my job. During dinner he asks so Dan(fake name), do kids make fun of you for being gay? I look back at him and say No BIL, if you have a problem with me, write the problem on a piece of paper, fold it, and shove it up your ass. Everyone looks at me and my husband starts laughing. BIL's face looks like he's about to faint and excuses himself from the table.

BIL and MIL have been blowing up my phone with texts and calls calling me out on what I said. BIL is demanding that I apologize.
