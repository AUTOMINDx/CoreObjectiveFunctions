Transference from 2nd intake appointment?!— normal?
I think I have negative transference from my second intake appointment (we went over into two because there was a LOT) where I was triggered and dissociated frequently. I look at it objectively and I don’t think he actually did anything wrong, but I think I have some transference going on (have never experienced transference with a therapist before so it’s kind of scary). 

Is it normal to have transference at this point? I’ll be discussing it at my next appointment and seeing if it can be worked through and trust can be built (I have some ideas on this).
