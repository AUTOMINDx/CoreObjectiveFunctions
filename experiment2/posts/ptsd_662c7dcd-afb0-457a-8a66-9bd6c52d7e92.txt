Long Term Exposure Therapy is a lot more successful when regression is not a problem
I see long term exposure therapy as a lifestyle. A miracle sent by God to help us recover from the evil in the world. I started in 2014.

Recently, some of my symptoms have been getting better, one being regression, which was severe in my case. Today I had to take my dog into the vet for a similar reason to about 10 years ago, and I realized how much more effective the experience is without regression. 

I think we have watched kids work out their trauma through play, but a lot of that is still done with the subconscious. I feel as if regression does the same. As an adult, we are able to process the trauma more consciously, which I hope helps in processing my PTSD memory loss for good.
