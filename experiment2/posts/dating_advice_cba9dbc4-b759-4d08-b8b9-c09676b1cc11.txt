No response to “ I had a good time “ after third date
So Saturday night went out with a girl for the third time, she asked to come back to my place and we hooked up that night and when we woke up. Before she left she seemed a little distant (can’t think of anything). I asked her to text when she got home and I got nothing, so I asked 2hrs later if she made it back. She said yea. Told her I enjoyed the night as a whole and that was over 24hrs ago and nothing.

Honestly if she doesn’t want to see me again that’s fine, not sure what it could be. But I’m thinking of just seeing a message today saying “hey, everything cool? You seemed a little distant before you left, and you always respond”

I’m honestly just tired of doing the thing where we just stop talking without any explanations. I’d rather just be told it’s over and move. Guess my question is should I message her that?
