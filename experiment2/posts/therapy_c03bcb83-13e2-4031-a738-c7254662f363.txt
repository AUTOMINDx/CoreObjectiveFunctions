therapy related question
I am starting therapy with one therapist online on Wednesday. However, while I had really appreciated our initial discussion I am now wondering if I should even go ahead with her. The reasons are - 

\- she sent me a client information request form from another person's email id. Now, please note that the last name is the same of both the ids. So, maybe this person is her husband or maybe her son. 

\- she then sent me a paypal request (I do not have a paypal) from a completely different account. For exemple in the email it says "From...... (name of the person" For (name of the therapist)." 

I find all this very odd. She is a genuine person I get that but why send me different stuff from different emails, I mean you have now leaked the patient name to two people ? Or am I just over reacting ? I was so happy to have found someone. And now this stupidity. What adds salt to the injury is there is no absolutely no other body to the message in the emails. I don't get this. Please has anyone experienced this ? Additionally, should I continue or go ahead ? I don't have paypal, if she insists what to do ? If i cancel the therapy what should I say to her as the reason ? 

If anyone can help please...
