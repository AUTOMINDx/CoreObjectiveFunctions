people who live in denial do not represent or say the truth even if they believe that they do
our parents live in denial. they live in denial regarding their own trauma.

what my father says is not the truth. even if that voice is only in my head now. i know it to be not the truth. because my father lives in denial.

we never needed to be perfect in order for them to love us. they demanded us to be perfect because when we screwed up it reminded them of their own trauma and they can't face it. so they deny the truth of what was happening. the truth is that a kid has made a mistake and that is OKAY.

i know that my father doesn't say the truth. even if that voice is only in my head.

i know better now. i'm smarter now.

allow yourself to love yourself. you never needed to be perfect for that to happen.
