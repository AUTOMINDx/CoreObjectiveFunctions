No Reasons to live
I am very lonely and unhappy in my life, I donâ€™t have reasons to live i dont produce anything, all i do is consume entertainment videos and eat food.
I lost the people i loved, i lost the bonds i had and now i am at a crossroad in what I should do with my life.

I am not interested in my course as i once was just a few weeks ago and now it feels like a chore.
I have no social life in this new town, i just want to go home, but how can i when i have not accomplished a single thing, it would be too shameful to show my face to my friends and family in a worse position than when i left them.
How can i get better at this thing called life? How do i make friends? How do i get a girl to love me for who i am?
How do i love myself?
I have so many questions but no one to ask them to, if you can assist me please leave some advice below.
