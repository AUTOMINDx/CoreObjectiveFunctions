Am I overthinking?
So I'm 4 dates in with a guy I'm seeing. They've all gone really well and he's even said how he really likes me and has never felt so comfortable around someone before.

His background is that he's only about two months out of his last relationship and I'm the first guy he's dated since the break up (note I say dated!)

My overthinking comes from a few things. First, he has rescheduled a date because he was too tired and then another date he organised he had to postpone shortly after because he forgot he had other plans. He's always trying to reschedule and is very keen to meet but I just keep thinking I'm not a priority.

Secondly, he told me he had to go for an STI test because of a hook up he had before we met. It was good that he was honest with me, but it makes me think he's seeing other people while dating me. I shouldn't have a problem with this because we're not exclusive, but it still hurts. I know he's still active on the apps too, but don't know for sure if he's met anyone.

There are other small things like being a slow texter, having a very busy social life and him only recently being out of a relationship that just add to all of the above.

I just can't seem to stop obsessing about all these things and what they mean. I end up unintentionally playing games like pretending I'm not available because he wasn't available on the night I asked him out. Its so stupid, I know. Am I right to be thinking about these things? How do you draw the line between red flags and overthinking about minor things?
