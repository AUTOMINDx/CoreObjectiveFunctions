I feel like I am getting more anxious about therapy again.
So I have a therapy appointment tomorrow and I am honestly anxious about it. I am going to be communicating with my T about stuff that’s happened over the past week, including what my psych has told me and a new med I’m starting. I find that I am getting more anxious because I feel like I’m losing myself I suppose. Like I lived a lie. I know this may sound really dramatic, or at least it does to me but I am finding out things about myself. Like there are a few things that I may have been misdiagnosed with in childhood and as a teen and I always carried these labels. I am now finding out that I may not have had the disorders I was diagnosed with as a kid and may actually have a different disorder. One that I really don’t want to accept if it is true. I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t want to deal with it anymore. I want to take a break, but I know it won’t help me. I won’t heal by running. I have to keep moving forward but I am honestly scared. Does everyone put this much weight into a diagnosis or am I over reacting? I haven’t even been diagnosed yet but I have been told what the working diagnosis is and that alone scares me. I assume I should bring this up in therapy haha. I am honestly just venting about it I suppose but I do wonder if other people feel this way as therapy goes on.
