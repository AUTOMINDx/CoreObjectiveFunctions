My gf has PTSD - What can I do?
TW: Divorce

My girlfriend has recently been diagnosed with PTSD related to the very messy divorce of her parents when she was a kid. We've only been dating for about 6 months and we've had a lot of ups and downs but this would explain part of it.
However, I am wholly unequiped to deal with this  or help her and my natural instincts when she's anxious or annoyed (such as cuddling, finding something to do or helping her with whatever she is doing) find rejection and her getting more annoyed, so I've stopped doing it which feels inherently wrong. I find that all my instinctual ways to try and make her feel better in these moments are wrong and don't help her or improve the situation.
I have little knowledge of PTSD and find it very hard to put into context, especially since it's taking a large toll on the relationship too. I just want to find ways in which I can support her and help her. Do you have some tips or help for me Reddit?
