My mother and sister ruined my birthday
So I wanted to have a quiet birthday and wanted to focus on finishing my assignments as well (due on my birthday)but then I bought a cake for myself, ate most of it then I’m going to eat pizza later to celebrate that I am 21 years old. 

Can someone please tell me why my sister gave me a sinister smile when she found out that I bought food for myself? My mother made comments about my eating habits - I don’t really eat like this. 

My sister made a comment that I ordered food and looked like she was going to laugh. 

But yeah, my birthday sucked.
