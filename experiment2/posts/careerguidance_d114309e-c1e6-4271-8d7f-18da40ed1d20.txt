Anyone else here hold down two full time WFH jobs?
So at the beginning of 2020, the company I’m actually leaving next week from, allowed us to start working from home. At first it was busy but after I got some major website projects done, it turned into maintenance work. Made WFH life great. I was able to do freelance work at will and enjoy time with my dog. But then I realized, huh maybe I can do another full time job. Long story short, I landed another one, fully remote. Definitely helps with the bills and also wedding planning finances too! 

As mentioned earlier, I am leaving job one to go to a new job, but it’s only replacing job one and not my second one. I’m still doing two jobs. 

I may be a colossal idiot, but so far things have worked out okay. Just wanted to see if others here are in a similar situation?

I am a graphic designer that is tapping into the UI//UX field btw
