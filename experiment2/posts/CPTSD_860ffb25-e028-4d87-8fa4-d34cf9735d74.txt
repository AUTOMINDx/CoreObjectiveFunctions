Is this an emotional flashback?
I just spent this past weekend at my grandma’s house and twice while I was watching a football game with her, I experienced a very familiar feeling I hadn’t felt in years.

I was suddenly overcome with a feeling I have never really been able to describe. I just feel really really dirty, like filthy to the core. Not like physically dirty, but like my entire psychological self is rotten. I don’t exactly feel disgusted with myself or ashamed of myself—there is some slight overlap with those feelings, but I can differentiate this feeling from both of those feelings. The closest thing I can compare it to is if you filled a trash bag in the shape of my body with rotting garbage from a landfill. That’s almost exactly what it feels like.

Is this what an emotional flashback is? I think what triggered it was watching football at my grandma’s house. My parents often took us to my grandma’s house and would watch football for hours. I was often miserable because my parents would abuse us on the long car ride there and back, and I had nowhere else to go and had to contain my emotions in front of my grandparents. So I would sit there in silence on the verge of tears watching a game I didn’t understand with no one to talk to.

I was emotionally abused but never sexually abused. I’ve heard of SA survivors saying they feel dirty but I think what I experience may be different from that. Can’t say for sure.
