Installing SSD from prior PC
Hi all, 

My former PC unfortunately BSOD, but it had two nice SSDs in it. I bought a new PC about a year back that had a smaller SSD and larger HDD in it. I'd like to install my SSDs from my old PC into my new one for storage purposes, but have honestly held off because I don't have even an inkling of what I need to do next.

Any guidance folks could provide would be much appreciated! Thank you!
