Helping my family get into the holiday spirit while grieving a loss.
Hello!

I am not certain if this is the best place to ask this question, but I was wondering how I could help get my family in the holiday spirit, specifically my mom. My grandma (my mom's mom) passed away in September of this year, so it will be our first Christmas without her. We were very very close, so it is difficult for everyone. We did not live in the same country as my grandma, so with travel restrictions, we were not able to see her for 2+ years and it is making us all have a lot of regrets.  


I am finding it hard to get into the holiday spirit. I feel incredibly empty and I cry a lot, but in private because I have to be strong and carry on. I am a university student (working from home of course) so I am overloaded with work right now, but I am the oldest sibling and I **really** want to make sure my mom and siblings are okay and will take as much time as I need to in order to ensure she has a good and happy Christmas.

Do you have any advice on how to do this? Do you think I should try to distract my mom and my entire family during December and January? I am willing to do anything to keep everyone happy. Everything has been strained and stressful because of COVID anyways, and this has just not been a very good year. I will try to make as much of the food that they like and play Christmas music and try to get us out of the house doing things like going skating and on hikes. It might become a bit draining to put in a lot of this effort to always be on the move, but I don't really know what else to do and it will be worth it. I can't wait to get my winter break in about 2-3 weeks so I can be fully present.   


Sorry this message is long. I just feel anxious with school and life and am finding it hard to be happy but want to make sure everyone around me is happy. My priority is my mom, do you know how I can help her?

thank you so much. lots of love &lt;3
