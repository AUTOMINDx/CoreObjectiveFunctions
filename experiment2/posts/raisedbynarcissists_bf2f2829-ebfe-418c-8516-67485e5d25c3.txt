I got my own phone, thank you so much everyone
I did it you guys. It's not much, just getting and paying for my own phone, but I did it! No more tracker, no more ability to cut off my service, it's completely mine! 

And I never would've done it if it weren't for the amazing helpful people in this sub. Y'all have some fantastic advice, and thanks to you, I have more freedom now than I had thought I'd be able to have. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
