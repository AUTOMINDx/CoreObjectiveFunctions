don't know what to do next
hi. I've been dealing with agoraphobia for about 4 years and still on going. While dealing with it, I had been able to go to college and managed to work part time job but I had to dropped out of college due to the stress and pressure. The same thing goes for my part job, I managed to complete the three month contract but I didn't sign on further because I was losing sleep so much and I couldn't stop overthink about it if I had work on that day. 

Then covid hits and it was kind of a good excuse to put everything on pause but now things are going back to the new normal I have to manage my life somehow. So here is it, I don't know where to go from here. I am thinking of continuing my studies since I dropped out but I doubt my parents are going to pay for my school fees so maybe I have to get a job. All these things are making me stressed. It's December and 2022 is a just a month away now. Could someone give me an idea on how I could restart my life back? I don't want to sit around at home like an idiot. I'll surely work on my exposure soon but what comes after that? 

I have been depending on my family all these while and I'm ashamed of that. I've been seeing my friends on social media they are having a good stable life and I want that honestly. To be able to work or go to school.
