When using alcohol based hand sanitizer, do only the cell membranes of the bacteria get dissolved or does some of my skin also get dissolved?
I would think that for a sanitizer to be safe to use over and over, that it shouldn't damage the skin cells.

Also, with COVID many hand sanitizers are ethanol based. Is any of this ethanol able to cross the skin and enter the blood?
