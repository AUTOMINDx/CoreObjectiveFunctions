GI Doc Recommending Nissan Fundoplication
Hello everyone,

 I've been dealing with acid reflux for a little over a year now. It's been pretty rough as my GERD is pretty severe. I've had all the tests done to include a scope that found Barrets Esophagus and ph test. My nocturnal reflux is pretty bad as well. The biggest issue is that stuff is always coming back up into my throat and sitting there where I can feel it. This happens even with PPIs and dietary changes. My main side effect is that I become very nauseated when this happens making me feel miserable. My GI doc is strongly recommending I get a procedure called a Nissan Fundoplication and aparently this will drastically reduce stuff coming up in my throat and get my life back. 

My question is has anyone here had this procedure done and if so did it work for you? 

I'm leaning heavily to get this done as there's not much left to do at this point but I would really live to hear people experiences and feedback.

Thanks in advance!
