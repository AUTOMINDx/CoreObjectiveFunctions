If you’re male and struggling with Tinder... here might be why
Tinder has less than 1:4 female-to-male ratio (US)

According to stats on Statista...

Don’t know how this fares for other regions but I would’ve thought imho that it’s similar.

Tinder still has that “hook-up” brand and appeal IMO. As such, will probably attract less women...

That means there’s 4 dudes for every girl... may the odds ever be in your favour :/
