New to soldering, are these the right tools?
\*Sorry for the vague title\*

I recently have been wanting to get into soldering, but tbh I am quite confused as to what the essential tools are. Down below I have a list of items that I think fit my needs (some of these are on the stickied thread) these will be used mainly to fix consoles.

List:

\[Iron\]([https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/)) Also looking into the PinePower Desktop, but OoS atm.

I also am looking at some tip cleaners such as wire types, and sponges. Still kind of confused about flux. I bought solder already. Is this all I need in order to get started? Are these worth the price? I realize the microscope isn't necessary but it seems like a good deal. I'd appreciate some help, thanks in advance!
