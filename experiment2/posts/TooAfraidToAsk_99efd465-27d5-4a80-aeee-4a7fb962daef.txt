Can you close a dead person's eyes like in the movies?
You see it all the time. The person dies in the arms of the main character in a deeply emotional scene, eyes still gazing off into the great nothing. Then the main character gently brushes their hand over the decedent's face (sometimes it looks like they just wave *over* their face) and the eyes are now closed, as if they're sleeping. Is this realistic? Can freshly-dead eyelids simply be shut like that?
