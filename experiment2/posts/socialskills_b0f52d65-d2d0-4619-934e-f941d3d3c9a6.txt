I hate being the "quiet kid"
I'm 17m for context. Ever since I was young I was always known as the quiet kid in school. I still am. I've been at the same school for 13 years and I hate the stigma that's from me when people see me. My high school class is less than 30 people so we all know eachother. Something that hurt me the most was that I recently found out people used to call me a school shooter because of how I was so quiet. Even my best friends. I only have one semester left before I graduate so I'm hoping I can "reset" in college. I know I shouldn't care what other people think of me but it's literally been going on for all my school life and I've been really depressed at school partly because of this. I'm not sure what to do or what I'm asking for, maybe just reassurance, but it at least helps to write it all down here.
