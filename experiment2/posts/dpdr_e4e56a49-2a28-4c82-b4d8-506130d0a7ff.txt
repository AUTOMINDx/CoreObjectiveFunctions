Does anyone feel like bright lights are a trigger? Especially at night?
Went to a Christmas lights show near my home and realized that looking at the bright lights and decorations brought me to reality, but as soon as I looked away DR hit super hard. Way worse than anything else.

I've always had this really strange sensation when I would look at Street lights and Christmas lights at night time. But never realized what it was till I learned about DPDR just recently.
