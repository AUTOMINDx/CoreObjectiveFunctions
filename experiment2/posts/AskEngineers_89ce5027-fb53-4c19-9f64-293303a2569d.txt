What is your perspective on the management of contractors building/implementing designs?
You can differentiate if they're your/your organizations designs or something else.

I came from an engineering team where we had a lot of faith in our contractors. It wasn't uncommon to give them a call sometimes for their knowledge if we needed it.

A Field engineer was more or less a quick check up on progress, and if any issues have been encountered.

I realize this is not the case for everyone. Even within my own organization, I had assisted another team and I vividly remember a conversation with another field engineer that went like this

&amp;#x200B;

"Tadpole, why aren't you nervous like me??"

&amp;#x200B;

"Well, this is a really cool project, I'm glad to be a part of it, and the contractors are the ones working their own specialized equipment, so we can see it in action!"

&amp;#x200B;

"Aren't you worried they're going to screw everything up???"

&amp;#x200B;

"Why would they do that?"

&amp;#x200B;

"Tadpole, contractors are shady as fuck!"

Of course, it just wasn't her that was like this. Her boss was even worse. When the contractor wasn't meeting the amount of work they said they could perform, instead of her boss reaching out to them and asking, he tasked us with watching their every. single. move. and documenting it all. He even wanted us to write if they went to the bathroom. It was utterly ridiculous, stressful, and felt like it created an awful work environment. 

And guess what, it wasn't even something they were doing. We ended up reaching out to the manufacturer of the product and it was recommended we do something additional (at the manufacturer's cost, their suggestion) which fixed the quota issue!
