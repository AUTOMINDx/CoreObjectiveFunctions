My boyfriend (22) and I (20) don't talk much, basically at all.
My boyfriend and i have been dating for four months. We moved quite fast, met his family, did the deed, etc. all under 3 months. When we started talking, I didn't even want a relationship, but I am the the type of person who can't say no when others are happy. I figured that over time, I'd be happy as well. And I was/am, we have fun, go on adventures, and chill. but we only really talk once a week. We have a streak longer than our own conversations. He won't message me first, it's always gotta be me. we do not communicate in any way other than snapchat. 

I think that we both jumped at the opportunity of not being alone anymore and made it work. He tells me he's happy and I can truly see that, but I only see it on the one day we see each other. I know he won't break up with me, He made it seem like he wanted to once, but that quickly got changed I guess. Sometimes I wish he was different, but once I realized that I started wishing that, I started realizing that maybe I should break up with him and save us a heart break and time. I need help, I hate hurting people. I don't want to hurt him. We enjoy each other's company but i know for sure that it's not love. what do i do? Keep going with this relationship that seems to be more of a friends with benefits situation and pretend like eventually we'll fall in love or just break up with him and hope for the best?
