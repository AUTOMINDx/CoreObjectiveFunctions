How do I approach women at the gym? I am a 24 year old female and just want to ask other adult females if they want to join a rugby team. I am shy and haven't approached anyone yet. Yet!
I am a female and I just want to recruit other females to join our rugby team. 

I'm pretty shy, I haven't gone up to a single female yet. I really want to help recruit and practice my social skills. 

When is it appropriate to approach a female and introduce myself and ask.

I posted in another thread and they said ask to work out between sets, build rapport, and then bring it up.

Idk about this because I dress kinda gay and don't want them to think I'm a creep and hitting on them. 

I understand ppl go there to just to get their work in,  don't want to be disturbed, and just leave.

Would a cold approach be appropriate? So I can just straight up know if they want to play rugby or not? 

Or workout between sets if it's a female alone, the things I think I'd get rejected because I'm obviously gay (fem) and they'd think I'm a creep etc. 

If it's a group or couple, I was thinking the cold approach, not sure. I mean wouldn't it be weird if I worked out w a couple or group? Idk.

I'd love some advice, Thanks! Appreciate it.ðŸ™‚

Edit-!!!! They said I can't put up flyers. It's ufc
