I have questions about the 'awareness' of NParents
I'll try to be clearer:

How *intentional* do you think their behaviour was? Like, do they think they're doing everything right and we're just rotten, ungrateful children? 

Or do they know - deep down - that what they're doing is wrong and fucked up, and they find some kind of twisted joy in it - but they know better than to admit it?

I've seen a few stories here where people have seen their NParents 'mask' slip and they've shown some kind of joy at the pain they cause. I feel like deep down my N Mom knows that she deliberately hurt me because it was fun for her/gave her a sense of control - but everyone else is convinced she's just 'made some mistakes'.

So, I was wondering about opinions in this group.
