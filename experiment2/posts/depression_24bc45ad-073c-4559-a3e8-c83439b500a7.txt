Smoking helps my depression. I need your advice :)
Iam 21 yo male. I currently live with my parents and work full time. I miss the university life but i cant get it again and is one factor which weighs me down. Anyways, smoking the green once a week just helps me ease my thoughts and anxiety i have regarding my future life. It brings a small relaxation to end the week on. ( I smoke the green). So my question is, is it bad to smoke to help relax? And also should i risk being caught by parents. A part of me wants to be caught by them so i can be forced to tell them the anxiety i have been having for the past month. What is the right thing to do?
