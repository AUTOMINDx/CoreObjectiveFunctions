I don’t feel like we’re going back …
Long story short 

We moved from my hometown to a new state back in May , in sept we drove back down to my said hometown and this is where we have been since September I bug my mom almost everyday and ask her when are we going back . It hasn’t been the best experience and I’m kinda ready to go back to the place I renamed “home”. 

However everyone around me is saying it doesn’t look like she wants to go back because she has piled on excuse after excuse each month to the point I don’t even ask anymore I’m completely miserable here and I’m reminded everyday on why I hated it to begin with . I’m in college and I didn’t plan on spending the remainder of my year on my relatives couch when I have a house in the next state . Each holiday Halloween thanksgiving and now Christmas I’ve been told we would leave by then and we havnt we are still paying rent and bills on the place and it just seems very wasteful and counterproductive considering there is still NO solid return date I don’t have it in me to go back individually on my own it’s a 10 hour drive and I don’t like doing the public transportation thing , and it just seems like my mom moved there didn’t really like it but didn’t wanna admit it  or let anybody down and now we’re back to square one which is living with my relative going on 3 months I’m putting my life on pause being here and I don’t know how to face this situation , when I bring it up to ask she gets mad yells at me and shuts me down along with other family members adding in . In so many words she says she’s not going back even though we left everything there and unfortunately I was set on this particular place I don’t know what to do at all now and it’s going on December.
