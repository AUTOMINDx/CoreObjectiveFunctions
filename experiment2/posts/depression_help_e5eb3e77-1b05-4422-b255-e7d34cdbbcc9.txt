Is it time to give in to my suicidal thoughts
I'm not sure why im on here i think ive just lost all hope and am looking for a way to vent

Ive had some sort of depression/bipolar disorder since i was little i know it through a free legit therapist lady but never diagnosed since i dont have the money for it and dont rlly know how to anyways. Im 20 and live alone because my parents are assholes and i have the need to be alone 99% of the time. I had online shops to pay the bills but recently i decided to go back to school and get a diploma but this was probably the worst mistake i ever made... 

I totally underestimated the time school would take which made me unable to work on my stores untill they eventually became unprofitable and i went broke very very fast cus of a series of unfortunate events i cant all go in.

Now here i am hungry, sleepless, about to lose my only safe space my apartment in 3 months, gonna go in debt, i have to quit school to go work a real life job which is a nightmare for me because i have mad anxiety around people. all this combined with my bipolar disorder resulted in my mental health completely crashing

I cant go into my whole life story but basically unfortunate shit like this happens to me almosy ever 1-2 years and i always fall into a pit of depression always woth suicidal thought almost comitting to it once but i always managed to climb back out stronger then ever.

But this time its very different because i am on a looping path with no hope and only struggle

My mind is going absolutely crazy making me unable to function properly making all these situations harder because i dont even know what to do anymore i am unable to sleep for whole nights, im  trembling a lot not sure why but cant even roll a joint anymore to ease my mind

On top of the crazy overthinking i have constant suicidal thoughts

I always knew from when i was kid i wasn't going to make it far and that i would just end it one day because i am not made for this i feel like i would be much better off just dead instead of struggling my whole life

On the positive side i havent fallen into a drug addiction again
