How do I get over the fact that not everyone will (platonically) like me?
I've come to the realization that I handle not being liked by people really, really badly. For some reason whenever I become friends with people, my mind demands that I have to be their *best* friend, that I have to be their funniest, most likable, number one friend. And it's kinda insane to aspire to that level in every friendship. 


I recognize it's neither healthy nor possible to be everyone's number one, but I still feel so hurt whenever I feel like someone may find someone else more enjoyable to be around. Recently a girl who doesn't really like me and I don't really like her invited a few of our mutual friends to hangout and excluded me. I'm obviously hurt by it, but neither of us particularly like each other (not for bad reasons, we just don't vibe) and I've made plans in the past with mutual friends that've excluded her. So it's totally fair for her to exclude me given the circumstances, but I still can't help but wanting her approval and being liked by her even though I don't like her.


Like, what's wrong with me to crave the approval of literally everyone including people I don't like? How can I fix this?


And in general I end up feeling so fake since I'm essentially pretending to be a whole different person around everyone, literally just doing things for their approval, unable to make my own decisions.


I think part of the issue is that I have extremely low self esteem so I value myself based off the validation of others, but I don't know how to fix this issue. Also, if age matters, I'm 18.


**Tl;dr** I have a deep need to be liked and validated by everyone, even people I don't particularly like because I value myself based on other peoples' opinions. How can I fix this?
