How to I tell my mom she has bad BO?
She stinks. No nice way of putting it. I love her dearly, but the BO is awful. She doesn’t sweat through clothes or anything, but literally anytime she goes outside for even a few minutes she comes back with such a weird BO smell. And doing work around the house causes it too. It used to just be after exercise or hard work but lately got a lot worse. She has good hygiene and all that, but still stinky. She is almost 65 and has always been grossed out by people who smell, but I’m afraid to tell her she’s one of them now. It’s embarrassing when we go places!
