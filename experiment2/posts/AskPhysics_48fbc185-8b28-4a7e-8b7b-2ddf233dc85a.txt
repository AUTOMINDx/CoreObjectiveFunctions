How does a field cause a force? And what is a field in general?
Hello! I'm currently learning about electricity, magnetism and all of this stuff in school, but I'm struggling to understand what a field is and how it causes a force.

I watched some videos and I think I can slightly understand a very tiny bit about the concept of a field, but I still don't understand how a force appears. Like the electric field for example, from Khan Academy the narrator said that one charge's electric field causes a force on another charge that is in the area of the field. Does the force just appears out of nowhere? How does it appear? Or is the field some sort of ball of forces together?

Also how do particles like charges know where a field is? And does the field stretch everywhere or is it just like 5 or 2 or 1 meter and ends somewhere? 

Also also, does every charged particle has it's own electric field or is it just one massive field through the entire galaxy? If it's every particle, do the fields stack onto each other for infinity?

From what I've watched, supposedly fields are still unknown and mysterious, so if any of these questions can't be answered it's ok! I just want to at least understand a tiny bit more, thank you!
