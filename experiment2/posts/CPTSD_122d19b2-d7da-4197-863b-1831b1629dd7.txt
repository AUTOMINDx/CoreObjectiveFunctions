Sleep paralysis- it’s worth knowing this exists
My first experience with it I couldn’t move and assumed I was dying. It was terrifying.

It now happens rarely, usually when over tired. For me it involves the feeling of falling asleep but having a level of consciousness that causes hallucinations. For me they are audible hallucinations, for others they are visual. This is a sleep disorder - often associated with trauma - where your body goes into the appropriate sleep state or paralysis but your mind is still aware and hallucinates.

If you have difficulty with sleep please look this up, although sleep paralysis is still awful it is a little better to know that there isn’t some horrible supernatural thing happening to you.
