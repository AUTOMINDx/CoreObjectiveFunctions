Anxiety skin picking
Whenever I am in and anxious situation I usually pick at the lower corner of my thumbnail (lower right, lower left for left). Once I’m done I won’t even notice until I’ve picked so much I’m bleeding. 

Lately I’ve cut my thumbnail too short and noticed I use my pinky nail to get under the tender skin. It hurts, but for some reason I can’t stop. After my thumb nail grew out and couldn’t reach under the nail I’ve picked a few layers of skin off so it’s tender and I dig into it with my pinky nail. Again, it hurts, but I can’t stop.

I know it sound la crazy and I’ve never told this to anyone but it’s becoming a real problem and any advice is appropriated. Thank you.
