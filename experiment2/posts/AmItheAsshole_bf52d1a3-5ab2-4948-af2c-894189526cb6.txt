AITA For Ignoring My Autistic Roommate?
This is so dumb and childish, but here we go!

Me (30NB), my friend 27 (M), and a former co-worker (26F) all moved in together - I needed a new place because I couldn't afford my old apartment, my friend was living in an unsafe area, and former co-worker was homeless.

It started off great! We moved into a two bedroom apartment, she got the other room and while friend and I share the master bedroom. It started off alright - friend and I, of course, are closer but we made attempts to include her but she refused. Made it clear we weren't friends and never will be. Okay.

Then. Then she stopped going to work. Three weeks. Told us about a week before rent was due that her rent was going to be late. Okay. She quit her job but "decided to go back'.

We received a letter from our landlord three weeks after: "Pay your rent or move out in three days". We confronted her, she said that "she's autistic, under a lot of stress, in a psychotic state and we should have **asked** if everything was okay." And tried to play my own illness against me. (She also lets the cats on the counter and feeds them foods they shouldn't have and thinks she's Jackson Galaxy).

Then, she decided that she shouldn't:

Pay me for electricity or internet.  
Shouldn't do the household chores because "she's only ever in her room, in the dark"

We were pissed, once again, called her out on it. She made excuses. Autism. Depression. Etc. Etc. Tried to play roommates therapist because he started doing something concerning again, he told her to fuck off.

She tried to play my own illness against me again (BPD) by claiming I'm splitting on her, and not because **I'm upset with her.**

The other night, she decided 9 pm would be a good time to pick up a bedframe, and then got mad because the door was locked at 12:30 a.m. when she decided to finally come home. I made plans to call the cops Just In Case, went out to check, saw her car in the drive way. Went back in, and then decided to see if she was in her car before calling the cops. "Coincidentally", she came in just at that time. Don't like that.

So now, every time she tries to talk to us, we pretend she's not there.

AITA for this?
