Weird Twist cylinder tool attached to a protractor, name?
Title is the summary. There is this tool that I got at my new internship and I am wondering if anyone knows the name of it actually. Essentially its a cylinder that twists that converts common length units to any desired unit type. It was attached to a protractor when I first got it, so I wanted to see if anyone has seen or knows that the name of the actual tool is called.
