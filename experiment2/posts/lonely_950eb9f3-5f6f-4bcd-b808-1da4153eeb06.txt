gf broke up with me. she was my last true friend
Started dating my gf in Oct 2018, had a small group of friends around then, 2 good friends and a few acquaintances. gf didn’t exactly get along super well with my friends so i ended up talking to her more than anyone else and spending most of my time with her. Slowly stopped talking to all of my friends at the time. last year she was the only friend i talked to outside of family.

She left me in October, i’ve never been this lonely in my life. I’ve started talking to my old friends a little bit but i can see that i’m no longer as important to them as they are to me. I’m still in contact with my ex even though it does nothing but make me upset, i just need to talk to someone and she’s the only one that starts conversations anymore.

I don’t know what the point of this post is, it just feels good to write how i’m feeling
