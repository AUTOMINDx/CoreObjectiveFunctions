Everything makes me anxious.
This is mostly just a way for me to work through things by typing it out but feel free to leave similar experiences or suggestions.

For the past few months everything has been making me anxious and it’s getting increasingly worse. It can be as simple as choosing where I go to get lunch and as complex as deciding what I want to study in college. It’s almost to the point that leaving the house or even getting out of bed is impossible. Every little thing gives me so much anxiety it’s almost crippling. Unfortunately I don’t have the luxury of letting it pull me down. I have to act like normal bc I have no time for my issues and my family and friends have too much going on to handle my burden.

I’ve seen a psychologist in the past and the strategies I was taught were things that I’d already figured out on my own. I have a weird mental block that makes me not want to take meds. I really like being self sufficient and don’t want to have to depend on meds to get through my day.
