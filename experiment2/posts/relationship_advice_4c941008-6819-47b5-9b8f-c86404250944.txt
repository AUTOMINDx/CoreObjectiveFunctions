I [F,26] am a rebound girl and can’t figure out why
A friend already told me I’m a rebound girl, I was questioning it until this week :( For the past 6 years I’ve had a streak. Some examples:

Guy tells me he likes me, we start hanging out, I confess to him that I caught feelings - he confesses that there’s another girl and he’s been using me to feel better because she’s not interested in him.
Guy suggests to go to his place, I say I want to get to know each other first, he says he’s not ready for a serious relationship - gets a gf less than a month later.
Guy is supersweet with me, I start catching feelings and… he comes out and starts dating guys.
Guy slides in my DMs, friend tells me he just got cheated on and broke up with his gf.
Guy is engaged and I see them fighting, tells me in private that he had a crush on me in the past, he is way too nice to me in front of his fiance, suddenly I don’t see them for a week and then they’re back on track.

List goes on and on and I’m tired of it.

Tdlr: I want to know what signals I might be sending out to others that makes them use me as a rebound
