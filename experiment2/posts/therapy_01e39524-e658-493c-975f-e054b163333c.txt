My dad is saying He's right even though he's wrong
Hi, so I most likely have ADHD but my parents won't let me get tested. Around the middle of the year I spent 3 days hyper focusing on research and doing a few online tests. I know not all tests can be trusted but I only did 2. I decided to tell my dad that I'm pretty sure I have ADHD yesterday, now he's saying he did research and listening to music distracts me (I haven't been listening to music I've been listening to podcasts which I know distracts me) I have a school project to do but it isn't important. My dad can be abusive both mentally and physically and I always push him whenever I want to get my point across. I feel that even if I do have ADHD he's gonna get mad when I do something that actually helps me and tries to get me to do something that wont. He absolutely loves using 'I guess you'll go work at mcdonalds the rest of your life' line but he goes really far into detail and makes me feel extremely shitty and I cry hard. I can't get proper therapy cuz we don't have the money and I most likely have depression too. My dad has pushed me to a suicide attempt after he made me feel like shit. I just need some help and sorry this was a bit all over the place.
