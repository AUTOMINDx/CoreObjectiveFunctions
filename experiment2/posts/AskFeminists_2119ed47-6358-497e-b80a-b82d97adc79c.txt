Do regulations on vaccination violate the feminist principle of bodily autonomy?
Hi everyone,


By regulations, I’m not talking about pinning people down and forcing them to take it, I’m talking about various policies around the likes of work, leisure and travel that are being implemented across many countries here in Europe. For the record, I am pro-vaccination and double jabbed so there is no need to try and convince me about taking the vaccine. I am here because I was told I was a bad feminist for supporting regulations.


I am aware that this question has been  asked before but I wanted to ask it again because after another year of COVID, and many countries now re-entering lockdowns, I feel that there is reason to assume that people’s perspectives may have changed a bit.
