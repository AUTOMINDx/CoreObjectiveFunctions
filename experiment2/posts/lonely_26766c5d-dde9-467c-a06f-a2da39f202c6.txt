Why does rejection hurt so much
I was just about to ask a person out that I wanted to have a long term relationship with for four years now. I always figured they didn't like me like that, and I thought I could handle it. But after asking if they liked me, they said as friends only, and I thought I could handle it. But now I'm sitting here both confused and empty... what the hell do I do?
