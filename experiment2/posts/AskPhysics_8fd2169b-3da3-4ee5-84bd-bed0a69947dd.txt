If a person is pulling a box (with friction) at a given velocity and given a v(t) function, find force, work done, and power.
Can you explain the process of finding:

1. Force
2. Work done
3. Power

Friction exists.

There's no numerical values so explain as like:

"To find force, integrate \_\_\_\_, derive \_\_\_\_, plug in \_\_\_, etc."

Thank you so much!!
