slippery elm, DGL-licorice, marshmallow root
for those of y'all that use these supplements, how do you time it? i know they all can interfere with meds and vitamins, so i try to not take any if i have to take a med or vitamin within 2 hours (should i wait longer?), but what about food? will they interfere with absorbing nutrients from food if i take them too soon before or after eating? i also know that they can even interfere with each other. guess i'm just wondering what y'all have found to be helpful. also interested in any other supplements y'all are using. I take a gut-lining repair supplement as well that in addition to the above 3, also has fenugreek, L-Glutamine, and N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine. 

i stopped taking my PPI's about 2 weeks ago and now in addition to the above am taking pepcid twice a day and trying to stay on acid water diet. confused about how i should be taking these supplements though, god forbid you mention supplements at a doctor office they're not tryin to hear that. 

thanks in advance!
