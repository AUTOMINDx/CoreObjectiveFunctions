Authors that talk about rivalry or the relationship between oneself and a rival
Recently I've become interested in the idea of a rivalry. A few semesters ago I remember hearing someone saying that Aristotle said something about rivalry and how that relationship was different from an enemy and a friend.

Where does he talk about this more in depth? I am fairly new to Aristotle and I am beginning the Nicomachean Ethics I don't know if he will talk about this later in this book.

Do you have any other suggestion of other authors' take on this topic? I don't really know who has written about this topic.
