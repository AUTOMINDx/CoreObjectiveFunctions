Follow my heart or stability?
I’m currently stuck between Laboratory Medicine at University and Nursing.

I love working in the lab and have worked in labs during my undergraduate degree.
I also love the idea of potentially working in IVF or fertility.

I also love the idea of nursing but have never done anything like it, and if I did get into nursing I’d work in Mental Health nursing. 

My heart desperately wants me to go for laboratory medicine, but I’m so afraid of being jobless and working contract to contract.

I know nursing is somewhat stable where I am (Australia) but I’m just so confused between the two.

What is the best course of action?
