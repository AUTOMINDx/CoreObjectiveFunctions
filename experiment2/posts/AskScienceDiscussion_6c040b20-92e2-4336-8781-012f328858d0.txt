Are we sure there's no friction in the vacuum of space?
Did anyone model what would happen if there's tiny amounts of friction in vacuum (leaving aside why) and how would that effect galaxy formation and movement?

Like, so tiny that in all our experiments, objects in motion do stay in motion forever (while in vacuum) but what if that's not true over extreme distances?

Wouldn't the (improbable) particle-antiparticke spontaneous creation cause some friction over vast distances and time spans? Or even just random hydrogen atoms spread around?

(Not to mention something more exotic like kinetic energy leaking into higher dimensions).
