Early college coursework in your major - things to improve
Something that happened when I was in college more than 20 years ago, and I known it’s still a problem today is upperclassmen getting ready to graduate and figuring out they hate their major. 
 
Engineering is tough to explain to a lot of people who aren’t exposed to it as they grow up. You see a doctor. You may even see a lawyer (or see them on TV), but people don’t know what an engineer does. 
 
Then you get into college and you start grinding in physics, chemistry, calculus, etc…. before you know it you’re a sophomore/junior and it’s time to start taking classes in your major. 
 
Lots of people get to that point and then figure out they don’t like it. 
 
So one solution, besides getting TV characters based on our kind (drama, no BBT please), is to expose freshmen and even high schoolers into aspects of our jobs to expose them. 
 
So if you were writing a syllabus for a freshmen level course in your major that would expose students to what you do in your career?
 
Thanks.
