Who are the "Academics" in Augustine's Confessions?
Reading through Confessions at the moment and Augustine has mentioned the philosophers known as the "Academics" who seem to doubt if truth can ever be known by man, a sort of skeptic group. I've never heard this term before, so I am curious if it is a philosophy that Augustine refers to by a different name or if it was a group that has been long since forgotten to the ages.
