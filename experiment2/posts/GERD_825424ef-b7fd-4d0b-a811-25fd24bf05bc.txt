Can the same medication from different manufacturers act slightly differently?
I've been taking pepcid which is famotidine made in the USA I guess, I'm in Canada. And it works fine, I take it at night but by the morning I experience chest pain in the middle, and I also wake up at night and take tums. Then I ordered famotidine on ebay from another country and I don't feel like taking tums at night and in the morning the chest pain is almost none.
