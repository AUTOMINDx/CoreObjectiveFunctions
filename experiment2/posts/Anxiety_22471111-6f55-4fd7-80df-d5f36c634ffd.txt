you're loved and people care about you!
------ this is the same post i've done a couple hours back in another sub reddit and i got quite a few people that i felt really good talking with and helping out sorry for posting the same thing it's just that i truly mean every word and there really isn't anything else i could say, you're all loved &lt;3 -----

hey i'm here for you, if you need someone to talk with!

you're not alone! i'll gladly listen to how you feel, we can share stories and vent with each other.

no one deserves to go through anything alone and without love!

you won't be a burden, i'll reply asap every single time, i really hate seeing people suffer so much as i feel the same pain i've tried killing myself a couple years back and although my life keeps going downhill, yours doesn't have to!

sending love and hugs to everyone! you are all amazing human being and worthy of love and life!! &lt;3

love you all very much, please never ever give up!

once again if you need someone to talk with about anything at all i'm here for you :)
