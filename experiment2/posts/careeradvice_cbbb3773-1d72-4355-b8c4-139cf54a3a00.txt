Career shift
I am 32 and is working as a HR. Earning decently well too. However I feel I am not making an impact and it is not intellectually or creatively challenging. I did my research on UX field and seems like something I ll be passionate and good at. Would you recommend shifting careers at 32? Into something like Ux?
