My ex just had a miscarriage
My ex girlfriend (who I am still close to) was due next month. She and her partner were so anxious to be parents. (She was always told she could never get pregnant) Today they lost their baby. I want to send them something. I thought a peace lilly but they were going to name her Lilly so I feel that's a little insensitive. What should I do? What should I send?
