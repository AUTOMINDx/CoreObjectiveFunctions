I was walking to meet up with my friends and I could see them getting out of the car like 6 yards in front of me and I knew they were there. And I *knew* they were there. But like when they called out my name, it didn't feel like they were in front of me. I knew they were there and I knew that they were in front of me and that they were going to call out to me, but I like let it scare me and looked all around me for the source of the noise even though I knew it was my friends who were right in front of me. 

Like I feel guilty because I don't want to lie and that felt like an ingenuine reaction to me. I mean I know it's not my fault because I was hella derealizing but like

Idk I just feel guilty
