I wish “catching feelings” wasn’t viewed as a negative thing.
If I’ve been seeing someone for awhile who I begin to care about, why is that such a bad thing? I wish that in the dating world it wasn’t viewed as a touchy topic to begin to get feelings for someone you’re dating/seeing. It just seems natural to me.
