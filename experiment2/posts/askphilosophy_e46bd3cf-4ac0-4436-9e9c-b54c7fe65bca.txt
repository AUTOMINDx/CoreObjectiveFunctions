Identity and Personal Connections
I recently read a paper of Aliyyah I. Abdur-Rahman’s about the novel Giovanni’s Room (admittedly more literary than philosophical). In it, she brings up the idea of identity as something being defined by connections with other people: “Individuals are born into social worlds that precede them. Systems of meaning and communication are inherited. The trajectories of individual lives are determined in part by personal, familial, communal, and even national histories. If one’s identity is preconditioned always by social relations, sedimented material histories, and structures of both perception and habit, then how is any I an I without a we?”

I thought this was particularly interesting, but I’m no philosopher or social anthropologist— I was wondering if anyone on here could recommend any philosophers’ ideas or further reading that have to do with this subject? Thanks in advance!
