Battling mood shifts
I have very intense and vivid night terrors. They don’t escape my head throughout the day and my mood is shit toward my wife and kids all day because of it. I feel like an asshole. I’m not abusive, never have and never will be but I just feel like a grouchy old man who isnt pleasant to be around and I recognize it but cannot for the life of me pull myself out of these moods. I just recently went to the doctor and got medically diagnosed with moderate/ severe PTSD from all the murders and violent shit I’ve witnessed and been involved with controlling for the past several years. (ex LEO) I was prescribed antidepressants and a handful of other drugs to help but so far I haven’t noticed even a slight change. Is this something that I just have to live with or will this end at some point?
