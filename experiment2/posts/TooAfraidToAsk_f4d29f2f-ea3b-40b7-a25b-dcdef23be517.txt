What is Considered Racism?
I didn't really notice until I started talking with some of my black friends that I've experienced a few "racist" experiences. Especially in work and school. And Im confused if it could actually be called racism.

As a bit of a background, I'm from Southern GA in the USA. My hometown is majority African American at around 75%. Caucasian population is around 22% with other races filling in the remaining 3%. 

From what I've read about racism it has more to do with the association of a specific race to the power structure of the area. In this area the power structure is mostly African led, from the government, to jobs, to schools. 

In a case like this is it still racial prejudice due to GA and, US government in general, still being majority white? Or would it just be considered racism because the local government is majority black?
