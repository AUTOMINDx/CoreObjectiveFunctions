AITA for refusing to let my husband and parents meet my daughter?
My dad has always wanted a son but unfortunately for him, he got stuck with me. Honestly, I’ve made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life trying to win his love, the biggest being marrying my husband.   

When I was 6 months pregnant, I overheard a conversation between my dad and my husband where my dad was saying I couldn’t do anything right since my baby was a girl and that my husband must be so disappointed since he hadn’t held up his end of the bargain so couldn’t leave me yet. 

I decided then and there that I didn’t want my daughter to be treated the same way I was treated just because she was a girl.

I went into labour while my husband was away for business, he came back as soon as he found out but I refused to let him visit me in the hospital. I ended up going to stay with my friend for a week, which was full of my husband begging forgiveness and my parents asking to meet my daughter.

Our daughter was almost 2 weeks by the time my husband finally met her and my parents still haven’t met her despite begging me to let them.

When I finally went home my husband was so angry at me even though he tried to hide it. 

AITA?
