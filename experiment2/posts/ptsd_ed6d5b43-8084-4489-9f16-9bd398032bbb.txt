Constant nightmares and dreams
Hello everyone Im (19m) a uni student and its my first year ( aside from prep as it was online) In my country we are completely dependant on a exam which takes place on your summer break of highschool senior class (after 4 years of high school education.) So peeps usually start studying on the begining of 3rd year and bury themselves in tests and constant routine of school-library-home triangle. I wasn't really stressed out by the exam itself. I was both studying and making time to myself. But after covid hit, I had 4 months till the exam and I had to stay home rest of the time until the exam(literally didnt go out for a walk, I was that isolated.) So after 4 months of quarantine I took my exam. People usually get a relief after completing such work but I had a peculiar feeling; emptiness, depression, instability. I guess it reflected on my mental health heavily. I started having dreams and nightmares so realistic that it sometimes took me hours to realize that I was awake and the dreams were over. I didnt make much of it until one time when I opened my eyes my right hand was in punching position and I was strangling the pillow. I thought this was the line. And now Im planning to see a therapist. Im not really sure what to do though, should I wait it to get less intense or take it as a inital schizophrenia symptom. Thanks
