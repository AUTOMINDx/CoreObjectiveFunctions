Drug interaction
20M, 170lbs

So Im having cold, and Im worried if I should take this drug when Im taking Turmeric for my GERD... its called Bioflu (Phenylephrine HCI, Chlorephenamine Maleate, Paracetamol) 

Dunno if this is ok to post here but Im just not sure if theres a bad interaction here, I cant go to a doctor because if you have cough theyâ€™ll think its covid
