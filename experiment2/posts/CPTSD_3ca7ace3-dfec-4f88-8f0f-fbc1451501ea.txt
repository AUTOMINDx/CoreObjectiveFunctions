Archaic culture
I'm east African and in my culture people joke.They insult each other.They give each other  names on physical appearance.I never experienced that until today.

I was walking down the stairs today and my parents had some family friend was in the living room.The man said I was so fat I was 2 people.He comes in my house and insults me.I can't insult him because its rude.The hypocrisy and lack of self awareness is amazing.My mom says I have to take it like a man.

An instance of hypocrisy, abuse, toxic masculinity, rudeness and utmost disrespect.If I mocked him for having cancer before, I'd be the problem.I really get mad when people joke with me that I don't know.I don't have rapport with this man, and I find it rude.I find my people to be awful.

How would you guys react?
