Left my previous job on a bad note due to managers being unreasonable. I’m worried that during my job hunt, recruiters are going to ask for references from my previous workplace. How can I tell them that I left the company on a bad note without looking bad myself?
The reason I left my previous company was because they paid peanuts and made me work overtime. When I asked for a pay increase they got offended and we had an argument. I had to quit because if not I would literally be forced to sign another “slave” contract.
