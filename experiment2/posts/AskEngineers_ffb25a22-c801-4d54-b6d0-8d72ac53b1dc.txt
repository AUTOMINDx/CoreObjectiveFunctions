Which is better to employers: Studying engineering part time and finishing later but having a good amount of extracurricular involvement and side projects, or studying full time and finishing sooner but without much extracurricular involvement and side projects?
I was wondering this as I am a electrical engineering student in third year, but I am studying part time due to personal reasons. 

Right now I don't have much extracurriculars or side projects right now, but I am looking to perhaps get involved with some design teams or student unions in my university to help improve my professional profile. Since I have other personal things going on, I don't have the time to be studying full time which is why I study part time. 

Since I wont be eligible for  the co-op/internship portal in order to apply for jobs, I need advice on how to strengthen my portfolio since I will be put at a disadvantage by not applying through the portal as well as being a part time student. 

For employers, will it matter much if I am a part time electrical engineering student and not applying through the co-op/internship portal?

If so can I compensate for this by being more involved with clubs/design teams? 

If I were to study full time, but didn't get the chance to get involved with clubs/design teams with the university because of my personal commitments, would this matter much to employers?

In this case I would be getting access to the co-op/ internship portal, but without as much involvement.  

In which scenario do I have better chances for landing employment as an intern?
