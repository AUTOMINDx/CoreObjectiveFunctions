My crush might have a new admirer, and I might have competition now. What do I do!?
Alright, so here's my backstory:

• We met in January in a virtual therapy group

• We met when I was in 11th and she was in 12th

• At first we lived 30 minutes away from each other

• She recently moved an extra hour away to dorm as a college freshman

• We were supposed to have our first date in September, the day before she moved to dorm. Everything was set, but my dumbass overslept and missed it and felt terrible. However, she was very forgiving about it.

• We have never met in person but often text and video call

• Our actual first date is in a few weeks

• She's always busy with college so we don't talk as much as we used to. Even when we do, it's only surface level and we never talk about personal topics because I'm shy.

My (18m) friend and crush (18f) that I met in January this year started dorming for her first year of college, so I can only see her on breaks when she returns to her hometown. She met a new best friend in college, let's call him J, who she told me talks to her, just the two of them in her dorm, for hours. Also, when she returned home for Thanksgiving (an hour away from her college) she got him to come along and meet her family and attend her small party. From what other people told me, one of them might have something for the other, and even if I really have nothing to worry about, just in case, literally what can I do to make sure I can still have a shot?? I'm feeling so stuck. I still believe I can get my good ending, but I'm struggling to find any ideas.
