WIBTA if I ask my friend to pay his own bill as he is always making sarcastic remarks about my salary
So I have this friends group from my school time. We meet twice every month and typically have lunch or dinner. The group has everyone from surgeons, tech executives (me) to teachers and retail workers. And it has never been an issue, but I have been noticing some resentment on the part of one of our friends for the past 4 meetings I think. Now its no secret that the lockdown has been very lucrative for anyone with a tech background, I changed jobs with a 150% raise and also made a good amount of money trading, both stocks and crypto. Anyways, the bill for these get together is either taken care of by me, our surgeon friend, one more tech guy friend or an entrepreneur friend(we work it out one day before our meetup). It usually costs $1000-1200 per lunch/dinner. It has frankly never been an issue, but for the past 2 months I have been noticing one of our good friends who works in retail has been making very sarcastic comments about my salary, ever since I overshared that I received a sizeable amount of bonus from my firm. Ever since then he has been making very sarcastic comments about me, like how I should be paying all the bills from now on, and calling your highness, making fun of my wardrobe (when I told everyone I got a new watch worth $8000 he immediately said you are lying its worth 80k) and a lot more comments. 

And its frankly irritating me. The next meetup is lunch tomorrow and its my turn to pay, so I am thinking of asking him to pay his own bill if he has an issue with how much I earn. Shall I go for it?
