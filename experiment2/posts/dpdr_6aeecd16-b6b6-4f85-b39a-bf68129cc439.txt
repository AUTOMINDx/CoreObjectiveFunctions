24/7 feeling of deja vu
Hello community,

I feel like I am kind of trapped in a memory. I suffer from a constant feeling of deja vu. As if deja vu feeling in itself was not uncomfortable enough, in addition to that, I have the feeling that I can "predict the future" - and my predictions are nearly always catastrophic. Predicting is a misleading term here - it is more like I am remembering the future. What I predict has already happened "in another life", which now I am forced to "re-live".

My predictions almost NEVER turn out the way I predict them. Sometimes this gives me comfort and some locus of control. But shortly after a new deja vu feeling occurs and again I get a hunch that something bad will happen. I feel like I have no control over my life and am forced to follow this character that apparently is myself. I feel like I am forced to witness everything this characters has to go through in its biography.

Can anyone relate?
