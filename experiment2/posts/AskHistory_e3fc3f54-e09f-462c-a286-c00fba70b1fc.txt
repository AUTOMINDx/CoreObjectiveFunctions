What’s the best way to build a fairly complete overview of WWII?
I’m looking for documentaries/ books/ etc as I’m new to studying history and I realized I don’t know nearly as much about the non American pop culture side of things as I should. I’d prefer series/ movies/ books that accurately cover a broad overview of the what and why so I can then decide what specific events I want to focus on in more detail.
