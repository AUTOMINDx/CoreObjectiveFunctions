Is there a systematic hierarchy between cardinal virtues and secondary?
There's a boatload of virtues but only 4 (or 7) cardinal virtues. Part of me wants to put the secondary virtues into an organized structure with the primaries showing dependencies.

Ex: Courage could be a container for Resilience, Endurance, Confidence. Justice could be a container for Fairness, Cooperation, Gentleness. 

 Has anyone ever shared a full model of virtue relationships?   FWIW, I'm mostly interested in Stoic virtue ethics but still eager to hear how other systems make sense of it.
