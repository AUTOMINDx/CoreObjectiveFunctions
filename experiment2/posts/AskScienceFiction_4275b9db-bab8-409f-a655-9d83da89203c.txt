[DCAU]In Batman The Animated Series (and New Adventures) why doesn’t Batman use a better made Batsuit?
Huge fan of Batman The Animated Series and one of the reasons why I like it so much is because Batman isn’t a BatGod or have an iron man suit. 

That being said I always did find it odd that Batman didn’t use a better made Batsuit for a few reasons:

- The suit is always taking damage. Numerous episodes we see the suit get shredded in a fight or from a trap. While Bruce is a billionaire and probably doesn’t mind replacing them I would think it’s still a pain. Plus having villains see him fight in a torn suit may make him not look as terrifying.

-Suit doesnt offer any protection. With having no armor Batman is more likely to get hurt. Numerous episodes we see him get knocked out from a fight or he’s hurt. Having a suit with more padding would probably help himself not get as hurt as much.

As for other details:
-Batbelt is always taken away when he’s trapped. A better made suit could probably have better attachments to for the belt.

-His batsuit makes his identity being revealed much easier. As said earlier the suit rips easily and he gets knocked out from fights easily. While I don’t think anyone did it in the serious numerous villains could have probably taken the mask to see who it was since he’s unconscious so many times 

As I said I’m happy he doesn’t have a crazy suit that does a million things for him but the concept of his suit seems silly. I feel like a middle ground would be the captain America suit in the mcu.

Thoughts?
