Dynamics problem
Our teacher missed three days straight, meaning he just posted the notes and said do the questions. The supplies were clueless and no help. I don’t have a good understanding on tension, the topic he said to teach ourselves today. I don’t get this question. I know a bit of the tension concept but can’t seem to fully grasp it. Question: an old rope can now only safely suspend 120 kg when the rope is tied to a beam. it hangs down with a vertical length of 12.0 m. calculate the minimum time required for an 85 kg person starting from rest to climb the entire length of the rope without breaking it. I’ve got to the max. Magnitude the rope can hold, 1176N.
