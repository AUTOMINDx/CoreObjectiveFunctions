There’s so much sadness behind my anxiety that no one knows about and it hurts
I wish people who saw me as the bright, somewhat extroverted, bubbly, diligent, talkative person also knew about this version of me: 

The person who struggles with anxiety, who second-guesses and overthinks everything, who deals with so much negative self-talk that he wants to cry himself to sleep almost  every night, who struggles with bad panic attacks almost regularly, and who feels alone and like a burden to everyone. 

I hate that I feel this way about myself. I know I’m better than my anxiety, but dealing with so much constant negative self-talk makes me want to die because I’m constantly anxious. Not that I’m legit suicidal, but you get the point. It hurts so bad almost every day. I want to be held tight by someone and cry my eyes out.
