What do terrorist org like taliban and isis really want, what's their end goal?
from what i think: i do know that they want some kinda or full sovereignty over some land(countries) eg afghanistan, syria, iraq. But it cant really be their end goal(even if they get total control over the specific area, they are not going to be like "now we wont be bombing anywhere else, our job is done, the world has given us what we want, we wont disturb u- u dont disturb us")

cos if it was the case then there was a simple solution to this: ask every citizen of the specific area to leave that nation if they want dont want to spend  their rest of life under terrorist org(i heard a lot of afghans didnt really object to taliban when they took over control)

i know that this would create a fiasco and a lot of trouble(refugee prob and stuff) but wouln't it be better than always living under this constant threat of some or the other terrorist attacks.

**Disclaimer** : this is just a question, i really just want to know, not trying to spread any misinformation/islamophobia etc. i am sorry if it hurts anyone anyway.
