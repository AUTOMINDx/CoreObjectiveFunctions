My Grandfathers situation
My 85 year old grandfather was hit by a car about 2 weeks ago, he has broken 4 ribs and an arm due to the accident and is still in the hospital. Prior to the accident he was already anemic, but now his hemoglobin levels have dropped way down to levels of 6.6-7.4 is this something I should be worried about (because I am), I’m asking tbis here because the doctors and nurses at the hospital he’s staying at aren’t the best at answering my questions.
