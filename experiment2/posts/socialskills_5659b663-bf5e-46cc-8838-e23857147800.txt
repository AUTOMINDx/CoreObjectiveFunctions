Where do I even begin?
For as long as I remember, I never really truly felt I belonged. Everyone always treated me like a psychotic schizo and everyone always tried to avoid me and to be honest, they are not wrong for treating me like that! Although, in the past couple of years, this did get better, however after quarantine, I have lost almost all of my built-up social skills! I'm completely socially inept, I have no idea how to talk to people. I have lost all of my friends. I have become so much more socially awkward. How do people integrate into society? How do they even have friends? I have never felt more disconnected from humanity more than right now! I feel like a total fucking ghoul! I don't even feel like a person anymore! I just want to have someone! Anyone to support me and to talk to! One person would be so much infinitesimally better than zero!
