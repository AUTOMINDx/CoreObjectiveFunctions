[OH] Am I obligated to report my friend to HR if I don't work with her?
I work as a pharmacy tech in a hospital.
My friend is a nurse in a different hospital and company.
She just told me that she had sex with her coworker in their break room. 

I asked her all the friend type questions that came to me.
Are there cameras in the break room? Are you sure?
Did you lock the door?
Are you okay?

It's just now hitting me that I may have an obligation to report this, even though I don't work there.

Do I? And what should I do? 
Jeopardizing our friendship over this makes me feel icky.

Thanks,
R.
