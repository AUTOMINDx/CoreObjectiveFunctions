I was encouraged NOT to speak much. Nmom would tell people I was shy and cut me off mid-sentence while I was talking
Growing up nmom told everyone in the family "She's shy." but when I would speak to people she would either "shush" me, give me a dirty look, or even grab the phone out of my hand while talking to relatives. 

It was like she wanted a shy child and anything I did that went against that narrative was discouraged.

Another thing I believe played a role is how socially awkward I am. I felt like she didn't want me to talk out of fear I'd say something weird and embarrass her.

I basically only spoke in public when I was spoken to and any other time was discouraged.
