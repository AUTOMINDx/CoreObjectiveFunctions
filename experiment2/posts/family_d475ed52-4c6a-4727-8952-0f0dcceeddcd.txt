Does religion cloud your thinking?
So my uncle is cheating on his wife with multiple women and I suggested that his wife (my aunt) should divorce him but my brother says that polygamy is better than divorce and the reason is because divorcing is something which God doesnâ€™t like (Islam). My brother is acc well educated yet he time and time again spews some BS like this. What do you guys think?
