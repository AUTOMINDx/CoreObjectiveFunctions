Is quitting college now a bad idea?
I've been struggling since i began college and I'm now in my second and final year of a childcare level 3 btec at age 17. I just dont want to be here, I can't switch to a new course without debt or student loan debt and my college have had to pull so many strings to even keep me here (bad mental health due to undiagnosed likely ADHD)

The course says I need another 100 hours working with babies and all of the coursework but have said I can move the work to after the coursework or to do halfdays rather than full days but after 2 bad experiences in placement and being labelled a safeguarding risk for a breakdown after class where I mentioned not wanting to live anymore, i just don't feel like going back to any placement at all

I have a job at a local pub working as kitchen staff and was planning on getting a job in a warehouse or supermarket maybe if I leave college as i want to do nights since that makes more sense for my sleep schedule, I dont know what i want to do as a career and I know it isn't with children so I'm currently just struggling

My parents want me to stay but it's still "my choice" and I just don't know what to do 
I'm in the UK for reference
