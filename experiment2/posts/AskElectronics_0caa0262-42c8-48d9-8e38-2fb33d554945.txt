Hi all,

For a research project I need to connect wires to the two rows of 3 pins on this accelerometer evaluation board:[https://www.mouser.com/new/analog-devices/adi-adxl1003z-evaluation-board/](https://www.mouser.com/new/analog-devices/adi-adxl1003z-evaluation-board/)

I can't seem to find the specs on the pins, but they might be spaced by 0.1". Ideally I'd like a connector that had 3 female sockets on one side and a place to solder or crimp wires on the other side. If I had to connect each wire individually onto a pin that would be OK too.

Could someone point me in the right direction?

EDIT:  I'm not sure about the pitch since I don't have the board yet.  it would be enough to know what it is called so I can search catalogs for it.
