Girl I don't know keeps taking pictures of me, need help please
Reposting because I did not provide enough information .   


 

They keep taking pictures of me and then try to hide it, they usually do it in the middle of class or when I'm doing my classwork. I tried to look up advice and it said that they "liked" me but for sure that's not the case, because I don't know them, and I don't really have that many friends so why is she doing this?? Don't even know their name. How can I confront them? I would do the usual polite "Hey, can you stop taking pictures of me" but I feel like they would avoid/dodge that and make fun of me, which I think they're doing. My plan is to just walk near her and just take a picture of her and tell her to stop if she confronts me and tells me to delete it. How do I handle this? And there's another plan where I could go to my local counselor and report the student by getting evidence. And no I'm not paranoid, they've been doing this for 2 weeks... I am 16 and they are 17.   


TLDR: Girl keeps taking pictures of me in class for 2 weeks continuously and I don't know how to confront the problem
