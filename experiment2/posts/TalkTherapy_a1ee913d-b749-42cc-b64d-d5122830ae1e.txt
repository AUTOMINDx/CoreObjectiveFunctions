Finding the Right Therapist
Hello, I have some questions about therapy, I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I’m just scared and feel vulnerable talking to friends about stuff like this. I just kinda don’t know where to start looking, what should I look for in finding a therapist? I feel like whenever I look it’s just blindly looking at different people or places with nothing to go on. Also this sounds weird kinda but I don’t know if I can trust a therapist, I’m scared. I feel like I can’t trust anyone, and I feel worried, but don’t know why. Im sorry if this is not the right place to ask, I just want to find help because I really need it and can’t just push this off again and again anymore.
Thank you for even reading, and if you have and advice, it would be very appreciated.
