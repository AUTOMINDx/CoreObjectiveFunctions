Am I overreacting?
Okay so I recently decided to get with my ex boyfriend . I gave him the benefit of the doubt I really though he changed. He basically love bombed me. And honestly he fooled me because in the beginning it was great and then all of the sudden now I'm in hell. I love him. But he always flips scenarios and he blames me everything.  I will wake up a optimist and he will flip it and either press my buttons. And then he will make every day my problem. I've been depressed . And he just tells me I'm crazy and I need to take my meds.
