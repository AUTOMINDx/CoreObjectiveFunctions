Linguistics is a discipline of anthropology but supervisor wants an anthropologist's work for the topic of lexical borrowing.
Ok so i kind of feel dumb while posting it but, I'm a student of anthropology and in my university it's compulsory to do a thesis. I've chosen to do mine on lexical borrowing but I'm kind of lost because I did find tons of relevant work and made research questions but my supervisor asked me to find work of anthropologists on lexical borrowing. Not just linguistics but lexical borrowing. I've been reading books and articles on the topic but I haven't come across work of an anthropologist in particular on lexical borrowing... Any help or any idea where I can find the work? I know linguistics is a Field of anthropology but my supervisor specifically wants the work of an anthropologist to be included in literature review. 
Ps. I haven't submitted the synopsis yet because of the issues. I don't know how it works in other countries, but here, anthropology is quite rare and social sciences in general are not common, so I can't really ask someone here. I'm quite confused
