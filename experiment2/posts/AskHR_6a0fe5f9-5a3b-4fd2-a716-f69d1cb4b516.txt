[CA] Start-up- Travel expenses/per diem for over sea trip for a month
We need to send one FT employee to one country in Asia for a month to support the oversea team.  The company will surely pay for his airfare.  For lodging, he wants to stay at his parents house.  The oversea office will provide him a daily lunch.  What else does the employer need to pay him during his stay?  If it's a short term visit then the company will need to pay for his hotel, transportation and daily meals. Please advise.
