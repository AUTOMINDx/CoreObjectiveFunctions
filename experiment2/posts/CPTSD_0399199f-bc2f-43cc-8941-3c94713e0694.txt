Did Anyone Else Not Realize They Had PTSD?
I never experienced the typical flashbacks described, and while I knew I had mental health issues, I had always been skeptical of having had PTSD. I wasn’t terribly surprised when I had finally been diagnosed with it, and it helped me explain a lot of my behaviors. I didn’t even realize how many avoidant behaviors I had. I didn’t realize that I had a lot of emotional flashbacks, which up until that point I was convinced were some weird panic attacks or mood swings. Although my formal diagnosis was that of PTSD, I suppose CPTSD would be more accurate because I’ve struggled with a lot of traumatic experiences growing up, from illness to death to family trauma to witnessing violence, screaming, yelling, to online abuse to be stalked and bullied in middle school to being emotionally neglected, verbally, mentally and emotionally abused by family. Despite all that, I though that to qualify for any form of PTSD I had to experience traumatic memories as though they were a VR simulation, and even though I knew I had a lot of issues with my mental health I just didn’t even know I could suffer from PTSD if I didn’t experience it that way. Was anyone else somewhat surprised by their diagnosis?
