Cloud chamber Question
Hello AskPhysics,
I am currently working on building a cloud chamber with a few of my friends. Iâ€™ve been very excited to get this off the ground and have been talking to a lot of people about it. The other day, I talked to someone who had done a cloud chamber but had struggled to find an element radioactive enough for it to work. Right now I plan on using a piece of a plate from the 1950s which has uranium in it. Has anyone successfully done a cloud chamber before? If so, what did you use as your radioactive element?

Thank you!
