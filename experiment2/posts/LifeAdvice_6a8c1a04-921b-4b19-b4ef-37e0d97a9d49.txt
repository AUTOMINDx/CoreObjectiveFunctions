Am I the a-hole for telling my friend's parents that she might have been exposed to covid?
So I (16-year-old female) and my friend (17-year-old female we will call her M) have been friends for 5 to 6 years, I've only met her family around 5 times. Before covid started her parents took her out of school refusing to let her go back no matter how much she asked. So after a year and a half of being out of school, her parents finally let her come back at the begging of 11th grade. The start of the year was fine, I wore my mask all of the time due to my brother who is high risk for covid, but she on the other hand didn't. Probably a week after schools started one of our close friends texted me telling me to tell M that we may have been exposed to covid because she tested positive for it. I was freaking out because I was in a scholarship meeting and this caused me to leave early, M was at work so when I texted her she didn't see the message, and since I didn't want her to affect anyone at her work place, so I texted her parents explaining to them the situation, and they asked me if she had been wearing her mask, and I answered truthfully and told them "no she hasn't" and so the next day her parents unrolled her from school. I had no clue they would have done this. Now, this was months ago, and during my softball practice she texted me about how I ruined her school life and it was all my fault. I was just trying to be a good friend and look after her and her family, (her dad is also high risk) and yet she blames me for ruining her high school experience. Am I the a-hole?
