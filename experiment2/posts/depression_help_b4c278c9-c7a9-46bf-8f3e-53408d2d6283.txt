I need advice I can never seem to get over people from my past
I literally don't know what it is. People tell me to get over them but it's so hard when I think about them so much and it makes literally no sense, I do my best to try and get over these people who have left me in the dust especially when I needed them the most. I just need advice. I've been trying to get back into art and it's hard but it helps it does. I work alot and sometimes that doesn't help. At night it's so much worse and I absolutely hate it because those people don't think about me but yet here I am wasting my thought on them. I hope someone can help because I seriously need it.
