Has anyone else bought equipment to monitor their health (due to health anxiety)
I have bought a blood glucose meter (with strips and lancets), a blood pressure cuff, and a pulse oximeter. 

Honesty I don’t regret it, because my panic attacks mimic low blood pressure/sugar and low oxygen, and now its much easier to convince myself that I don’t need to go to the ER. So buying this stuff has probably saved me money. 

I still feel pretty embarrassed about it. I look like such a hypochondriac… and I am.
