[LOTR] Why wasn't Rohan a province of Éothéod in Rhovanion?
Rohan was given as a gift from Gondor to people from Éothéod who came to help Gondor during war. Why wouldn't Rohan be added to the Kingdom of Éothéod instead of becoming a separate country? Something like how Alaska is part of the USA, East and West Pakistan, or the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
