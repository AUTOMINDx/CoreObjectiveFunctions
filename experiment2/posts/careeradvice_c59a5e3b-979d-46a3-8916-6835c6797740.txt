Advice on finding a job in different location in advance (college grad)
So a little bit of backstory, I'll be graduating in May of 2022 with a bachelor's degree in business management, minoring in entrepreneurship. Then will be getting married in June, and moving 2.5 hours to Birmingham, AL area (fiance loves her nursing job). I currently work part-time at Walmart between classes/studying for spending/gas money, putting everything else into savings. 

Long-term, I'd like to go full-time into photographing weddings (done 4 weddings, pays well, I love it, etc.) on the weekends and running a small scale lawn care business on the side during a couple of weekdays. 

As for short-term, I would like to possibly have a "steady" job lined up after graduation related to my degree, to have some sort of steady income as I grow the weddings and lawn care from side-hustle into full-time. I will be working on starting the lawn care business and getting more weddings booked over this spring, but would like to have a safety buffer as being newlyweds in a new location to reduce financial strains, although we "could" live off of only her income if worst case happens. 

The issue is, I'm not really sure where/when to start as far as applying. The area I will be moving to is 2.5 hours away, and I won't be able to start working for another 7-8 months. Opinions?
