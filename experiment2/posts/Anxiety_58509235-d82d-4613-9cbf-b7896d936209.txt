Finally starting meds
I had an appointment today and saw a RN that talked to me and listened to me talk about everything that happened the past couple weeks. She was so nice to me and decided to follow me through this step in my life that isn’t going well. I told her I can’t see a psychotherapist because it’s too expensive, so she’s having me see a social worker which will be free in the clinic. Im starting zoloft today. She thinks I have an adaptation problem that is causing extreme anxiety. I really hope that the social worker, the medication and the nurse will be a good starter pack to getting myself back. I’ve been the worst version of myself, just extremely negative and irritable. Just wanted to talk about it somewhere
