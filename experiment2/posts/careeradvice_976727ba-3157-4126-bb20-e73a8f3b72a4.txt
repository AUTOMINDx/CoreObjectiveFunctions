Starting new role, and have Imposter syndrome?
Took a year off of work and am starting a new role as an Industrial Engineer level 2 at a logistics company. I applied for the Industrial engineer level 1 position but based on my experience, they gave me level 2. I was happy but also made me nervous because I feel they make expect more out of me even if I know nothing in the new role. I feel like an imposter almost. All the interview questions had to do with related experience and nothing really on the responsibilities of the task for the new role. This will be my second real job so i guess I am just nervous? I'm sure they will teach me but just wanted to know if anyone else feel this way about taking on new jobs that they have limited experience in?
