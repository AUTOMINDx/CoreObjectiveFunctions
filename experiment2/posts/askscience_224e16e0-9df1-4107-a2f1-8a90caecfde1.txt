Why in some pictures the sun looks brighter the closer to the edges?
I was looking this picture https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/r5vmjv/yesterday_i_took_a_300_megapixel_photo_of_our_sun/ and noticed that the color of the sun's surface looks whiter on the edges.

I'm assuming the sun has roughly the same surface temperature so this could be an optical effect.

Even NASA's SOHO pictures confirms the rough uniformity of surface color

So what is happening here ?
