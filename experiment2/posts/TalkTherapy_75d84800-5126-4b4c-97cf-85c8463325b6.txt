Questions about Residential Treatment Centers
Hi all ðŸ˜Š I have complex PTSD and although Iâ€™m faaaairly stable at the moment, Iâ€™m still struggling a lot with flashbacks, insomnia and other issues. I talked to my therapist about the idea of going to an intensive outpatient program, but it turns out that apparently Iâ€™d have to take time off of work either way? 

So I guess, if any of you have experience with an IOP, or a residential treatment program, Iâ€™d like to know about it. 

Itâ€™s okay to DM me if youâ€™d prefer, canâ€™t promise Iâ€™ll get around to replying but Iâ€™ll definitely read them all. Thanks in advance.
