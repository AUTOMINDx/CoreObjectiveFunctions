[OR] Do Companies Care if their Job is a Stepping Stone?
It seems like most jobs have low compensation, horrible work environments and have high turnover. Do companies note this and does something about it? Or do they just disregard it? I'm thinking that the ones who do this will end up making their jobs become stepping stones, to gain experence and knowledge.
