Creative person working in finance/insurance
So I recently graduated uni. I studied finance and even back then I had my doubts about whether it was right for me, but I stuck with it. I'm currently working in insurance. The job isn't bad, it's just not particularly interesting to me. I'm someone who is naturally drawn to the arts, I like to build and create, and I love fashion and painting. I'm still young so I know that if I decide that I want to do something else, I can, but my dilemma is that I like the financial security I get from the field I'm currently in. I currently find myself feeling confused and kind of bummed out because I feel like I've spent all this time developing in an area I don't enjoy, and anything that would be more interesting to me is out of reach or wouldn't provide me with the financial security I desire. Have you ever found yourself in a similar situation, if so, what did you do? Any words of wisdom are welcome.
