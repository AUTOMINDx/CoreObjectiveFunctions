Which career is more lucrative, teaching versus professors?
I'm an aspiring teacher who is going to enroll in an alternate certification program that would train me, provide a living stipend, a teacher's salary, and a subsidized master's program. I'll be teaching in New York City public schools. However, having gone down this path, or about to start it, I got into the rabbit hole of ph.D's. 

For all my life, I had been under the assumption that education is an investment and that it wouldn't be funded, you'd have to find the money, and therefore, it was a relic only established for those with money. I come from a family where we were dirt poor growing up, and I have fallen in love with teaching, or let's say, education as a field. I would not mind teaching college students at all. 

Which field would be more financially stable? Being a professor would require a ph.D but it sounds like they'll fund it based on the program.

Plus, I hate to ask about money, but which career would provide a higher compensation?

  
Being a k-12 teacher, or as a professor?
