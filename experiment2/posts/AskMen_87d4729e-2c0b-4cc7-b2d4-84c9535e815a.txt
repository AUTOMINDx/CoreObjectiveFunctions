Fellow men, how do you shop?
Me: 

Step 1: Decide what I want to buy.

Step 2: Walk into the store. 

Step 3: Eliminate everything I definitely won't be buying in 5 minutes. 

Step 4: Eliminate everything I won't buy from whatever's left. 

Step 5: At this point there isn't really anything left so I pick whatever I haven't crossed out. 

Total time taken: 7 minutes. 9 if I'm particularly interested.
