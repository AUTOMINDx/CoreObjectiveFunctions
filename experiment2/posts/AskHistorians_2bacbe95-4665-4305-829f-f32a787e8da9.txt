When I googled the phrase "great awakening" I get a wikipedia entry about several periods of religious revivalism in the USA. What happened to the people who got caught up in the fervor during those or similar times?
Of course, I am curious about this in relation to the modern QAnon movement, and wondering if there is/was historical precedent in terms of something analogous. Not trying to discuss current events here in this sub; rather, I would like to learn about the past in order to consider what might happen in the future, history having a tendency to repeat itself and all.
