When was your earliest memory of dpdr?
For me I was a small kid, and I was laying out on the front lawn and then I realized I’m an actual human being, and it felt so good to feel grounded in myself, and then I remember trying to get that feeling again, but not knowing how to get it, like I had to focus on one thing because I was focusing on that thing when I felt good. Man this is some deep layers of unpacking I’m doing right now, that I didn’t know I think I could do. Lol.
