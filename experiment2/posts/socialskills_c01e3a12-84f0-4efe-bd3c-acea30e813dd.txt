The Beige Wall Theory
I prefer to exist, without actually existing. To dutifully nod my head as I stretch out a smile to the person standing in front of me, but not campaign with these very lips to sound what I truly feel and think. 

With time and one too many unkind experiences, I find that mimicking the beige wall in front of me, to just and only exist, to be a shadow of life and being, is an ideal modus operandi. To temper my accomplishments or skills so that I would not appear as though I am in over my head. To not pronounce a single thought or emotion lest it be subject to contempt or be misconstrued and backfire. To be the one to extend my arm to others but bite my tongue before thinking to request an arm, or two if I am feeling a bit greedy, myself. 

Naturally, this has affected my interpretation of people and relationships. I am becoming increasingly withdrawn and invisible. I do not like to be seen or heard. I do not want to be a burden, an item of condemnation, and I do not care for the burdens of relationships despite being in need of them.

If upon reading this you found these words to be eerily familiar, then it is possible you are a paragon of the beige wall theory. How you decide to challenge or perhaps embrace this reality is something I would like to learn. Any advice the reader might have for a beige wall, which by no means is intended as a pejorative but, rather, a less diagnostic term, is also welcomed in the commentary section.
