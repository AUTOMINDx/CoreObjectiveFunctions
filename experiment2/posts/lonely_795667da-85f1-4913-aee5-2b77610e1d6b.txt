is it my fault?
i just lost my two closest and only friends. i sent them a long paragraph finally opening up and explaining how i felt underappreciated and like i wasn't really /their/ friend. we'd been friends for four years and i'd done a lot to maintain such empty friendships. i first started even thinking of telling them my feelinggs because they'd forgotten my birthday again, just like the last two years. and they'd claimed to have seem my stories and posts where i talked abt how lonely i felt on my birthday and how i wished my "friends" could send me a quick message or anything really. i went into detail abt how i felt pitied, used, and meaningless to them. one had responded telling me i deserved it, they felt i was doing the same and that i was a "petty bitch". the other said they "genuinely" did not know it was my birthday and they saw my posts and stories only because they were skipping through them. they both came to the conclusion (seperately) that i deserved to lose their friendship, that if i felt one way why didn't i act upon said feeling. so, is it my fault i'm all alone?
