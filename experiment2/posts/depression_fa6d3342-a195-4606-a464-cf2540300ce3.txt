If you read this then i am grateful
I can't take it anymore. Nobody loves me and nobody cares about me. It's been way too long that someone checked up on me or even had a conversation with me. I really am contemplating suicide rn and i have a knife near me. I just know nobody cares if i do it. Or i get the classic "I didnt know he was depressed/I loved him like my brother bullshit." I'm done and maybe you will hear from me tommorow. I really do not know.
