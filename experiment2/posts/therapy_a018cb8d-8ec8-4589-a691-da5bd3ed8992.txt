What to do when you are discouraged with doing something you love
I easily get discouraged when I see other people do so good in the hobbies I love. For example, I love playing instruments, filming, editing, theatre, but I am not an expert or even good at doing them. I am trying to develop a growth mindset and BELIEVE I can get better with practice, I know I can, but is it even worth the time? I just choose to focus on my job to make money but it sucks my soul, hobbies like making music and creating films make me happy and make me feel like a unique human being. But I don't have the best voice which is very discouraging and makes me not want to try anymore. 

I also don't have access to free theatre groups or filming which makes it hard to get better and learn.

Any advice?
