What to do with a B.Sc in Biopharmaceutical Science?
As the title says, I'm just finishing a B.Sc in Biopharmaceutical Science with a specialization in Genomics.

When I first started this program I had some career ideas, but over the last few years of courses I've really struggled in some aspects. I think I'll graduate with a high enough GPA to maybe enter a masters, but absolutely not enough for a Ph.D.

I'll be 32 when I finish the degree this year, and I'm trying to figure out where I can work with this degree and still make a respectable income using just the B.Sc (I'd like to start building a career). Through my searches, most jobs seem to offer minor lab roles where I'll barely break 40k if I'm lucky (and work myself to death). So far my best options look to be government positions, but even there I not quite sure how to leverage my degree.

Any advice on how to progress a career, or career suggestions are welcome. (Is there any way for me to hit 80/90k with this degree or did I choose really poorly?)

*I'm not the best with physics or chemistry, but I excelled at biology (immunology, virology, genomics)
