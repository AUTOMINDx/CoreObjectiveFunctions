I need help finding if I can trust this therapist office
Hello I’m male 16 I did a mental test during my normal check up at the doctors office they highly suggested my mother should seek to find me some therapy. I’m very much in the closet I’m a bi maybe gay. Ether way my parent is making me do online zoom therapy with “family welfare services” it’s been hard to find information but it’s owned by someone who’s part of the mormon church
