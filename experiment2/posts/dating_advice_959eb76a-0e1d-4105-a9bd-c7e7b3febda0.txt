Stopped chasing her
About 4 months ago I met a woman I fell in love with. She was always hesitant with her feelings towards me, which left me confused more often than not.
At the same time she kept telling me how comfortable she feels with me, how safe she feels, how much she likes being with me and so on. She knows I fell in love with her because I told her. We kiss a lot, have sex, go out on dates. So I though she was developing feelings too, just slower than me.

We chatted daily. Last Thursday was our last chat. I stopped chasing her, stopped being the only one to initiate, stopped asking her out. And I feel sad. My friends tell me it’s the right thing to do, to let her initiate contact for a change and suggesting a date. 

I feel the same way as my friends do. But I can’t help to think about this destroying things. On the other hand, it has to come from both ways....

I hope she will message me one of these days. My birthday is this Tuesday. She surely would say something on my birthday.
