What were the contradictions between medieval Christian thought and Aristotelianism the scholastics were trying to reconcile?
My question is motivated by trying to figure out what the big deal with Aquinas is and why he's seeing such a revival within the Catholic Church recently. I know the whole goal of scholasticism was reconciling contemporary Christian thought with new ancient Greek texts introduced by Reconquista and the influx of Islamic and Jewish thought, but I'm trying to figure out what was so problematic about the interaction between those philosophies, why Aquinas was so controversial even in his own time, and why the Catholic Church seems to be so fixated on him specifically. I'm admittedly not very familiar with either ancient or medieval philosophy so that's probably where the confusion stems from.
