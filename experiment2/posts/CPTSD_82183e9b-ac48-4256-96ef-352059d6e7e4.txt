Does anyone feel frustrated that it doesn’t seem like anyone around them unstable what your going through.
My mom died two weeks ago and I’m frustrated with my friends. Not that there being mean but more that none of them have lost a person before so are unintentionally insensitive.

I really miss my mom. She the person I used to always go to with these feelings but she gone so I’m here.
