Therapy: How do I differentiate between important events and minor nuisances when everything seems important to me?
I've recently started therapy because I've been dealing with depression, anxiety and subsequent panic attacks pretty much my whole life and I started to get bad again. 

During my last session she mentioned she'd been thinking about what I had told her and that she had started to get a bad feeling that I might have had people in my life that crossed boundaries they shouldn't have (which is true). 

So while I set the record clear that I had never technically been raped, there were people that had crossed boundaries they shouldn't have. 

So my question is, what is relevant? There were many many minor instances where I felt like I couldn't uphold my boundaries and people crossed them with no regard to me. How do I select the ones that might actually help me deal with the overlying issue? 
I mean I can't tell her to pick a year and then tell her about instances in that year. I don't want to get stuck on the small stuff and waste my time.
