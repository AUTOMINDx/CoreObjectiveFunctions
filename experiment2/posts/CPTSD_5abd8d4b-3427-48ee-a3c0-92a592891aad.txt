I did it
If you look at some of my previous posts you'll get a broad picture of my father (there's really not much there but it gives you an idea)


This time it was my birthday when he messaged "I miss Hannelie so much ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­" (At age 16 my sister died in a freak car accident, she was a pedestrian on the sidewalk)


That was his birthday message to me.


It's taken me 3 days since to process exactly what to do with that stark reminder of my worth to him. It was never about me; his golden child was Hannelie - and even she got abused, just not as badly as I did.


So tonight I messaged:


"And I missed out on having had a loving father who cared for his children when I was a little girl.
We suffered brutal abuse.
And neglect: medically, emotionally and financially.


I'm a parent too; I see what you've done.
I see you."


30 seconds later the phone started ringing. I messaged "please don't contact me again". 


And then I blocked him.
