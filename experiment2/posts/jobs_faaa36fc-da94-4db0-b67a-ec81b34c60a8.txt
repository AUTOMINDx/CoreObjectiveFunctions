19 Year old with no path
&amp;#x200B;

This last fall I graduated and got my high school diploma, and after struggling to find anything above minimum wage I settled for a job at Walmart making $12/hour. For many reasons, mainly to do with the workplace, but also where I need to be financially to move out before I'm 20 (currently 19).

Traditional, in this case, college education I figured out isn't a thing I'm ready for. My main goal is literally just to be financially stable and able to move out and not worry about going homeless, but like anyone I desire to make more than just enough to barely get by. I'm not opposed to trades, as I may potentially go into the IBEW within the next one-to-two years. The big catcher is that I need previous work experience to higher my chances of acceptance into the apprenticeship.

In that time of anywhere between 9 months to 1 year and 9 months I'd like to begin something I could be content with as well, incase the class is potentially filled up for the next two yearly sessions

Believe me, any advice is greatly appreciated and could possibly change my life direction, which is crazy thinking about in the big picture.
