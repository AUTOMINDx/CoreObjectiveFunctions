scared when i’m on a good day
does anybody else always feel anxious or scared when they are having a good day because i know that a bad day will soon follow. The days seem really long and when i’m at my worst is when alone at home. 

I keep telling myself that I am okay but in reality I really am not, 15 years and i’m still on / off depressed…
