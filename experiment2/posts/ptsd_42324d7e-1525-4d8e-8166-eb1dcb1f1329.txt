TW/ My boyfriend sexually courses me, persuades me, sometimes it feels like his guilty tripping me into sex.
So we did have sex once w/o consent because i just tried to stop explaining him i didn’t want to but he went in anyway smoothly like coursing me into it so.
he apologized for this when i bought it up.
he still pushes after i say no.
then he’ll do a little guilt trip and i’m like don’t be like that!! i’ll feel bad i’m sorry 
and he’ll b like it’s ok eventually
he ate me out even when i said i was uncomfortable with it he still kissed me and then ate me out  and and i feel so bad like if i pull him off he’s gonna be disappointed
