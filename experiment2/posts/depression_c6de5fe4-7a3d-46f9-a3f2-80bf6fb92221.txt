I have no motivation or desire to do much of anything.
I don't want a career. I have a degree in engineering and I've had a few jobs with that in the past, as well as a bunch of other kinds of jobs I've had before those. I just hate having a job. I hate getting up early. I hate having to be somewhere and do things all day 5 days a week. I hate having responsibilities. I don't want kids because it seems like a shit ton of work, money I don't have, and responsibility/stress/worry. All I do all day is watch TV and play some video games. Even that gets old but there's really nothing else I want to do or have the energy for. I have a house I bought with some savings I had and some help from my parents. I had a job at the time but haven't had one in a couple years now and really don't want one. I've been living on the unemployment funding from the pandemic but that's ended. I could just sell the house to pay off the mortgage and come out with maybe 40 grand since housing prices have gone up. But then what, just live at my parents' house doing the same nothing but lie on the couch all day? I just feel like life is so fucking pointless and i don't want to do anything. I've dealt with severe mental illness my whole life, depression, OCD, panic disorder. I've been on virtually every psych drug there is, thousands of hours of various kinds of therapies with various therapists and psychiatrists. I even had a bunch of ECT (electroshock) treatments at Johns Hopkins. I still don't really wanna do shit but sleep all day and watch TV. What's wrong with me?
