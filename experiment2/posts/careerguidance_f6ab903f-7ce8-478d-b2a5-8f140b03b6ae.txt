Am I being an entitled millennial?
I could use some perspective/advice from my fellow redditors. I work as an Account Manager for a prop tech company in residential real estate. This means I’m basically responsible for every aspect of selling a clients home once they sign an agreement with us, from pre-listing all the way to closing, with plenty of hostile phone calls along the way. I did some investigating and realized I’m on track to close on about 30-35 homes in my first year, ranging from $200k to $850k. This all sounds great until you consider that I’m on a strict salary, and have very minimal opportunities for commission or bonuses. When you subtract the shitty healthcare from my paycheck I’m not even on track to clear $50k ($49k and some change) this year. Am I in the wrong to feel salty about this?? I feel like most real estate agents with this volume would make well in the 6 figures, and I’m struggling to pay rent lol. Just curious if my frustrations are justified bc I’m  considering jumping ship!
