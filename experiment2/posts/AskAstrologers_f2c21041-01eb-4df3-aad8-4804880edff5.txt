Neptune in Capricorn Second House
Hey everybody! I hope you are all doing great! Does anyone have any experience with Neptune in the 2nd house? I have capricorn over my second house. I've read everything I could find on neptune in the 2nd and it's all pretty negative. Does any body have experience working with this placement? Does having Saturn as my 2nd house ruler   negate any of neptune's effects?

Thanks xx
