Is there a quote or specific line in the republic, for example, when Plato said that philosophy's goal was to 'fulfill people?'
In [this article](https://fs.blog/four-reasons-why-plato-matters/), they say that Plato "devoted his life to helping people reach fulfillment \[through philosophy\]." I also remember an introductory philosophy class professor talking about how Plato viewed the ultimate goal of philosophy to help people reach fulfillment or 'enlightenment.' However, no matter how much i google "Plato the republic philosophy is fulfillment" or some variation of that, I cannot seem to find any specific quote or line where he (or someone else credible) says that.

Did he say it at all ? Did he even actually think that?
