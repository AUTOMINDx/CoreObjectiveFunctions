How has DPDR affected your sleep?
I sleep like a baby and always have a hard time getting up in the morning. It’s like my dreams feel more real than my real life, so it’s difficult to make myself get up and start my day. I’ve seen many others here who can’t/don’t like sleeping with dpdr. How do you feel about it?
