Anyone else talented + qualified but getting rejected? (creative fields)
I'm sure there are posts like this but Reddit's search has been lacking lately. Apologies anyway. 

I'm a graphic designer with 7 years of experience, mix of freelance and in-house. I'm looking for a new in-house position. I've applied to dozens of remote jobs via LinkedIn and elsewhere over the last few months, and have mostly been completely ignored. I think I've only gotten one or two interviews. This has never ever been an issue for me - I've always had recruiters reaching out, always gotten interviews and jobs - so on top of being confused, I'm also feeling like shit about myself and my abilities. 

I know this "data" is to be taken with a grain of salt but on LinkedIn, many of the remote jobs in my field show over 600 applications in a week. Most jobs receive 100+ apps in under 24 hours. 

I want to work remotely for personal/medical reasons but also because we're relocating for my husband's job in the next couple months. Is this (lack of) response due to higher competition for remote jobs? When I check jobs in other fields, the application rate is actually fairly low, so are there simply more designers in the workforce now? But not all these candidates can be high quality, right? Does that mean I'm just not stacking up? 

The messaging right now around the state of the job market is even more confusing. Supposed labor shortages but also no callbacks. Hiring managers having their pick of the litter but also apparently lack of good talent. But also high quality candidates are leaving their shitty jobs so talent IS abundant? I mean...are people hiring or not??

Anyone else in creative fields experiencing this?
