Need a change - PhD in English but leaving academia
Hi all. I've been a bit lost as I've tried to imagine a life for myself outside of grad school and academia. I'm not sure what sort of positions would be open to hiring me, and I've had a hard time getting interviews for writing/editing positions. 

Via grad school I gained experience writing, editing, researching, teaching, course management, and content management systems. I have some of experience with project management, HTML, CSS, and XML coding. For the past two years I've been working in an academic archive as digitization technician. I take high-resolution photographs of images and artifacts on very technical equipment and have become skilled in Photoshop and other AV editing software.

I taught a lot of technical writing \[often to classes of only engineering students\], and could see myself doing that or editing, but the pay seems so low and I can't seem to get interviews anywhere I apply. I currently only make $30,000 with pretty good benefits in a city where the COL is growing really quickly. Any suggestions on which directions I might look towards next are welcome! TIA
