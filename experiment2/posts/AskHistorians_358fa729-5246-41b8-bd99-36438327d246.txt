If Blitzkrieg was so effective for Germans in the beginning of WW2, why didn't they keep using it to win the war?
I have been reading Max Hasting's "All Hell Let Loose" lately, and in it, he talks a lot about how Germany's blitzkrieg tactic was so effective in France that French soldiers' morale had taken a hit and in some instances, they had accepted - much before it actually happened - that France would fall in a matter of days. 

This might sound like a stupid question, but the more I read about Blitzkrieg and its effectiveness, the more I can't seem to understand why wasn't it used by Germany throughout the war to finally win WW2?
