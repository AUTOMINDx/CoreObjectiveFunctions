How often is it okay to eat like shit?
I (18f) have been trying to lose weight and get healthy for a while. I work put 5 times a week and regulate my food as much as I can. But sometimes I eat a lot. Like A LOT. Not bingeing but like just large meals. 
Of course if I do this regularly I won't reach my goals, but I'm still young and I want to enjoy my food before it gets too late.

So like is it okay if I eat like shit once in a while and Workout? Like is it healthy ?
