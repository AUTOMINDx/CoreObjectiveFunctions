I have been noticing blood in my stool recently
16M 5’8 123lbs I don’t do drugs nor do I have any predicting medical conditions or take any medicines. 
Over the past six months I have started to become nauseous every time that I have to go to the bathroom, I can normally tell in advance by about 20 minutes when I will have to go. This has happened pretty consistently and has been an annoyance but nothing more. Then probably around  4 months ago every time that I would go to the bathroom my shit would be extremely stiff and larger than normal and burn out the way out it and it became an unconvinced to the point where I would dread going to the bathroom because I either would have to go through pain actually getting it out or I would be nauseous trying to hold it in. That went on till about a month ago when I started to see red streaks in my stool which I thought made sense because I would always wipe a little blood off and nothing else normally since it was so dry, but in the past week and a half every time I wipe the toilet paper gets soaked with blood and there is more in the toilet than what I’m used to like some is coming out with my stool also. Idk if it is a problem or not I have a pretty healthy diet and I’m in shape I just got done marching snare drum in a marching band I have been active all summer so idk really know what to do and if I should be concerned.
