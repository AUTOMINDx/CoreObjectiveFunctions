Please help… my son (4) has elevated (and flagged) potassium and creatinine levels.. what could this mean?!
Male , 4 years old, 53 pounds, 3’7 
No medications or health issues. 

My 4 year old was experiencing some bladder issues, accidents constantly and not realizing he was having them. So I took him in after a few weeks of this thinking it was a UTI or something of the sort. 

After urine came back “perfect” his dr did some blood tests. His creatinine and potassium came back super elevated. Dr was concerned but wanted to do blood again a few weeks later and while he was fasting. So here we are again.. higher creatinine and potassium. We have a referral to a nephrologist 

My questions concerns are.. what do we expect from this. Dr google doesn’t help the anxiety at all!! 

His current levels were: Creatinine (range is .20-.50) his level was .71

Potassium (range 3.5 - 4.7) his level was 6.6 

His first lab results, his BUN  was lower than range but now it is just barely in range.
