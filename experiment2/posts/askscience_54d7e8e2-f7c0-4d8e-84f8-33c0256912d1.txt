What is oobleck and what does it mean for something to be non-newtonian?
I keep on reading that it is a "non-newtonian" solid. What does non-newtonian mean exactly and how can we say that it is not liquid? Why does applying pressure to the corn starch and water mixture cause the liquid to harden? How is this able to act as it does on a molecular level?

Sorry that my questions are all jumbled up. This thing is so bizzare to me.
