How can I stop convincing myself that all my friends hate me
For the first time in a while I have a large friend group and have a lot of people that I would consider “friends”, but for around a month or so I’ve been having massive anxiety about them not liking me.

When I look back on my interactions with these people I always feel like the pity invite or as if they’re just tolerating me. Even though people invite me to do things I always feel like I’m never anyone’s first choice and that while they’re nice they don’t really give a shit about me. I know that’s a shitty thing to think but I can’t help but feel as if all these people are just being nice to me out of pity since we can’t really kick people out of this friend group (if that makes sense). Sometimes I just try to tell myself that people wouldn’t ask to do things if they didn’t like having me around but also, I don’t really text these friends (we usually just talk whenever we end up meeting up) so I end up feeling very alone a lot of the time. 

Does anyone have any tips for dealing w this bc it’s fucking me up so badly and kind of ruining the way I interact with people too.
