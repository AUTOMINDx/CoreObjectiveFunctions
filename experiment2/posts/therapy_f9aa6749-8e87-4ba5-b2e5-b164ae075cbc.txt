How do I speak my mind freely while also being considerate of other peoples feelings?
Ive recently been very pro-freedom of speech because when I was younger I bit my tongue all the time. (Because my family ALWAYS told me to shut up obviously effected me badly)

Recently I’ve been coming in the turn with talking more and expressing my feelings more. However im noticing that sometimes when I express myself I make people feel bad? 

Example: I was trying to lift a 50 pound dumbbell (completely by myself I might add) to get it out the way so my grandpa could go through., while my aunt sat in the corner barking orders on how to do it “right”. Obviously I was frustrated because I couldn’t do it  all by myself and said “ well then why don’t you come do it since you have all the answers right?” . She said she felt “disrespected”. Part of me really doesn’t care ,cause I ment what I said 100% , but my intention was not to make her feel bad I guess.

This is happened multiple times where I said something that “hurt someone’s feelings”, when I was only just expressing myself.I don’t want to CARE what they think of me (because I’m obviously trying to grow from being pretty much muted all my life) I just don’t want them to feel bad as a result of the things I say? because these are people I care about.

But I also don’t want to completely censor myself to please anyone ever again.

TL;DR How do I find the balance of not caring what people think about me but also care about their feelings? How do I express myself freely but also care about how my words affect others?
