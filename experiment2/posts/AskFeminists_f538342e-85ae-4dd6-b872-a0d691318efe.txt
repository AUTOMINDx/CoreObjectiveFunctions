What are your thoughts on this video, regarding the hypocrisy of liberal legislatures (and their voters too)? How can we get out of this deadlock from both sides?

In this,  Johnny Harris and Binya Appelbaum talk about  why famously liberal states like California and Washington struggled to advance progressive policies - even when they control the legislature (though they still manage to blame the republicans); this happens partly because of voters, but there is great reluctance of behalf of democrats themselves to put their programs into practice. 

 

So, what do you think? Is there a progressive path forward (maybe through the likes of AOC)?
