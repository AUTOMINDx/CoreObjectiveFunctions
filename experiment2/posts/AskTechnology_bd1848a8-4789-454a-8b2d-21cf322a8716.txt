Best Budget Cellphones
I currently own a Galaxy A11, but find that it really struggles with some games and apps. I was hoping I could get a recommendation for a budget phone in the $200-300 price range. I've been pretty out of touch with phone technology for the last few years, so I don't really know where to look or what companies to trust. I saw that OnePlus has the 'Nord' model in my price range and wanted to see if anyone could give some personal feedback on that particular phone. Any and all information is appreciated!
