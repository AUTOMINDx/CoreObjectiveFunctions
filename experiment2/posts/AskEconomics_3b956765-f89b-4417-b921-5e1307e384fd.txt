What is the economic impact of funerals?
Recently, I attended my first funeral of a family member. The file member in question had a history of debt, and it was a source of some concern to the executor of the will (a nephew) that he would probably have to pay at least something towards the funeral.

It got me wondering if the expense of typical funerals has any impact on generational wealth.
