Will the velocity of money go up?
If so, when? And will it necessarily lead to great inflation, since the M2 got quintupled last year, or is the jury still out on the consequences? If it won't, will it be due to the growing inequality? And would that mean redistribution of wealth could lead to catastrophic inflation?
Sorry, it's a lot of questions, hopefully you will find some interesting enough to engage with. I haven't found basically anything online, so internet economists are my one hope in getting answers.
Thanks in advance.
