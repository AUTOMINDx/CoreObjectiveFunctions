I (23F) want to move to a brand new city all by myself next summer. Aside from saving money, what things should I spend the next 6 months doing to prepare?
I’ve spent the past 23 years of my life very unhappy and unfulfilled, and I’ve decided I want to make a change. I want to move to a whole new city where none of my friends or family live, change my name, and have a complete redo on life. My target: Philadelphia.

Aside from saving up to afford an apartment and making sure I have a job secured down there, what else can I spend the next six months doing to help prepare for this?
