Felt like I was ok..
Anyone else feel like they are "OK" or that they shouldn't having the rating they do? Im 100% TDIU P&amp;T since late 2018.

Today I kind of realized I am not good at anything.  I don't work, go to school.. I just exist. I have 2 beautiful children who I take care of. But damn its difficult when they recognize that im having a bad day. It fucks me up when they ask if I "just need some space" or "just not having a great day huh?"

Really down on myself today.. just trying to figure out what my purpose is. What am I actually good at?

Thanks for reading.. yes I'm safe. Going to try and go to the gym if I can find the motivation.
