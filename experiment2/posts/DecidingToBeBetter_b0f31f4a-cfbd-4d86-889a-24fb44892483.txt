Lack of motivation due to Covid (mild depression ?)
Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I feel like I'm the only person who's still dealing with Covid stress etc and who still hasn't got their life back together haha. No matter how much I try to pretend that life is normal I always get this negative voice that says "the world and your life will never go back to normal/to the before times" and I'm like what's the point of trying... Things like trying to loose weight (I've been eating a lot of comfort food to cope), exercising and developping healthy habits etc seem even more meaningless and even less appealing than it did before... I know most of my habits right now are totally contributing to how I feel and that I would 100% feel better if I changed literally everything but I just have zero motivation or energy... It's just overwhelming. And when I do try to do better I sabotage myself every single time so it's even more like what's the point in even trying. I don't think I'm really depressed, just unmotivated and tired. Any advice ?
