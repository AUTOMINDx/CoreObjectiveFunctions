AITAH for telling my sister I will not babysit for her
Me (30f) my husband (28m) and our three kids (9m,8f,1m) are travelling almost 400 miles in January to my hometown to see my family. 

My sister knew we are coming and the dates we are coming and has booked 2 nights away with her bf (who I haven’t met yet, not her kids father) for some of the dates we are there, knowing we are going to be there. 

She called me yesterday and said to me that I will be staying at her house while She’s away so not to book the hotel for those nights. I told her I wanted to book the hotel for the entire time I was going to be there, because it was a better deal than splitting the dates, she then said she didn’t want her kids staying at the hotel. 
I got confused as to why her kids would be at the hotel and she said “because You are babysitting” 

She wants me and husband to look after our three kids and her three kids (9m,6m and 2f) for 2 nights. I’ve said no because 
1) I am disabled, I have a physical disability and once I take my nighttime meds I’m fast asleep and it’s really hard to wake me up, so husband who have to be alert for 6 children (which includes 2 toddlers and my 9 year olds autistic so might struggle overnight in the hotel to begin with) 
2) we are going to visit family not babysit and I feel like she shouldn’t just assume I’ll babysit. 
3) the two days she has chosen is the first two days we will be there which means I will be in more pain after driving 7 hrs plus to get there. 

Info: she has been with her bf for 3 months and has already moved him into her house so she gets to see him everyday. It’s not like she doesn’t get to see him. 
Her children are not disciplined and know that because I am disabled they can walk all over me.
