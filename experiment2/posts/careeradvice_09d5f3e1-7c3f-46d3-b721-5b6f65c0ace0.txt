Which Job should I choose?
I am very very fortunate after applying to over 300 jobs in the past 6 months to have been offered two jobs in two different companies. I just really don't know what to choose. Both opportunities are remote.

Company A is a medium-sized company that wants to hire me as a Data Analyst for their platform for creating, measuring, and declaring ESG impact for their clients. Company A says the Remote Data Analyst will require attendance to quarterly in-person meetings (which works out well for me, since I live near HQ). Outside of the quarterly meetings, there may be a few ad-hoc client requested meetings (2-3) a year, however, they say I will typically have plenty of preparation time.

Company B is a medium to large company and wants to hire me as a Data and Analytics Consultant. Company B is a full-service marketing agency and consultancy with large name clients. The HR Lady said she does not believe that I would have to do any traveling at all, this position should be fully remote. They offer a 4% company match, vested immediately.

**I need to make my decision by Tuesday Morning (11/30).**  


Any advice? Thank you for taking the time!
