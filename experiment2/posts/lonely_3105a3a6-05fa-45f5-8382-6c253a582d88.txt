I was finally given a pillow
My living situation isnt ideal. I live with people who i truly think hate my existence and wish i had never been born. 

A month or so ago, my favourite pillow exploded in the wash. It was its time, it was loved dearly, countless nights soaked in my tears. The case for it survived, so i just stuffed it with a spare blanket.

I shouldnt have been so attached to that pillow. But i was. It felt like i had lost a best friend or something. 

Anyways. Tonight we had a small get together. I mostly stayed quiet, was talked over or ignored completely when i tried to say something. The usual. 

Everyone leaves and i go to my room and see a new pillow just.. On my bed. Its not as comfy as my old fucked up one but idk. I feel loved for once? I have my thoughts on who it might have been. But i didnt confront them. Im just thankful i have a pillow again.
