Was this PTSD?
I was spending the weekend at my friend's house and we watched horror movies, I had no idea they would depict ||SH|| I started really hallucinating and dissociating and I think I actually passed out. The movies heavily reminded me of something that happened that was traumatizing.. I told them about how it triggered me and thankfully they understood and will be more carful nextime. 

I had no idea I had this does this sound like PTSD or something else?...I'm still very shook up and are having a very hard time getting it out of my mind..
