Would Vaseline and mineral oil have the same thermal expansion as paraffin wax?
I was looking at low melting point paraffin wax when I read that both Vaseline and mineral oil are paraffin.

If it's paraffin would the thermal expansion be the same when it goes from solid to liquid ? 

I was looking at making a wax motor and needed a low melt temperature
