Family party drama
My fiancé (m26) and I (f25) are invited to two thanksgiving/holiday parties for his mother’s side of the family. They always do the party after thanksgiving in hopes of having everyone attend. This year two of my fiancé’s cousins are pregnant. One is vaccinated per her doctors advice (let’s call her G) and the other isn’t per her doctors advice (and call her H). I’m not here to debate vaccines but it’s important for the story. My fiancé and I are vaccinated and so is his immediate family as are a majority of his relatives. The only unvaccinated are H, one aunt (let’s call her B) and a two year old. Out of a group of forty, I think that’s pretty good. So G’s mom always hosts this party and she made it a requirement that you had to be vaccinated to attend because according to G’s doctor “she should only be around vaccinated people.” (Mind you that G is a labor and delivery nurse so I don’t know how she swings that at work.) So B doesn’t like that and decides to host her own party at the same time and anyone can come regardless of vaccine status. So now there are two parties occurring at the same time and will each have around 20 people. And now we have just found out that G and her husband have decided to fly to New York City for a baby moon for a few days and is posting all of these pictures where she is in crowds without a mask and around tons of people. It feels highly hypocritical to me and my fiancé that she can go to New York and be around hundreds of strangers whose vaccination status is unknown than be around three unvaccinated people. Now my fiancé and I don’t want to go to either party as we think it’s wrong that G is in New York and we do not want to condone B’s behavior by attending her tantrum unvaxxed party. TL;DR
