Do animals commit suicide?
Kinda of a weird question I've had, I know animals can have mental problems, like elephants who struggle with PTSD, or dogs with depression, and some animals are sentient of their feelings and know that they in fact exist, but could an animal reach a level of consciousness and suffering it would kill itself?
