Nasal Decongestant Spray without Rebound?
\[24M\] Hey everyone, it's that time of the year again and seasonal allergies and colds are destroying my ability to breathe through my nose like a normal human being (I have a deviated septum so any kind of congestion RUINS me).

I have used Afrin and generics ( Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride (0.05 %)) for short term relief to help with colds and allergies but hate the rebound the next day even when used within the proper guidelines. It's like you are trading being miserable tomorrow for being able to fall asleep today.

Are there any alternatives to Afrin that provide the short term congestion relief without the horrible rebound? I don't even need an all day solution, just something that can help me get to bed at night. I have tried Sudafed but it really doesn't do much to help the nose. Thanks!
