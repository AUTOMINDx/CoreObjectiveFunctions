Where can I find a translation to English of this book in French? (Anne Dufourmantelle)
I'm interested in reading this book: *En Cas D'Amour: Psychopathologie de la vie amoreuse*, or *In Case of Love: Psychopathology of Love Life*, by French philosopher Anne Dufourmantelle.

One line in a French (translated to English) review made me interested in reading this book: "If you don't believe in the unconscious, read this book"

I can't seem to find an English translation of the book. Can anyone help me?
