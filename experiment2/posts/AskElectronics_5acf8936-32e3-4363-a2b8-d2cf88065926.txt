Variable signals and oscilloscope triggering
I have an audio signal that I want to view with my oscilloscope, and am able to do so after pressing the "Auto" button. But it seems to show the signal for a short while and then seems to re-trigger (I'm guessing) at seemingly random intervals on the order of a few seconds. The signal suddenly shifts and it makes it hard to see the continual transformation of the signal.

I'm guessing that it's triggering at different points in the (relatively) complex waveform, but I don't understand why it does the magic I want sometimes and not others. I have found that I can make it behave "better" by raising the trigger point, but when the wave's amplitude decays below that point, it goes back to misbehaving.

It seems like there should be a way to tell the scope to find the appropriate sampling frequency (I'm sure that this is not the correct term) and stay there until I say otherwise, but I'm new enough at this that I don't know if I don't know how to configure my scope properly, if my scope doesn't have this capability, or if no scope has this capability.

Assuming it's a trigger problem, the options I see are AC vs DC Coupling, Auto/Normal/Single, Rising vs Falling Edge, and Trigger Level. There may be more I'm missing.

The scope in question is the [Owon HDS272S](https://www.owon.com.hk/products_owon_hds200_series_digital_oscilloscope). ([User manual](http://files.owon.com.cn/probook/HDS200_series_user_manual.pdf).) I'm aware that this is not a high-end scope, but, again, I don't know if my expectation is unreasonable, and, if so, how unreasonable.
