Was Patrice Lumumba's assassination a success?
I'm interested in learning more about the aftermath of Lumumba's assassination in the Congo, and am having trouble finding sources.  What was the political aftermath of the killing? Did the Belgians and US achieve the political goals they saw Lumumba as a barrier to? Was the assassination considered a political gain for the West?
