Is there a good complete documentary on Jeffery Epstein?
I actually feel embarrassed to Admit I still have zero idea what’s going on here it’s not for lack of trying 

I have a hard time reading the extensive timelines on the case I’m autistic and have an incredibly hard time with names so often get lost when they mention people just in writing 

I have looked at video but so many videos se to just have bits and pieces of information I want a complete work up from start to as close to now as possible 

Does anyone have any ideas
