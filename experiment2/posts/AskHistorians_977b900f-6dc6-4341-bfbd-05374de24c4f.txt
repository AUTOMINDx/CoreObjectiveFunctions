Did Mexico attack Texas during the US civil war?
According to this site they did. https://www.britannica.com/place/Texas-state/Annexation-and-statehood

The only thing I don’t understand about that is, I thought USA and Mexico had a treaty after the Mexican-American war? The Guadalupe Hidalgo treaty.

I believe USA even helped defend Mexico in the French-Mexican war, and the war was ended in 1867 because the French wanted no part of conflict with the US of A. (USA’s military rebounded in 1867 a bit, and US warned France to leave Mexico.)

Anyways, below is a pic of where the site mentions Mexicans attacking Texas during the civil war. Just curious about how that went about, with there being the Treaty of Hidalgo..
