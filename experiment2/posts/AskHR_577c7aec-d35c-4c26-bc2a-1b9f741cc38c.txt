[NJ] is it unusual for a company to convert from upfront PTO to accrued PTO?
I see many jobs have converted to either unlimited PTO or just more flexibility in general. 

So how unusual is it for a company to change from giving PTO upfront at the start of the year to employees have to accrue it? 

And what is the reasoning behind it?
