What happened to the first kamikaze?
The kamikaze Wikipedia reads:

&gt; One source claims that the first *kamikaze* mission occurred on 13 September 1944. . .First Lieutenant Takeshi Kosai and a sergeant were selected. Two 100 kg (220 lb) bombs were attached to two fighters, and the pilots took off before dawn, planning to crash into carriers. They never returned, but there is no record of a Kamikaze hitting an Allied ship that day. 

The article makes it sound they just disappeared. What happened to them? Or, if that question is unanswerable, what *might* have happened to them?

I'm not too well versed in the history of WWII, were their planes particularly unreliable? Or was it common for Japanese soldiers to defect, perhaps? Did this happen to other kamikazes?
