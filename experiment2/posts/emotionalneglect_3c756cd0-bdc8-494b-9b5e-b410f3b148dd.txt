recently found out about how emotional neglect looks like and it got me questioning.
I am (F)17, but recently i have been reading emotional neglect stories and some really hit home, i saw something that has happened to me and i only now realised it might not have so normal after all. I don’t truly think i was emotionally neglected, i think my parents weren’t perfect and that’s all but i also feel i might just be ignoring all the signs. 

Especially recently, my grandpa passed away and i was extremely close to him, like i would go as far and say that every moment with him was a blessing and always fun, and i can see 80% of me as him, we just got each other you know. And during the funeral, mourning, days, hours after everything i do not recall a single ounce of comforting from both of my parents, not a single hug out of compassion, fuck not even a pat on the back when i couldn’t look up at the funeral or was avoiding eye contact cuz i was fucking crying. But at the same time i never cried in front of them either (fully) i never let myself let them see me truly sad, fuck like even when my grandpa died i made jokes with my family to keep the mood light. genuinely don’t remember the last time i cried in-front of somebody and that might be my fault you know.

That event has truly made me look back on things, like i don’t remember the last time my parents praised me for something, made sure i was EMOTIONALLY okay, but then again i always shy away from genuine questions and shut them down, also i never share something i really love doing with them because that always leads to more expectations therefore a bigger fall if i dont succeed or something like that. FUCK like i am even scared to call my parents 2 times in a row because that could piss them off.

So you see my dilemma, i feel like i have been emotionally neglected yet i think i am also the big part of the problem… or maybe it’s just how things turned out
