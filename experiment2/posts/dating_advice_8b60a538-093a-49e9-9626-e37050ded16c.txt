How to get a date as an autistic person?
So I (28M) am officially diagnosed with hyperlexia, but also have symptoms comorbid with what used to be called Asperger’s. For simplicity’s sake, I call myself autistic…but I don’t bring this up with any potential partner for fear they’ll reject me. Even if I don’t say it, I sense they’ll sense it and want to drop me like a hot potato because how dare some creepoid like me want them? /s

In all seriousness though…I just really want to know a couple of answers. 

A) is being autistic a potential deal breaker for many people looking for a partner, as I keep believing it is?
B) how, in the absence of a great deal of friends, or places to meet potential partners irl, would I go about looking for dates? (I’ve given up on most dating apps fwiw)
