What works of Jacques Maritain does he address political economy?
I am interested in works by Jacques Maritain in which he addresses political economy and economic issues, such as norms surrounding property ownership, distributive justice etc.

I’ve read *Man and the State* and *Integral Humanism*, which provides some insight, but he does not address political economy in the detail I’m looking for.

Any recommendations?
