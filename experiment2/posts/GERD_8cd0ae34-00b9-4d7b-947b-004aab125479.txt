Anxiety episodes
I had been eating out for a week without considering the consequences and next day I was working in the office when I had a breathing problem ,I felt my senses numbing for a moment and stood up from my chair and it was gone but I could feel my heart was racing from probably panicking that it was a heart attack as it never happened before .

So I drove to the nearest hospital and as I drove my numbing returned , my sole focus was on breathing to calm my self but it helped little .

I got checked by the doctor and my BP was 160/110 ,the doctor gave me a captopril and did an ECG . Ecg was normal but the anxiety was not going away . She then gave me a syrip for aluminum hydroxide saying it might have been acidity and told me to go home and rest .

Next day I felt better thinking it was a one time episode . Boy I was wrong just 3 days later I had the same problem while in the office ,I tried to wait it out but the anxiety and breathing was not getting better .

This time I went to a cardiologist to ask their opinion . He checked me for a good 15 minutes and said that my heartbeat was not normal rhythm and beat was higher than 100 . The doctor ordered cholesterol ,echo ,thyroid tests . All tests were in the normal ranges . He gave me propanprolol for heartbeat and Omeprazole to check for acidity .it helped a little but the same anxiety and numbing senses episode happened again  this week . It just doesn't seem to go away 

I am afraid to eat normal meals as eating triggers this Everytime . I cannot eat regular size meals in fear of getting it triggered again . But I feel weak as well . I can't go to work and perform routine tasks in fear of this What should I do ?

Strenuous physical activity has no effect on the condition it doesn't worsen or make it better .

Although walking sometimes helps .

Please share your thoughts .

Edit : I would also like to point out that I am under stress and have been for 2 months . Could this be a factor ?
