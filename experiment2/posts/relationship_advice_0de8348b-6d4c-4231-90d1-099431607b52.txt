I want to ask my crush out but I'm afraid it might ruin our friendship
I just typed out a text to my crush saying I like her but I know she is going to reject me because recently we had a talk about types and preferences in dating and I am not her type at all. I'm afraid this could change our friendship so I don't want to send it even tho I can't move on if she doesn't reject me.
Please help.

Update: she rejected me
