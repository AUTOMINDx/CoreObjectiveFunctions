My referee refused my request for a reference despite previously agreeing...does it make my application look bad now?
I put an ex senior colleague down as one of three references for my master's application. When I last got in contact a few months ago (by email) they agreed to act as my reference for my next future *thing*, which ended up being the masters application I'm doing now. 

I sent off my application and the university I applied to sent off for a reference - I got an email back today saying *this person has informed us they are unable to provide a reference in support of your application*. 

I can put down another referee in their place fortunately, but does it make me look bad to have a referee come back and say no? Or am I overthinking this. 

Thanks.
