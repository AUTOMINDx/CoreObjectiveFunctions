Forehead temperature always several degrees HIGHER than oral temperature.

As I understand it, forehead temperature is generally about one degree (F) lower than oral temperature readings, and IR thermometers typically account for this by adjusting the reading. However, this not the case for me. Normally this would not matter to me at all, but now that businesses are checking everyone's temperatures before entry, I constantly have to worry about what the reading will say. I typically get readings over 100F on the IR thermometer when the oral thermometer reads just above or below 98F. I once had a reading above 102F on the IR thermometer and felt completely fine. I have seriously considered carrying around an oral thermometer just so I can show the door person what it says when they deny my entry.

Is there some condition that can cause this discrepancy? The only potential causes I could find for IR thermometers reading too high were: Direct sunlight, working out, stress, or eating something hot. However, this discrepancy occurs even when I have just been sitting inside with the AC on watching TV.

To be clear, this isn't a question about having an abnormally high body temperature, it is specifically about why my forehead usually reads several degrees higher than my oral temperature.
