Stopping my vulnerability for my mental health
Being empathetic or passionate emotionally has ruined my life. My autism has ruined my life. I've come to the conclusion im not connecting with people the right way or at all. Every single person leaves soon after getting to know me a little. 

The truth is, not a single person cares how you feel or if you're doing bad. They care a lot if you're doing good though. No one wants to hang around someone who has depression or anxiety. 

As an adult if you don't have your own place, car, social life, job, hobbies, working out and eating healthy, at peace 99 percent of the time chances are you will never have friends or people who want to stay in your life. Seasonal at best. If you're life doesn't look appealing from the outside no chance in someone wanting to know you. 

This is just reality. I'm not asking for sympathy on this either. 

Humans are naturally selfish and inconsiderate of others for the sake of survival. You have to learn how to "be" nice or be happy. When you're upset you just are. No one has to teach you how to be angry. You do have to learn how to be kind and nice to others. 

I don't believe any act of kindness is done just because, it's another ego stroke. I'm sure someone will say I sound like a miserable draining person and that's why my life sucks. But I don't vocalize on this ever in my daily life nor do I discuss my feelings at all actually. I don't want to be that person everyone avoids because they aren't happy all the time. 

Or maybe I just have nothing to offer.
