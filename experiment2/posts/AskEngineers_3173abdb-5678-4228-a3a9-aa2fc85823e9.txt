Hate my new job, what do now?
Been with a new company for about 3 months now and I dislike all of the work I do. It's a company that works for a gas distribution company exclusivly and none of their work is challanging. It's just reviewing thousands of permits for like small repair jobs. There's no design work, they don't value PE licenses and the pay is less than offers I have received since I started working here. How long do I have to stick this out? Is it rude to bail directly after that year end profit sharing bonus check cashes?
