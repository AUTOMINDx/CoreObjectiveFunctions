NC Ndad contacted me
I’ve been NC with my ndad at the advise of my therapist. And also because I don’t want anything to do with him.

Well. He got my number some how. I don’t have it on social media anywhere. Anyone who has my number wouldn’t give it to him, and it’s a new number anyways. So that’s terrifying that he got it.

I told him not to contact me and pretty much told him that he was a gaslighting narcissist and to never contact me. My family was a blended one. Both of my parents had kids before they got married and had me. My dads son from a previous marriage sexually abused me when I was 2/3. It was very severe. My dad protected him and wanted to sweep everything under the rug and lied to me about it my entire life. ‘That never happened. Your sister lied.’

Well, after trying for a baby for a year my husband and I found out that I had severe scaring in my uterus that made my chances of conceiving very slim. Dad still denied everything. His daughters from previous marriage sided with him and they’re pretty cruel. My dad ended up having an affair and my parents got divorced. 

I called him out on everything. I’m really struggling now. Talking to him is a huge trigger. 

Before I could block him he called me a liar and said that my lack of relationship with some of my siblings is my fault. I went nc limited contact with many of them because abuse and they wouldn’t respect boundaries. 

So now I’m spiraling. I can’t talk to my mom about it because she takes twisted pleasure whenever I stand up to him and thrives on that contention and shares it with everyone and anyone. My husband is very supportive. 

Ndad is blocked again but I feel on edge and kind of violated. How did he get my number? Who in my close circle gave it to him? Why do I suddenly feel responsible for everything wrong in my family?
