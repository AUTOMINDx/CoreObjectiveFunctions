Had one of the best dates ever and it was incredibly low effort
It was our second time meeting and I told her I was kinda tired but still wanted to see her

I had planned for us to go to this museum and get food and drinks and this whole ordeal

She ended up just coming over to my place in pajamas, we smoke/drank, played video games and made out

It was the most relaxed I’ve ever been on a date and she felt the same way, it was awesome

Maybe I’m just a weird case, the museum idea was kinda stressing me out, I definitely don’t plan on every date being like this one and will for sure be doing some more adventurous activities for dates in the future. I guess I’m just trying to say prioritize having fun and being relaxed and not every date has to be some grand gesture to impress, it worked for me anyways, just wanted to share!
