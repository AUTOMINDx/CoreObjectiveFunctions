I don't like hanging out with my uni friend group
I feel awful for saying this but I genuinely don't like hanging out with them. I feel that I'm just part of the group due to mutual friends and that they're nice people to talk to. But most of the time it's just small talk. I'm good friends with at least 2 of them but the rest, I don't like being around. I feel that I just don't fit in. Maybe it's just social anxiety because they always organise activities that I don't want to participate in and I get nightmares about. Maybe I'm just a party pooper or killjoy..i really don't know. I just don't have anything in common with them. There's a party this weekend and I really do not want to go ;-;. But they asked me if I was free and I said yes. I'm planning on skipping it closer to the date because I don't have anything to wear for it and they're planning on doing a talent show to which i really don't want to participate in. Alot of the times I fake being happy around them. I end up feeling exhausted and not my best self.

This was just a little rant. I'm feeling a little anxious because I feel like they're catching on to me never coming over but I genuinely just don't enjoy their company as awful as it sounds. :&lt; Is anyone experiencing a similar thing? Does anyone have any tips on approaching this?
