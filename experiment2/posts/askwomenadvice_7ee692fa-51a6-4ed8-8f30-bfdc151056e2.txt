How do you streamline online dating and avoid the guys looking for casual sex?
I (36, f) am looking to date to find a relationship. I'm honest and direct about this. I am not interested in casual sex in the least.

But SO much of my time is wasted by guys who are just looking for casual sex. 

Either they don't bother to look at what my profile says I'm looking for, and/or think it's worth asking anyways... By waiting after we've done some talking for a while, so a waste of my time. And it's not uncommon to go on a date and then have it turn out they were lying about it not being for casual sex.

Filtering profiles for what guys are looking for doesn't help, bc a lot have nothing or a relationship listed. 

I know online dating isn't great, but I don't have an alternative. How can I avoid those guys and stop having them waste my time?

Before anyone says it, my criteria is around my age, decent human being and mutual attraction. So what exactly am I supposed to narrow that down to?
