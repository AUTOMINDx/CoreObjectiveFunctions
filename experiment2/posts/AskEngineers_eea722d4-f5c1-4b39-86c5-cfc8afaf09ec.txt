Simulating automatic Transmissions (sort of) for a computer game
Hey there,

for a computer game I‘m trying to somewhat simulate an automatic transmission. I‘ve already read about this topic a little bit and found, that irl shift maps are used to determine shift points. 

The problem I have is that I don’t really know how to come up with these shift maps and especially how they could translate to a mathematic expression. 

Many scientific publications I found were very complicated and hard to understand. I‘m a high school student in Germany and don’t have any engineering and physics expertise. 

The point is,  I don’t aim for a realistic simulation. It just needs to „feel“ right. Basically I just need a way to let my program shift up late if a lot of throttle is applied and shift up early if less throttle is applied. 

Variables I can use for the calculation are

Gear shift ratios
Current Engine Torque
Current RPM
Min/Max RPM
Applied Throttle
And a few other basic variables 


I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to come up with such an expression. It would be awesome if someone could even suggest one.
