How mandatory are non mandatory office Christmas parties
I’m much younger than the people I work with and while we get along well enough I don’t really feel like driving 2 hours (4 total) to come in on a Friday night for a Christmas party that was said to be optional…on the other hand I know that often times what people say and what they mean are two totally different things.


Do I have to go to this thing you think?
