It's a numbers game when you figure out what makes you happy.
People will come and go in this one life you have. Your spouse, your parents,  work colleagues, friends, your side chick,  your fwb, etc. The only constant in it until your death is YOU. Come to grips with your mortality and theirs. Your happiness is the only thing that matters and even that comes and goes. That's life! Can't have happiness without sorrow. 

Find your happiness in yourself and what you do! Then share it with others. Always be mindful of your limited time on this earth.
