Does anyone have hair loss or very fine hair? Afraid to date.
Unfortunately I have quite severe hair loss but I have curls so itâ€™s easy to hide it because I can just pull it up in a bun. 

I have never been in a relationship before but once I move out, I will try to put myself out and start dating. That being said, I wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar predicament?

Thanks!
