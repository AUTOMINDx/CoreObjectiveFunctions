My parents constantly make fun of my backup plans
I'm a university student, but I don't think that I'll be able to finish it, because of my deteriorating mental health. I have good grades, but my mental health is awful.

So, I came up with possible career choices if I want to stop uni, or if I fail out.

One is becoming an air traffic controller. It's one of the best paying jobs in my country.

The other is becoming a baker.

My parents constantly make fun of my backup plans, and always moan when I mention the possibility of stopping my university studies.

They make these sarcastic remarks, and they see that I'm getting agitated, but they just keep on telling me these "jokes".

I've fucking had enough. They've been abusing me my whole life, and they have never cared about my shitty mental health.

I want to curl up in a ball and cry.

I just want parents who accept and support my choices. But that's a luxury in today's world, it seems.
