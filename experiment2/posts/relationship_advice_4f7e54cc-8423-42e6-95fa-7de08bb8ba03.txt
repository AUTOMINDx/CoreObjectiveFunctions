I (33m) think my gf (32f) is in the starting stages of an emotional affair
My gf recently made a friend in the gym she attends. He is 32m and is engaged. And he is a gamer too which is an important detail. One week after meeting him suddenly my gf bought a gaming console and this is a woman who has never played a video game in her life, but now she is gaming 2-3 hours everyday. Ok, it might be a coincidence but she has also been spending a lot of time on her phone and almost always turns her phone away from me. And she is a lot more secretive with her phone too, she even carries it with her to the washroom (another new behavior from her). I asked her jokingly that it seems she has found a new bf and I am feeling ignored but she got offended and said she is allowed to have male friends and this a someone who has a guy best friend with whom she is very close and I never had any objection to that because he is a very good guy. But this situation is giving me a bad gut feeling.

So what are my options here guys? Do I confront her directly? Do I just let it go? Do I talk to her bff to see if he has any ideas (he has become a very good friend of mine too)? Help guys.

**Edit/Update- Thank you to everyone who replied. I have decided that I will have a frank talk with her. Maybe there is an innocent reason, maybe its already gone past the point of no return. But I will have to talk in order to find out which is the case!**
