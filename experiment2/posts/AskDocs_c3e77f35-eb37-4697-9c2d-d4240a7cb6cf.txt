Can atypical anti-psychotics make me "dumb"? Decline in cognitive functioning
I'm 22 years old and I started taking paroxetine 40mg and risperidone 3mg last year for my OCD. Before that I always had great concentration, focus, memory and comprehension abilities. 

Everything changed when I started those 2 medications and I suspect it's the risperidone that's causing it. I literally can't concentrate at all while studying, I've lost this whole year of college because of this. I feel dumb now and can't learn, is this a possible known side effect of risperidone or is it more likely to be caused by the paroxetine?
