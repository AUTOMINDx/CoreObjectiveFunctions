How do I tell my mom I don't want her to be the other person in the delivery room?
I (18) was there 2 years ago when my nephew was born. Just being in the room and seeing my mom staring as he came out left me uncomfortable. I've said as such and have a solid idea that she will do the exact same thing to me. My fiance and I are having a baby that will be the first grandchild on his side. The baby is due in January, however, we think he will be here sooner (late December I'm guessing). I'm allowed 2 people and i want it to be my fiance and his mom. While I am thankful my mother is fixing up the basement, she's dragged it out an awful lot and hasn't really done anything else to help. She's also been badmouthing me behind my back and has recently made disgusting jokes about myself and my upbringing. I do anything and it's downplayed or treated as a joke. Food I buy and pay for for my fiance and i is treated as her or my dad's. There's so many things adding up that make me want to ditch this place altogether, but i just can't afford to. And the one I really dont want to be messed up is my birth experience. Anyone in that room who is supporting me (excluding doctors and nurses), is expected to stay above my waist and not stare at my privates. I'm not sure where exactly my discomfort comes from, but i really just dont want my mom to be there. Anything to do with my pregnancy just seems to be a bother to her or a quiet jab at how i was unwanted by her. I don't know how to tell her in a way that will cause the least damage. Is there any way to tell her and not cause an argument?
