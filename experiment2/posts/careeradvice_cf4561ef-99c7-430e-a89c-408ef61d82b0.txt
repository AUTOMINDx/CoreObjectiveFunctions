how did you get your shit together?
i have an extremely shitty GPA(1.0), caught in a vicious cycle of signing up for general ed classes and dropping out after the first three weeks, no drivers license at age 21 and being so scared do drive. A terrible resume with big gaps and only two legit jobs. Looking for success stories and advice
