Help with magnetohydrodynamics problem

Here the problem in full. What I have done so far is rewritten the left-hand side using the triple cross product rule and canceled terms using the following information from MHD:

div B = 0

v dot del = 0

So now I am left with the expression

\- \\vec{B} (div \\vec{v}) + ( \\vec{B} dot del) \\vec{v}

How can I rewrite this to match the right hand side?
