[Pokemon] Should I be concerned that I keep blacking out?
Amateur trainer here, new to the battling scene. I've won a few and lost a few -- but I notice that whenever I run out of Pokemon, I straight up black out and wake up a couple hours later in the Pokemon Center. This has happened a few times now; my mom is worried and wants me to give up battling.

Should I be concerned? Like should I be talking to a neurologist or a psychiatrist or someone about this? Nobody else seems to black out when *their* Pokemon are out.
