What kind of therapy worked for you? And what didn't?
Hi, so I have been seeing a therapist since August and it's CBT. I have noticed that it's not helping me at all. And in last session she made a comment saying "just get over it.. you don't have to think about it" in a polite manner but.. I just went??? 

She said she thinks I have awareness about myself. I have an understanding of myself and we keep talking about same things again and again and how I am not trying to put efforts from my end. 

I want to be able to find a trauma informed therapist. And hopefully quickly get to an alternative treatment plan because talking about it.. doesn't really help me much..

Edit: so to give better context on my trauma 
TW for ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP

-I discovered that the man I was with was actually hiding a child from me, lied about his age, ethnicity, profession and educational background. 
Lied about his grandparent's death. His black friend's death. Other traumatic instances knowing death was a sensitive subject to me after my father passed away.
- would constantly keep me in an anxious cycle with indirect threats of suicide, his mother being hospitalized, sister overdosing, news about his grandma passing away.. and I discovered all of them were just lies. He just got a kick out of it or my panic attacks and anxiety were some form of affirmation to him. 
- he discarded me for having exams.. and then I discovered that this man actually serially sexually exploits multiple women with lies about himself. He was stalking his exes on fake accounts. Made multiple fake accounts. Had multiple numbers. Has multiple phones. Had also tried to get nudes from a 17 yo posing as a 18 yo. And it put me in a state of shock.. 

Because I was with this man, he proposed to me.. I was just a sexual tool.. he actually had another woman and a 4 yo with her. 
His sister's boyfriend was also a gang member serving jail time. 

And my paranoia about him has been really really bad.
