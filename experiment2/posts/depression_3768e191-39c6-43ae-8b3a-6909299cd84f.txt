Made my mom cry
Sorry for bad english.

she came back from the pta meeting and obv my grades were shit. Like on all my tests I lost atleast one or two grades (most tests are out of five). Iâ€™m constantly being compared with my smarter sisters and the rest of the girls in my school, which is like yeah everyone gets better grades than me bc im dumber than the rest of them. Poor woman, called my older sister and started crying about how I wouldnâ€™t get into collage. I feel like shit, hopefully I die before I finish secondary school (im in 11th grade now) idk what im expecting out of this cuz whenever I talk about how I feel to ppl I either 1-reprimanded or 2-guilted. I miss online school ffs.ðŸ™ƒ
