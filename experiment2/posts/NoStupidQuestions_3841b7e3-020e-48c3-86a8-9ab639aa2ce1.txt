Why are managers so much more unprofessional when an employee is leaving in lower paying jobs than higher ones?
People I know who make not a lot,&lt;40k, it seems managers give them a hard time about putting in there notice. Managers I hear give them a hard time and guilt trip for leaving. While at jobs that pay better you give your two weeks and the manager tells you “best of luck”  and no hard feelings. Why is this?
