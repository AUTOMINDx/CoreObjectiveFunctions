Do what I am interested in or play it safe?
I’m very torn and at a cross roads in life currently. 

Please give me advice based on my situation. 

I’m 26, I’ve been working 2 jobs for the last 9 months. And I’m at a point now where I need to decide what I want to do. One job I work in corporate under the VP and Ive been offered a full time position. My other job is a server in a restaurant. My corporate job is great but it’s not what I’m passionate about. I really don’t enjoy sitting in a office and working the 9-5. I’ve always working in the beauty industry or night clubs/bars. My dream is honestly to create YouTube videos and content on social media while also doing nails and have my own studio one day (I’m a licensed cosmetologist)

Here what I’ve been trying to decide between

1. Work my corporate job, but have less time to create content or do nails. (Also I work with my fiancés mom and it has effected our relationship negatively)

2. Quit the corporate job, serve at night, but have more time now during the day to create content and do nails

I’m honestly scared to bet on myself. I’m afraid I’ll quit my good paying corporate job to serve at night and not do what I’m passionate about. I’m afraid I’ll fall off and get lazy. Such as watching tv all day or sitting on my phone.
