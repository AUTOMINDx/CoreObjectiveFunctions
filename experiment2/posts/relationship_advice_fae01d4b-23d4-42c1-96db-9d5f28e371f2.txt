Contemplating leaving nearly perfect husband because guilt over not wanting kids?
*For background,* my husband and I have been together for over 5 years. We met when I was 21. I'm now 26, he's 29. We've been apart for six months while I'm away with the military. He and I are nothing alike but we've always gotten along really well. My friends have said I have a huge personality, whereas his is not so much. He's a pretty simple man. (His words, not mine.) He's the kind of guy who has never had strong motive for doing much, whereas I'm always driven in one direction or another, so much of our marriage has been driven by my decisions. We've always been happy together, though I've described my love for him like an ebb and flow - sometimes I am nearly obsessed with him and other times, it's just a quiet, subdued love that feels more like comfort.

**The issue is, I don't want kids and he does.**

We've been married for a few years and despite not thinking I wanted kids my entire life, I was never sure because the future was so far away and I guess I believed everyone when they said that eventually, I would come around. It was a lot of pressure from all directions. With this in mind, my husband and I had discussed a few times a theoretical plan to have one biological child (because he wants one) and adopt one child (because I've always wanted to adopt). I've also been *very open* about how horrific I find pregnancy and childbirth and how much I don't really like kids. We keep getting older and my opinions aren't changing. I know more now than ever that I don't want to have a baby. I'm not even certain motherhood is for me at all.

**I finally told him that I decided I can't do it.** I feel so guilty because he loves me so much, he said he'd give up fatherhood. I've never seen him cry before but he sobbed. He has cried every time we talk. I know he's always wanted to be a dad and I firmly believe he would be the best father in the world. I truly think he was born to be a dad.

Now I'm suffering because I don't think I can carry the weight of that sacrifice with me moving forward. When we do, I'm just so afraid he'll harbor resentment and either become depressed/unfulfilled down the line, or leave me. (This is less likely. I'm not sure there's anything that could make him go.)

This guilt has led to me considering all the things he's done for me in the past and I am engulfed in guilt. Our relationship has tended to feel like I'm living my life and he's just been coming with me. He says he loves that I live my life on a whim sometimes but it's feeling less fair to him, like I am his whole life and he's only part of mine. It's just sort of spiraled into me feeling like I don't love him nearly as much as he loves me and that he deserves someone who can give him a life with a child. I just keep thinking that if we're going to separate over this, I'd rather do it sooner than later so we're both still young enough to move on.

**If he told me that he had to leave me because of this, I would be in a lot of pain from the loss but I know in my heart I would understand and I would be okay.** But he won't ever tell me that. He told me that even if he could move on from me, he would never be able to fully love another person because I would always be there. So now I feel like I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't.

Either I have a child I don't want, leave him and break his heart, or stay with him and carry this guilt and uncertainty forever. I guess I'm just looking for advice. (I'm going to talk to a marriage counselor soon.)

tl;dr my husband is possibly the best man I've ever met in every way, he wants kids, I just fully realized I don't, and he'll never leave me but I am drowning in guilt

Any advice/direction?
