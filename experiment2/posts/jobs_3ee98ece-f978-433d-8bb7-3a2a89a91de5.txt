Super stressed at work. Should I ask a raise?
I work at a law firm. I moved up to litigation a few months back after someone higher up left and things had to be switched around. Since then, 2 more people have left and more work has piled on me and on Monday they informed me that another person in our litigation department is going to be leaving at the end of the week, and I’m supposed to be taking over her workload which involves a lot of interaction with the attorneys handling litigation. Basically at this point I am handling the jobs of 4 people, and it’s getting to me. I have 700 unread emails in my personal inbox as of today (not all of which directly involve me, but I need to be sure they are dealt with, but i try and prioritize emails from clients and attorneys first) and involvement in 600 files. They just hired 2 new people with 0 experience, so they need training on everything pre-litigation to my old job in litigation (filing, serving defendants). It’s going to be at least a month if not more to get them up to speed. I just got a raise from $14 to $16 an hour the week before Thanksgiving, but that was before I was taking on another person’s job. Is it too soon to ask for another raise, and how much is too much? My official title is a legal assistant in Orlando, FL, but most of the work I do I consider to be that of a paralegal’s job.

Edit: this is my first job in a law firm/office job in general, and I’ve only been here 6 months. My previous experience was in retail. I think it’s going to be hard finding a better job in this market with my relative lack of experience.
