Is it OK to ghost a homophobe
So I (26F) went on two dates with a man (28 M) that I met online. I am not religious and he is, however he seemed pretty liberal about it and I don't mind dating someone religious as long as they don't try to push their beliefs onto me. First date went well so we went on a second. 

On the second date I casually mentioned that my brother was gay. Didn't think anything of mentioning it, it was never a big deal in my family. His reaction was "I'm so sorry" and asked if we were still in contact and seemed to hint at asking if we tried to "fix it" but he didn't outright say it. I said that yes we are still in contact, and there is nothing to fix. He dropped it after that and the conversation moved on. 

I'm taking this as a major red flag and don't want to go out again. I generally don't think ghosting is OK, but I have learned people like this can't be reasoned with, and frankly I don't want to try. He texted me to hang out again and it's been four hours and I have not responded. Is ghosting in this situation justified? I feel a little bad about it but think the resulting conversation would be pointless and upsetting, and there is minimal chance I will run into this person again.
