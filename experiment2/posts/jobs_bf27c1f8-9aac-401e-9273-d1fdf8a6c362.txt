Handing my resignation in tomorrow
Nervous about handing my resignation in tomorrow. I signed my contract for my new job today. 

If they do a counter offer I am prepared to turn it down. I read that it's just a band aid fix and I know that this job I am now is dead end for me 

My boss likes me and he re hired me after I got fired due to covid and being in my probation. It's end of the year and he's still trying to fill another job gap and now I am leaving he will have to fill another 2 jobs. I am doing a 2 person job plus a new system is getting put in place. Worst time to do this but oh well. I'm sure they will manage some how
