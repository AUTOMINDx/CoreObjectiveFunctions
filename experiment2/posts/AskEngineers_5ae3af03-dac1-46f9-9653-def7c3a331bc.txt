Do I stay for more experience or maybe be to new company just now? Renewables and oil/gas engineering
Mods feel free to remove if this is not suitable for the page. 

I have been offered a new job and really need some impartial advice but wasn't sure where to ask.

I am an engineer working in offshore wind installation. A considerable smaller company has offered me a role with 50% pay increase, as they are pushing into renewables with new boats being built for it and want me to be a part of the team due to my experience. I would be split across both oil&amp;gas and renewables (they are tendering stage) whereas just now I am just renewables. My current company is larger and sometimes feel I am fighting for the good experience due to the majority of the company being based abroad. 

Do I stay where I am longer to gain more renewables experience and then jump across as a senior or move now whilst they are on the uptick? 

I have 5 years exeriencd. 3.5 in oil/gas installation work and 1.5 in renewables installation work.

Any advice would be appreciated

UPDATE: Thanks for your help all. For those who are interested, I was promoted to Senior Engineer at my current company (they didn't know I had a job offer) bit I have now accepted the other companies offer. They upped the offer to Senior Engineer / package manager.
