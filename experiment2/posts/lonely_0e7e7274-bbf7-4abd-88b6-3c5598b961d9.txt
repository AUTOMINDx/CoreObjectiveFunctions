I am so dissatisfied with my life
I have a good job, a partner who loves me, and a pretty cute pup. But I feel so dissatisfied. 

I don’t do anything outside of work. I don’t have any friends I can talk to. I just stay at home either doing house work or scrolling through my phone with the tv on as background noise. I take my dog for walks but aside from that? Nothing.

I recognize I have many things I should be grateful for and happy with. But I’m so frustrated and sad and alone.
