Where do I get the motivation to follow my treatment?
I (18F) have recently been diagnosed with hypermobility spectrum disorder (technically hEDS but my geneticist doesn’t want to diagnose. it’s complicated) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. I have a lot of meds and other treatments that include pt exercises. I have never missed a dose of my medication but lately I have been having a hard time being motivated to take my meds on time and do pt and exercise. I’ve been on medication for over a year and it’s taking it’s mental toll. I still have symptoms and I feel like crap all the time. I physically struggle to swallow my meds every day and it’s even harder to get out of bed. I’m only 18 and I’m not enjoying this life of limiting everything I do around my health. This stupid impostor syndrome has me thinking that stopping all my meds would make me feel better. I don’t want to take meds everyday to just feel sort of normal. I hate it. I hate the doctors visits. I hate the meds. I hate the pain. I want to take my meds and find a regimen that helps but mentally I can’t get myself to follow treatments no matter how hard I try. My mom used to keep me accountable but now I live on campus at my college and am more or less on my own.
