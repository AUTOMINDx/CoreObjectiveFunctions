I feel behind in my career and my salary
I’m 33 years old and I have a BA in history.  I have nine years of customer service experience, three years of experience as an administrative assistant, and five years in online marketing content management experience.  I live in a large city in Minnesota so, the cost of living is super expensive.  I make $43,000 a year and barely get by.   I got divorced a year and a half ago.  I put my career goals to one side because my ex didn’t want to move from the small town we lived in.  And I put my energies into supporting him in his small business.  Now, I’m at a place where I want my own house and kids one day and I’m scared that will never happen because most employers around here refuse to pay more than $45,000 a year for the roles I’m qualified for.  

Are there any positions that pay $60,000+ a year that would hire someone with a BA in history?
