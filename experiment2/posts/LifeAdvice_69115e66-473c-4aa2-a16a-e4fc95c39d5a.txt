I need help
Dear Reddit life has come knocking on my door the hardest ever this week right when things are going up for me.  I’ve been studying for my personal training exam, had a good part time job and life has been looking up for me. On Sunday however it has taken a drive I got into a major car accident. Totaled my car. Lost my job today. Don’t have more then 0.06 in the bank. How do I pick myself up after this rocky balboa knock out? I need to get a new car. A job. And a way out of this rut depression. Please help me
