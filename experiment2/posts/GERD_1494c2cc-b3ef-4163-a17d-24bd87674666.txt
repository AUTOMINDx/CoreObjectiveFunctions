The hardest thing for me in treating GERD
I bounce back from flare ups very quickly.  I go on the GERD diet, take digestive enzymes, cut out caffeine, and I do intermittent fasting, and within one to two weeks, I am symptom free.  Yesterday, I ate a dish including onions and tomatoes and I was fine.  

However, it takes at least two months for the esophagus to completely heal, (and it takes two months to not feel low motivation from caffeine withdrawal).  

I want caffeine, and could use it.  But that messed me up last time when I had a flare up and was right back where I started within days of ingesting black tea in my case.  

How to keep motivated during healing?    Also, is drinking coffee or tea ever an option again for GERD sufferers or just needs to be cut out forever?
