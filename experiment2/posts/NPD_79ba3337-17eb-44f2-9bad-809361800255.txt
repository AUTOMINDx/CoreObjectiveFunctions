Difference between NPD &amp; Narcissistic
Just wondering what the key differences are? 
I’m not sure if I have NPD or am a narcissistic person with traits. 
I can tell you absolutely everyone in my life I manipulate, I have done since I was a child really, I also made friends with people I see as lesser than me, people I can control, I have never felt comfortable around people who I see as better looking or more successful. 
I do not truly care about anyone but like to keep my image up as a nice good person. 
I’m exploitive, I use people, tbh as I’m listing this I can see I’m an awful person &amp; it does wound me. What’s weird is when I was doing it I didn’t feel bad at all.
Someone with traits wouldn’t be this messed up? 
I also have very low empathy. I only bother with people if I need something from them or too appear like I care. 
It’s so fuckin weird that I was able to blind myself to what I was doing. 
My minds so scrambled rn.
