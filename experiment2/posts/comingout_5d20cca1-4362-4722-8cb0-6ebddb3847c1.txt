Bi ace
So, I’ve discussed it with my soon-to-be ex-husband, and we agree that in announcing our divorce, it makes sense and feels like the time for me to come out, as that is a large part of why we are divorcing. (He’s super supportive, we’re just better off as friends.) 
I am biromantic asexual. I often just say bisexual because it’s simpler.  
I want to come out as the most true version of myself, but I don’t think my sex life is someone else’s business. I hope to have an ace partner in the future, and I don’t like the idea of people not taking the relationship seriously or something because they know we’re ace.  
But, what’s the point of coming out if I’m lying about my identity still? And maybe any future prospects see that post and that causes issues.  
Idk idk any input would be helpful
