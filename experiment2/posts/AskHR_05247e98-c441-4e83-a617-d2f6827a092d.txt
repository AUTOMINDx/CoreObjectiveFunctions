[IN] Improving my “people skills”
I have a tendency to become very wordy so I’ve been trying to become more concise and direct. One peer and one employee have complained to HR about the wording of my emails, so HR is now encouraging me to work on improving my “soft people skills”. Do you have any tips for me?

Also, I’m not sure what to do about my employee’s complaint about my wording. We did mediation with HR and my employee would like for me to address things more kindly (their example was “I noticed xyz, can you abc?”). I’ve tried approaching issues very kindly (ex: “I noticed xyz, what’s going on there?….okay, let’s do abc to fix that”) but after addressing the same issues time after time, I had to resort to corrective action. They felt blindsided by it because they don’t recall me EVER addressing the issues. As a result, I’ve been trying to be more direct (ex: I noticed xyz. My expectation is that we prevent xyz from happening by doing abc.) and I’ve been trying to do it in writing so that I’d have proof of it being addressed. What’s your recommendation on how I can address issues in a kind yet direct manner?
