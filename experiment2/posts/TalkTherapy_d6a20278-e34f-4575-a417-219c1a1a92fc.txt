The "work" in your language
To those of you who do therapy in a language besides English, do you say "doing the work" like we do in English, or do you use a different word than "work"?

It's always felt weird to me that we refer to the effort and progress in therapy as "work", the same way I talk about my job. Just curious if other languages have a different way of talking about that concept that makes it feel like something different from your employment.
