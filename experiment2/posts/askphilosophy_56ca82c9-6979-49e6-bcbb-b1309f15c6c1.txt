If you were temporarily given the power to end all life, would choosing NOT to do so mean you would be ethically responsible for all the suffering that came afterwards?
On one hand, the responsibility seems like too heavy a burden. If you did press the button so to speak, you would be responsible for ending the lives of trillions of beings on Earth and possibly many more elsewhere. But if you do not press it, doesn't that also mean that you are responsible for any form of suffering for any being that comes afterwards, since there is a direct causal relationship between your decision and the occurrence of those sufferings?
