Should I(F16) do psychiatry or dentistry
Backstory: my mom is a dentist and ever since I(F16) was young I used to go to her clinic so I know a lot of stuff abt dentistry but I'm really interested in psychology or making ppl feel good and wanted to help people w that but I wanna do something in the field of biology only but I'm questioning my decision of wanting to become a psychiatrist rn. AND I'm studying pcb and struggling a lot w it because of procrastination and other stuff. And we live in india(guj).

So what I thought was that after I'm done w my NEET I'd go outside India to study for BDS but the whole process isn't quite easily and takes up a up of money and also I maybe can start off from my mom's clinic which she told is a good idea but I dont wanna live in the city I am currently in rn. But at the same time I wanted to do something related to psychology/therapy. And ofc we can't forget that going into a med school requires a lot of efforts and time. So what do u think I should do?
