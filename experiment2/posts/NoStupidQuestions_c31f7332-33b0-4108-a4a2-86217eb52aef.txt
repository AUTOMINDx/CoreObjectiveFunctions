My mother-in-law gave us her Christmas tree and I hate it.
We still have our old tree, which I love. This new one is fat and oddly shaped. It's not like something I can put out only when she's coming over, so now I'm stuck looking at it every day until January. 

Is there a solution to this that doesn't involve putting up two trees which is a pita? Her feelings are easily hurt with stuff like this. She thinks it's beautiful so everyone should.
