Tired and feeling nothing
Hi, i'm 25 and i have a very serious depression, don't know what else to do, alredy deleted a whole cloud of memories, photos and videos. I'm feeling totally lost, and i am feeling more and more empty with each day passing, i blocked all muy friends for no reason it's like i am in automatic mode.
Also i feel that therapy isn't working for me.
