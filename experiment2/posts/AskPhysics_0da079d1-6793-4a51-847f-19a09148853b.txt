At what speed could a person travel fast enough to no longer be clearly visible to the human eye?
So I'm wondering (physical side effects of travelling at said speed aside though welcome to be mentioned) is it possible to become invisible to observers or at least  become a blur and at what speed does this happen?

It is for a fiction book with an alien species but I want to know the physical possibility, parameters and effects.
