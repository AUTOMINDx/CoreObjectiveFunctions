high load AC electronic dimmer - cheaper alternative?
Hi,

I'm building my own coffee roaster with arduino and a popcorn popper and I've run into a special need, an electronic controlled triac dimmer. I'm using more powerful poppers and their resistance powers are somewhere between 1400-1800W on 127V - 60Hz.

I've tried this dimmer: [https://www.tindie.com/products/bugrovs2012/pwm-16a-3500w-triac-leading-edge-dimmer-50hz-60hz/](https://www.tindie.com/products/bugrovs2012/pwm-16a-3500w-triac-leading-edge-dimmer-50hz-60hz/) and its result is amazing, but it's too expensive to use on this project.

Do you know of another pwm, serial or i2c controlled dimmer for high power resistive loads? It would be great if it was cheaper than the tindie one.

Thank you very much.
