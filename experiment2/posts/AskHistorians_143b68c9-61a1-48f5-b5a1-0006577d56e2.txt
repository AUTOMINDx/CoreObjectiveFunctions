How did labor unions go about accomplishing the changes they wanted?
I was thinking about working conditions during the Gilded Age and realized that the job market of today is somewhat comparable to back then. Primarily that people aren't getting paid enough and lots of people have to take multiple jobs just to make ends meet. The question is, how did laborers go about accomplishing the changes they wanted, and can it be applied to today's job market?
