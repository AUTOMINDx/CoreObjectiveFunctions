I was just feeling better : (
Hey guys I guess I need to vent. Opinions are invited..

I’ve been feeling better about myself lately. Got a job after being unemployed for a while, I feel better about my body, just overall more confident. Work has had me tired with the holiday hours. But at least at I was still feeling better. 
So I let myself indulge a bit with some wine. Nothing high in alcohol and pretty sweet. I make sure to eat before I drink at all. As yes I’m 21.
It just feels nice and I stretch out the bottle after work and make sure it’s a night I don’t work the next day. 
I think this is responsible and reasonable. But apparently not to my parents. My dad is away and my mom doesn’t talk to me. But I guess my “drinking” reached to my dad and they painted a picture that I get drunk almost every night. Which I don’t, honest. I just hear this scolding and felt like I was back in high school. Where my parents judged every move I made. Even as an adult it seems I can’t do things. 
Yeah I know I’m trying to save to move out. But things have been so nice lately I forgot about that idea. And now I just feel shitty and don’t feel like eating. Because I was planning to drink a little tonight too. I just feel like if I move and do so something it will be criticized. Sigh. Maybe I just need to get this out and I’ll be okay thanks to anyone who read through this..
