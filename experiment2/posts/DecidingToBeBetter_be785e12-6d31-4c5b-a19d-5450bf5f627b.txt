Trying again to start a healthy morning routine! Can I do it?
For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a tough time with mornings. I really want to be a person who gets up early and has some time to herself, gets a good workout and breakfast in before work. 

I decided this week I will just wake up early and make coffee, start getting ready, browse social media, listen to music. 

Next week I’m going to start doing half hour workouts in the mornings. I really need this! Wish me luck!
