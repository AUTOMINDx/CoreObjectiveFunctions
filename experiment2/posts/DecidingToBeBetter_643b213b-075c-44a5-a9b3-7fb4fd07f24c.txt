How do I just take care of myself? What are the simplest things I could do?
I grew up in an extremely neglectful and abusive household. I was underweight, wore dirty clothes for weeks, and always sick and basically lived in my dark, dirty bedroom to avoid interacting with my abusers. I was *profoundly LUCKY* to escape through a local housing program that helps people with drug addictions and mental and physical disabilities. I've had my own apartment here and have received counseling for two years now. 

Only issue is, I don't know how to live. I don't have any structure in my daily life, I focus so hard on just being aware of my basic needs (making sure I eat, shower, actually acknowledge how I'm feeling, ect) that stuff like applying for jobs, getting copies of all my legal documents in order, and general thinking about where I want my life to go is terrifying. 

I recently cut off all ties with my abusers though. I got a new phone that they don't know the number to, and made two new bank accounts that they don't know about. I can drive kinda but I don't have a permit or license.

I don't know what to focus on. Should I just start really small like making my bed every morning? How do I work up going to the grocery store regularly, and doing laundry? Everything just slips past me and I hate it.
