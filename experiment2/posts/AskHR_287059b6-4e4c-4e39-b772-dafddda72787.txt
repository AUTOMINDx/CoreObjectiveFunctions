[CO] Started a new job and benefits start Dec 1. Can I fully fund my HSA for 2021?
I started a new job in November at a very small start up. We don't have an HR department yet, so I'm not able to ask them this question: My benefits begin December 1st. One of those benefits is an HDHP health plan with an HSA. I would like to fully fund the HSA for 2021($7300 for my family), however I am not able to make any contribution changes from what I initially signed up for until Jan 1. Can I change my contribution so it's a lump sum of $7300 effective on Jan 1, and max out my HSA for 2021 using pre-tax dollars earned in 2022?

If it's relevant, my company is fully remote, and I work in Colorado. Also, I also plan to max out the HSA in 2022, so don't want to get a tax penalty for overfunding in 2022.
