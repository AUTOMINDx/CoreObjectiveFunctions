My parents don’t care about my feelings at all
They always argue and then turn to me like I have the answers to their problems. I wish they never dragged me into this. I never wanted this. They don’t care about my feelings on the matter at all. 

Whenever I express any anger or sadness about anything, they’re always like “oh so you’re saying I’m a bad mom/dad” “I’m doing my best here” “your just like your mom/dad” etc, like why can’t you just fucking CARE about me. I’m HURTING and all you can think about is yourself? I hate them. 

I wish I had people that cared about me but I don’t have any friends either. I want to kms, I can’t do it anymore. I’m so tired and alone, it’s driving me insane.
