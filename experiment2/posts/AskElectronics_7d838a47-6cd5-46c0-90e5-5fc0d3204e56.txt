Electronic Project Display
Scouring the internet for a type of display for my recent project. I just wanted a clear acylic front and back for my 2x2 square pcb. I have the stand offs needed but I can’t seem to find skeleton display kits. I’m newer to these projects, is it something makers always have to make on their own?
