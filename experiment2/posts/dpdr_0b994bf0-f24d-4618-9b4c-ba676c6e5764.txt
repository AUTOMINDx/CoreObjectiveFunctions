I feel like i've had mild derealization for about 5 years now, but only in the last week have I become too aware of it
And it's driving me nuts, it feels like i'm perpetually high and things just don't make sense. I start to look around and instantly become aware of how things don't feel very real, and it's driving my anxiety way up. I'm a hypochondriac so I don't think i'm going to be able to simply live with it anymore, so i'm wondering if there's actually some medication that will help cope with this? Is it a matter of trial and error? Any chance it could get worse?
