My (24) gf wants new furniture
For context, I M (25) am saving up to buy a home in the next year or so. My gf moved down to ATL from Chicago and got an apartment. Initially we were going to get a place together but held off as she was not ready for that step. We have been dating for a year and 4 months. 

For the time being and to save money since we did not get a place together I decided to stay at home with my parents. This left all my furniture from my old apartment sitting around not being used. I suggested that for the time being until her lease expires next year that she use my stuff and wait to buy new furniture until we moved in together. 

This was initially fine but now she wants nothing to do with my furniture "Its ugly and I don't want it in our new place". I am willing to accommodate to a style that is both hers and mine as my old apartment definitely has "bachelor" vibes. So while I am okay with getting new furniture I don't agree with buying all this stuff before we even know what the new place we are going to move into looks like let alone shell out a bunch of cash for stuff that only she approves as acceptable furniture. 

I think waiting is the smart decision but with black Friday deals going around and the couch she specifically wants heavily discounted this has been brought up again and is causing turmoil in our relationship.
