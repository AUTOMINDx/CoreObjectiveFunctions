What do nparents say to their surrounding to explain why we are NC with them ?
Today I felt quite intrigued by this question. 

My nmother has a mission to make herself appear as a modern open minded woman despite all the trauma she caused me. 

So I was puzzled by the idea that she has to explain to her friends why I am NC for almost 2 years.

I started imagining what she could says, ans honestly It made me smile to imagine her struggle with this (even tho she probably isnt) because tbh if someone tells me one day tha their child dont talk to them anymore I'll know for sure there is 90%chance it is the fault of the parent.

"My daughter is auper busy" so busy I might be president at this point.
"She is just a ungratful daughter" so ungrateful.
"She leaves abroad" yeah, in Mars.

What do tou imagine yours are saying, or if you know the answer, what is it ?
