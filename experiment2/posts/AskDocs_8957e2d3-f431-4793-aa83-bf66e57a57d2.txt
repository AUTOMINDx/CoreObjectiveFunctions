Toddler nighttime breathing
Hi my daughter 3F 14kg obviously  non smoker has been unwell on and off for some time. Chest infection (antibiotics given) end of October and just come off another course of antibiotics for a UTI. Been back and forth to A&amp;E and out of hours doctors as she still has this awful cough which keeps being put down to asthma as its only at night and chest and lungs are clear.  She has had a reliever and preventer inhaler for over a year which we have to use regularly or she will cough constantly. Last 3 weeks I've noticed when she sleeps she breaths really really fast. Counting 50 breaths per minute. Also accompanied by a clicking sound. During the day apart from the cough when we go out into the cold weather her breathing appears normal and she is a mostly happy child. 
Every time I've taken her to be seen the clinicians have dismissed this saying it's normal and I've been refused a referral to a paediatrician (UK). Please can someone advise me if I'm just being OTT or whether this is something I should push for further investigation. 
Full bloods taken during the summer and she was found to be slightly anemic. 

Thanks in advance from a worried mother
