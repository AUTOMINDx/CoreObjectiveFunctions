feeling alone and whatever
i can feel myself slowing distancing from the people i love. and i hate it. but i can't help it. i'm so scared of burdening them with the things i do, even if it's good things. everytime i think of literally anything i go "omg i want to tell someone" but i feel like i can't. why does this happen? how do i fix it? i don't want to be alone but i keep pushing everyone away and everytime i just wish that someone would keep chasing after me even if i push them away. but i know it doesn't work like that and it hurts. im tired of trying to be independent and only end up sabotaging myself. it is so incredibly painful to feel things and not be able to tell people about it, be it good or bad, happy or sad. i'm the one doing this to myself and yet i feel like people just don't care enough to pry about my life.
