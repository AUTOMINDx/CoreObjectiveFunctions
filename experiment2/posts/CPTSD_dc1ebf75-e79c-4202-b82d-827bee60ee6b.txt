I have the feeling that I am incapable of functioning in this society.
About me and my life situation: I am 21 years old and live in Germany and since half a year I live in my own apartment. I dropped out of school at the age of 14 because of my mental health. I am now trying to catch up on my schooling and it is extremely difficult for me to learn and go to school. I am consistently exhausted and miss at least one day a week of school due to exhaustion. I am trying my best but I feel like everything seems impossible for me because of my health. I know it's not my fault but it's also so hard to find good help and I'm so scared about my future.
