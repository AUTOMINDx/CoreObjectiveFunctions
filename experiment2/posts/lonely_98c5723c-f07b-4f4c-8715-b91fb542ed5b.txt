It's such a catch 22
34/f married with 3 kids. I am seriously right next to my husband hearing him snore.... I should not feel alone. But I am. stay at home mom, so the only conversations are with my kids or my spouse, and rarely are those conversations honestly asking or caring about me. Im missing laughter with a friend and conversation about things we both love.  I'm not wanting sex, hook up,or a relationship. I just want someone that cares enough to talk. Blah
