Jobs seeking in a collapsing economy
As of 2020 the Lebanese economy took a critical downturn and the average salary that was once equivalent to 1000 USD is now 60 USD
Following this Venezolanen model the Lebanese youth (including myself) is faced with 2 options : either leave the country in search of some kind of future or try and survive every day in this hellish import based economy. 
But there s a twist to this story : if ur making money in fresh dollars from lebanon then your life is actually cheaper than it was before the crisis 
So the questions every young Lebanese is trying to answer today is the following :
How can i get paid in dollars doing an online job ? 
Where should i look for opportunities ? 
Is social media the only place to get paid online ? 
What set of skills should i learn to be competitive online ? 
These and many other questions I come to ask here seeking maybe answers maybe advice but in all cases your opinions on this matter boggling my  mind .
