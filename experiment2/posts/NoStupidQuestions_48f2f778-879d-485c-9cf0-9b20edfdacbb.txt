Can Ford (or any car manufacturer) be held responsible for “repairing” a vehicle without actually repairing it?
My girlfriend has a Ford Escape that has had the same issue at least 10 times now. The car shuts itself off and won’t start up again. 


We’ve brought the car to ford every time since the car is under warranty and repairs are free (minus cosmetic repairs). Every time, they do something stupid like change the battery or check the alternator (which has been done numerous times to this car)


More recently, as in the last two times we had to take it there, they’ve had a technician drive it to try to replicate the problem after jumping the car. They say they don’t know what is causing the issue and that the technician couldn’t get the car to die on him like it always does to my gf. 


This is becoming a huge issue because she’s currently stranded on the side of the road while she was heading to work, now I have to go pick her up and get the car towed again. It’s a serious safety concern since it’s died twice on her while driving now and is only a matter of time before it causes an accident and harm to my girlfriend and others. 


What can we do to make ford actually fix this or replace the vehicle before it gets somebody killed?


Edit for clarity: the previous (about 6-8) times this happened, it was more of an annoyance because it wouldn’t start when she’d go to leave the house. These past two times it actually stopped WHILE she was driving


Tl:dr  we have a vehicle that is dangerous to drive on the road and the manufacturer won’t do anything even though it’s under warranty because they can’t find the root of the problem. How can we get them to actually fix this?

Update: they finally found the issue and actually repaired it, but the part required wasn’t under warranty. Go figure
