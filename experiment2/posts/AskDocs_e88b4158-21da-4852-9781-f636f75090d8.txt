Experiencing "lightning bolt" pain in my armpits and achy breasts. 27 female
I tested positive for covid yesterday and the last few weeks I've been experiencing achy breasts, that also feel heavy. (Definitely not pregnant) I check them daily and have no lumps, in the last few days they've started aching along with getting a pinching feeling in my arms pits? This also happened getting my second Modena vaccine back in August and lasted 3 weeks and stopped. 

Is this due to swollen lymph nodes and having covid? I'm experiencing body aches, high temperature and headaches with covid.
