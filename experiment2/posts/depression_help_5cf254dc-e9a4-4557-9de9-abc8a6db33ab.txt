Lonely
I’m 19F, I’ve been sexually assaulted/raped multiple times this year and was in a sexually abusive relationship for almost 4 years. It’s been about 8 months since we broke up and 3 months with no communication. A few days after he stopped talking to me, I found out he had a girlfriend! It makes me sick to my stomach. I think I was afraid of him and it makes me so mad that I was with him for so long. I don’t feel anything anymore. I am numb and tired and I don’t know how to live. I have no self esteem, like i’m 5’7 and weigh around 120 with a 24in waist. is this skinny?? I feel and look so fat but my mom keeps telling me how skinny i look. It breaks my heart knowing that she knows what i’ve been through. It’s so embarrassing so i don’t ever wanna talk about anything with her. I don’t have anyone to talk to though so i keep it bottled in. Idk how much longer i can go on, it’s getting harder everyday. Any tips?
