Does anyone have experience with blurry vision? (My eyesight is fine it’s just occasionally)
My biggest hinderance with derealization is when sometimes(mostly in the mornings) my vision gets all blurry almost like  there is a thick fog in the room and I can’t see past 5 feet clearly. Does anyone else experience this or have any tips on how to alleviate/prevent it?
