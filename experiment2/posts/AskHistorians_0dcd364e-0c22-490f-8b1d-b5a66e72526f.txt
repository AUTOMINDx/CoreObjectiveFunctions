How much of a factor was the National Convention banning slavery a part of Toussaint Louverture's decision to switch sides?
I read a biography on Toussaint, Black Spartacus, and it states that, contrary to popular belief, Toussaint didn't join the French because they banned slavery, in fact, the news of them doing so came a few months after as news took a while to reach Haiti, and it was mostly due to his deteriorating relationship with his fellow Haitian commanders under the Spanish, alongside the latter's barely concealed disdain of the slaves fighting with them.
