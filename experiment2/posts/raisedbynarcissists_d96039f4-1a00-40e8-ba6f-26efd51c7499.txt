"And what about your younger sibling?" Well, she transforms my room into a kpop shrine so...
I have left two months and a half ago. My little sister is my life, I never cared about anyone as much as I care for her. I was so scared to leave her alone with our parents, but she encouraged me to leave. However, in those two months, I have only seen her once and she barely responded to me. She even refused to help by bringing some of my stuffs or to help me get home to pack some (because I left with nothing after an awful argument who was too much) because she "didn't want to pick a side". That was hurtful, but she's the Golden Child so it was predictable...

Today I went to my parents' house while everyone was out to take some of my stuffs back, and I have discovered my room, that my sister promised me she would protect from my parents, transforms into a second bedroom for my sister, or, like I like to call it, a kpop shrine. I have nothing against kpop, but there was nothing left of my stuff there, apart from the thing that could benefit my sister (my funko pop, my manga...) I didn't have time to find my stuffs, like my art supplies, apart from a box that I couldn't get with me because it was too heavy. I did get all of my clothes and took some of the stuffs in my room my sister left, but not everything.

I also texted her, she responded really fast for once (most of the time, she never does), then she called me, and she is not ashamed. Something about it "not being my home anymore" and how she never saw me as her older sister, but she was doing it because she "missed me". Lol, she never talks to me but ok. I implied I was cutting contact with her.

I'm furious, but also extremely hurt. At least, I was able to see my cat and play with her.
