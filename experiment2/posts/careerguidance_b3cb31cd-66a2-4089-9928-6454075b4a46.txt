How do I negotiate my salary in a job interview? (And how much is a reasonable ask)
I am 25m, currently working at a environmental testing lab as a glorified shipping/receiving clerk. I've been in this position for only ~3 months now, but I want to leave. The work isn't difficult, just a bit boring. More importantly, there isn't any room for promotion or much hope of any meaningful raises. I make $15 an hour, but in the Chicago suburbs with the cheapest apartments going for $1100, its just not enough for me to live comfortably and make any meaningful contributions to my retirement savings. 

On a whim, I applied for a position at a global insurance and risk management firm where I worked extremely briefly over the summer on a two week contract. The position I applied for is a claims representative trainee, the ad listed no qualifications or experience needed as the position starts with a 6-9 month training period. Salary ranges I've found online say $27,000-$81,000. My target salary to start would be at least $40,000, is this unreasonably high for a new hire with no experience or relevant degree? I applied last Tuesday, got an email less than 12 hours later on Wednesday asking to set up a 30 minute "connect call" to share information, which is going to be this Thursday. If they decide they want to hire me what kind of salary should I aim for?
