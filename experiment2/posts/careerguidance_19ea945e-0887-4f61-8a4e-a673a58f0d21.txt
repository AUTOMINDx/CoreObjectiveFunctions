FAANG VS CYBERSECURITY: Which one?
Hi I am 37 years old. I have a bachelors degree in IT but never held an IT job. Looking to get back in the game by pursuing either iOS DEVELOPMENT or CYBERSECURITY. I can’t make up my mind. Going back to school is not an option.  Looking to get some advice from people on which career to choose. So tell me, which one do u have a passion for / what advice would u give to me to help me with making my choice.
