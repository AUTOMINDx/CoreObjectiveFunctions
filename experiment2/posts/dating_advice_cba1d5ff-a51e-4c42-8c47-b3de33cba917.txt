I made out with a girl on our first date, and she sent me a msg telling me she loved it, but asked if I could please wear chapstick because my dry lips hurt her
I (22M) am super super embarrassed after receiving this msg, and don’t know what to reply with because I didn’t notice it until she (21F) pointed it out. I think it’s due to the Canadian weather and the fact that I chew gum religiously and this dries out my lips even more
