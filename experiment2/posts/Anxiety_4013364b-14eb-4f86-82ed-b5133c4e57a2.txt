Feeling Overwhelmed?
It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

&amp;#x200B;

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.  

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep. 

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.  

**Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
   
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**
