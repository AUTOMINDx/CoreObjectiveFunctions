Should I be paid the extra half hour?
Not 100% sure what to flair this under so I hope this'll do. But basically my question is this. We've just had a new company take over our workplace, we used to be local, now we're a major company. Atm, we've got 3-4 shifts each. So i usually work 2-6. The problem is, they expect every person to count their individual till at the end of their shift. Which leaves me there for another half an hour to count the till. Now, this doesn't bother me too much im happy to stay an extra 30 minutes to do it, but the way I see it is if over 4 shifts that's an extra 2 hours, then I expect to be paid for it. But my manager has just told me that I'm not allowed to put the extra half hour in my time book since it is my responsibility to be out of there by 6. This doesn't work tho, since we're not even allowed to count it till I finish, which is at 6. My question is, should I be paid for the extra 30 minutes I work? I wouldn't care if it was once but since its everyday it ends up being 2-2.5 extra hours a week.
