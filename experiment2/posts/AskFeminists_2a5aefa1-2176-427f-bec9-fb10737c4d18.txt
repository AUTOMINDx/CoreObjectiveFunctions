Showing of boobs is empowering or not?
In the trailer of Licorice Pizza, there's a scene where Alana knocks on Gary's door and asks him if he really wants to see her boobs. Then she strips naked. My question is, can showing your boobs to a man empowering or not? Considering that the woman could be under the male gaze. I don't know why but I find the scene empowering. Please enlighten me.
