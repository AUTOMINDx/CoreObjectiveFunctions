Possible stroke?
Hey all as I said Male 32 approx 5’ 8” and 260 lbs I do have anxiety. I do smoke cigarettes and weed. 

So, for the last 2 years maybe more I’ve had an issue with my ears not popping. Usually I can deal with it (or at least I’ve grown accustomed to it I guess). I’m dizzy a lot and have issues with being “spacey”...

The other day I experienced something terrifying and honestly haven’t been the same since. 

I was on my phone scrolling through some social media site and noticed that my vision seemed off. As I’ve said I get dizzy at times with my ears being plugged but it wasn’t that. I thought my glasses might have been smudged but when I took them off the feeling continued then got worse. I had an episode of some sort where all I could see was jagged, static like lines in both my eyes and I got super anxious and dizzy. After a bit it went away but I was completely disoriented and felt so anxious. No headache. I did feel like i had a bit of trouble finding my words but my partner said I wasn’t slurring. 

Since then I’ve just had an insane amount of anxiety, very lethargic, and I’m still having some sort of issue with my vision. It’s not blurry and I’m not seeing double but it’s definitely off in some way. I am just concerned as I’ve never had this issue and it’s really affecting me the last few days in a bad way.  Any advice? Thanks ahead of time
