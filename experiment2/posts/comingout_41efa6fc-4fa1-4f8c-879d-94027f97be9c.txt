I'm in a Hetero relationship and questioning my sexuality. Please Help!
Hello,

This is my first post on here so sorry if it's a bit long. I'm a 25 year old guy who has been in a relationship with a girl for coming up to 4 years. I am openly bisexual and my girlfriend is incredibly supportive of this. However, recently I have been having feelings that I might be gay.

My girlfriend is so kind and caring and I really do love her which is why I am really confused as to what to do. I'm worried that if I explain this to her and then we do split up, and I realise that I am bisexual still, I will have wasted such a wonderful relationship. However, I can't get the feeling out of my head that I might be gay. I have often questioned whether I am gay a few times before but the past few months, it has been really strong. I often watch gay porn and fantasize about being with a man, but I don't know if this is because I am bisexual.

My coming out as bisexual was a bit of a disaster to be honest, and it was met with a lot of animosity from people close to me (but I also had very supportive friends too). Because of this I never really got much of an opportunity to explore my feelings with a male because I was so terrified and wary about what others what think of me (although I have had a sexual experience with a man). So I'm not sure if I am just curious or if it is because I am gay.

I just really don't know the best way to approach this and any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
