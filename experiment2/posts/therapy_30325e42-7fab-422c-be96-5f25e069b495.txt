A violent rage I need to talk about.
So I've been having a really horrible month, ranging from a close family death, to not getting paid my time off, to not getting paid for quarantining, to a whole myriad of other things all within the past 27 days. 


But for some reason, when my girlfriend was talking about how she ate cereal and had some water, I assumed that she used water instead of milk in her cereal. I don't know why, I have never had this sudden urge before, but the knowledge of her using water in her cereal instead of milk made me so violently angry I wanted to fight her. 


I don't know maybe it's becuase of my OCD due to my Autism and ADHD, I can be very my way or the highway when it comes to certain things (I'm working on that.) But the knowledge of someone, ANYONE using water instead of milk just makes me violently angry. 

What the fuck is going on?


P.S. Before anyone asks, no I did not hit her. No I have never hit her. She saw my serious face and she corrected that the cereal was not in the water and we laughed about it.
