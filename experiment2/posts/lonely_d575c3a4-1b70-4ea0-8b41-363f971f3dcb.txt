My ex has a new boyfriend and I'm dying alone
My ex girlfriend broke up with me one month ago. She destroyed me so bad that I can't fucking breath and eat anymore. Today I just discovered that she is with another guy while I'm dying alone. I just can't keep living like this, I can't live my best life without her. I'm making this pain stop forever. Sorry guys, she has won and I'm going to abandon this fucking lonely and useless life forever. I don't want to cry anymore while she is laughing. At least I hope that in hell there won't be the need to cry. Sorry, I'm over it, I surrender.
