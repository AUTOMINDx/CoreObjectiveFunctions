How do I get my girlfriend to feel beautiful again 28(M) 29(F)
I tell her all the time how she's sexy, beautiful, and funny. she wants to lose weight and i'm sure that's a factor in how she feels. I can't much help that but I give her positive affirmations often. We had a daughter 2 years ago and she's been struggling with her image ever since. I feel it is ruining our sex life and I have a high sex drive already while hers was already kinda low. Sex aside I don't want her feeling down about herself the way she does now. Can any ladies give any suggestions that are maybe rare or uncommon? What has helped you if you've felt this way?
