How to get rid of upper lip hair and upper lip hair shadow ?
I’ve been waxing my upper lip for a few years and about a year or maybe 2 years ago I noticed an upper lip shadow. I use sally Hansen wax strips and a few days after i can’t really see the shadow too much but as the days go on i start to see it more. When I look closely with a flashlight I see little stubble hair could that be causing the shadow ? Would plucking all those hairs help? I was thinking about getting a facial epilator or trying laser hair removal for it. Has anyone tried them ? Would it help ? I have more of an olive skin tone and my hair grows in dark so I think that makes it more noticeable.
