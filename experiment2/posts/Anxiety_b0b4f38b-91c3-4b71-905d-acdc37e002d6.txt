Stressing myself out
I'm stressing out about how I'm 25 and have never been to college and if I do go I'll graduate at 30 in a classroom surrounded by teenagers. I didn't go because my social anxiety was so bad I almost flunked out of HS. My skill set and work experience in my field I'd limited and makes me useless if I got let go from my company and I'd do no longer be able to support myself financially. 

Meanwhile I moved out on my own in August and have a PILE of my deceased father's electronics that I want to sort through and save on a hard drive so I don't have excess dvds/computers/laptops lying around. I told myself I'd do it before the end of the year but I can't manage to get myself to do it. It takes up space in my room and stresses me out.

I struggle with adult acne. My topical medication isn't working well anymore I'm afraid to take accutane. Because of this my self esteem is low and ruining any potential dates I want to go on. I always have to cancel because I look a wreck. I'm 25 and have NO dating experience whatsoever. I got invited to a bar and panicked because I've never been. The older I get the weirder I'm gonna be for being so inexperienced. 

I wanted to take therapy for my social anxiety but none of the virtual therapists seem to be getting back to me. 

My diet is terrible. I either eat like a pig or don't eat at all because I don't know what I want to eat. My body feels the weakest it's ever been. I want to go to the gym but I don't know what I'm doing and overthink everything. How many reps? Is my form right? What do I eat afterwards? Am I wasting my time? Getting a trainer is too expensive at the moment. Everything is just piling on me.
