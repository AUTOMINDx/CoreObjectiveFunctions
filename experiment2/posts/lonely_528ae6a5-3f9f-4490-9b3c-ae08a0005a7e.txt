I kinda wanna end it but I also don’t want to
I feel so empty. No one seems to know about it and I don’t think anyone actually cares. Why would they ? It’s not like I don’t have friend, like with everything I have I should be so fucking happy. But there’s just nothing in there. The only person I like is way out of my league and I wasn’t even able to wish her happy birthday. She doesn’t care about me either.
