My wife is leaving
My wife of 4 years is leaving me. She said that with the constant arguing and different expectations of each other, it just isnt working out. I am devastated, we talked about continuing to try and she just doesn't want to. She said she has never been able to be herself between her parents emotionally abusing her, and our different lifestyles. My daughter is 3 in a half, and doesn't understand but knows we are both hurting and has been quietly observing. We told her mommy and daddy are going to live in different houses, but we still love her very much. My wife doesn't want child support, or any assets, she just needs to seperate. She said she still loves me very much and will always love me, but just isn't in love with me.... part of me hopes time away will heal her. But I am trying to respect her space. I also am not from where we live and I have no family that lives here and no one to fall back on, but my wife said she will support me both emotionally and fiscally if need be. I need advice and kind words, or just honesty.
