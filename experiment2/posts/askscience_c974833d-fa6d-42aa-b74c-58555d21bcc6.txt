When they talk about mutations “escaping” vaccine protection, is it a sliding scale or all-or-nothing?
I kept hearing that this Omicron variant has the potential to escape vaccine protection, and the word escape to me implies completely avoid it. Is that what escape means in this context, or does escape mean that it reduces but doesn’t nullify the protection of vaccines?/r/
