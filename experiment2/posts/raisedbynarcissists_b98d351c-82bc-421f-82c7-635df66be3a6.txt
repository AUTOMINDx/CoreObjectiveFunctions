My mom just died &amp; my stepdad still can't see what a narcissist he is.
I am beyond disgusted in my stepdads behavior right now. I'm 20, my little sister is 17. Our mom just died. 

(edited for clarification) 

My stepdad was married to her for 12 years. They divorced in 2013. I went to live with my grandparents and mom because I wasn't his biological kid but he kept my little sister and we only saw each other once every 3 months. Despite this, I still consider him a dad to me because he was for a long time.

Well he invited my sister and I on a vacation after our mom's service because he knows this is hard on us. However, he found out that I've been talking to my biological dad about the funeral and he flipped his shit.

My stepdad has VERY fragile masculinity. He tried to fight my biological dad multiple times when dropping me off for visits as a kid. I guess he was under the impression that I cut him off when I turned 18. For reference, both my biological dad and stepdad are narcissistic assholes, but my biodad seems to be doing A LOT better in this situation. He even asked if my stepdad was doing alright, which shocked me. 

I'm really hurt by my stepdads behavior about this. He called me and cussed me out this morning, calling me a bastard kid who's just using him for his money to go on vacation. He said that I needed to choose which dad I'm loyal to stick with it. 

Like what the fuck? I'm seriously about to say fuck the trip. This is such a hard time right now and he has the AUDACITY to start an argument and call me a bastard. Normally, I would kiss ass and say "I'm so sorry!!" a million times to make him feel better. But I don't think I can right now. This is disgusting behavior.
