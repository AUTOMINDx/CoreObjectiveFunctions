Perpetual job hunt
Until this year, I had not job hunted for a decade. I wasn’t necessarily happy with my job. Should I be on a continuous job hunt—searching, networking, taking calls, applying—even if I’m content? 

There’s no one answer but I just remember how hard it was to get started and now it’s kinda like a habit.
