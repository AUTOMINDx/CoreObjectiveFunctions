Making Bar At Bottom of Page Disappear
Exactly as the question states. I don't want the bar at the bottom of the page to be present as it often blocks some of what the professor writes. It's the one that states the number of participants, gives the share screen and record options, etc. I'd attach an image but apparently that's banned by this subreddit.
