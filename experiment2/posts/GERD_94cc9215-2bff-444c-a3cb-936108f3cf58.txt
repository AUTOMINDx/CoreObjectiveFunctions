Racing Heart After Eating?
Does anyone else get a racing heart after eating? It’s been happening every morning after breakfast for me, and sometimes lunch. All the other times I eat it’s okay. 

I checked my watch and my BPM is like 137 right now. I don’t feel any other symptoms besides some throat tightness. 

Does anyone else get a racing heart after eating, and do you know why this happens?
