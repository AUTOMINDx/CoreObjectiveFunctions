"I wanna go home..." but home isn't a place, it's a feeling. And it's fleeting.
Home is the feeling when I'm cuddling my boyfriend or having sex with him, when everything feels right in the world and in my body.

Home is the feeling when I'm with a friend and laughing my ass off at some dumb but genuine thing they said.

Home is the feeling when I'm out at a club or concert and there's no me, there's no identity, my body is one with the music, my dance.

Home is the feeling when I'm out in nature, staring up at a tree that's seen hundreds of years and thousands of people before me.

I keep chasing that feeling. Sometimes it's healing. Sometimes it's escapism. There are so many anxious parts and dissociated parts locked up in my body.

Someday I'm going to make my body and brain my home.
