How to tell my very religious mother I F(22) am going to move in with my boyfriend?
Hi f(22) here. 
I’m trying to find ways to break the news to my very conservative mom that I’m planning on moving in with my Boyfriend of 2 years. I live in a very crowded home with my three younger siblings (I am the oldest of 4). My parents are separated and my mom lives at our family home with us. Our parents our constantly fighting and it has been a battle between them all of my life. My father was abusive in the past and still has control over all my families finances. 
However, I am completely independent and handle all my finances separately including health, credit, school, car etc. 
My mom is depressed and has always been a stay at home mom taking care of us. My dad has broken her down and she is a shell of her old self. In this process she has become jaded and defensive. While she is hurting badly and has been for a long time, she still keeps to her traditionally religious values and has always been incredibly expectant of me. She has such high standards when it comes to me. And many ways I try to live my life are sinful and shameful according to her. 
I am trying to create a life for myself while still struggling to overcome my toxic home life. I have always been a role model to my siblings and helped them with homework and shopping and groceries whenever they need it. I need to look out for me and my future now that I’m 22 and I am worried sick. 
I am just trying to find a way that is least painful and guilty to share that I am planning on moving in with my boyfriend with my extremely religious mother. 
My boyfriend is incredibly supportive and my mom Likes him a lot and is always kind to him  but barely acknowledges his existence because of her depression. 
I would so appreciate any guidance.
Thank you
