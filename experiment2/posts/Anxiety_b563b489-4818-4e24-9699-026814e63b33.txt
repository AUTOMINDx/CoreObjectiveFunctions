Anyone else constantly worried about having a psychotic break?
Had a family situation happen over thanksgiving and with the stress of finals I’m constantly feeling frantic and stressed, my body is reacting poorly and I’m not sleeping well, I feel exhausted but so stressed I can’t rest. I’m terrified I’m going to have a psychotic break, what do I do?
