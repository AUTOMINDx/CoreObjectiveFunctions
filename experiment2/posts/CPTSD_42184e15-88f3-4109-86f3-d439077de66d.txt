It's so hard to get love/sex as a male lacking confidence
Yet I know those things would probably make me much more confident, and also more well-being in general

Why am I alive? I struggled my entire life to escape my "family", and now that I miraculously managed to do it, my only price is loneliness.

Sure, it is better than constant fear, but it's still not a state worth living in.

I never ever got any help. Yet I had to give up my childhood, my adolescence and my 20's. Just to survive.

Now I have to work extra hard to make up for the time I missed. And I still get no help. At all. Ever.

I'm so proud for that most hurt little boy, who endured more than any person should be able to, let alone a child. Yet I'm also hurt because he still, as an adult, has yet to get any meaningful relief.

So far he has suffered for nothing.

Edit:
I'm a little caught off guard by both the volume and the thoughtfulness of all you wonderful people's comments. Thank you. This sense of camaraderie is a light in the darkness.

Fuck you darkness. I'll get your ass
