[Batman] What kind of eye makeup does Batman wear?
The Batman (2022) seems to be the first batman movie to acknowledge he does wear eye makeup even though every other movie batman has had to wear it. So what kind does he use? Is it his own blend or does he buy commercial and what special attributes does it need for his purposes?
