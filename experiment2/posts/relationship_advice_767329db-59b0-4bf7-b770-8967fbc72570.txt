Found porn on my wife’s phone.
So I don’t really know where else do go with this so here goes nothing Reddit strangers. 

My (33) wife (34) and I have had relationship issues for a while. We’re still together and love each other but there’s a lot of issues with our relationship. This has caused a major lack of sex. We haven’t had sex in close to a year. I’ve tried to initiate at times but she’s always tired or some other excuse. Lately I stopped even trying. 

So I went to shower today and noticed my wife left her phone in the bathroom. For some reason I decided to pick it up and look at her browsing history. I searched for porn on a whim and was very surprised. 

This month she visited porn sites like 5 different times and it had some really hardcore stuff on it. There was a pattern of anal squirting videos. Some with DP. Some with 2 girls and a guy. 

I don’t know why but I always assumed she just didn’t have a sex drive after we had our kids. But clearly there’s something there. I would love to be able to act out her fantasies with her. 

Not sure how to bring this up to her or if I should even tell her. It was definitely a violation of trust to go through it. But now that I did I want to say something to her. 

Im not mad or jealous or anything. Actually very turned on by this. Just want to know a way to turn this around to help us get back into a healthy sex life. We’ve always been super vanilla with sex and clearly her history suggests she has a wilder side. 

Sorry for the verbal diarrhea. Curious what you guys or girls think is the right this to do.
