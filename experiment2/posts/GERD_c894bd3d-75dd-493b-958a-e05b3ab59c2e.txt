What did you eat during your 24hr pH study?
My gastro said to ideally eat trigger foods during the study combined with periods of rest which makes sense to me. I'm seeing this as a day of indulgence (silver lining) even though I know it will be unpleasant and difficult to eat on the actual day but I'm going to try and power through. What meals did you have?
