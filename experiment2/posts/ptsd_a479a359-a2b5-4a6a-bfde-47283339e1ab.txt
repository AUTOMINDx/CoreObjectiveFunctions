Need help, but too scared to get it... not sure what to do
First of all, I don't know if I have PTSD, I just didn't know where else to ask for advice and this is the closest place I can find. I have a lot of the symptoms but the thing that happened to me wasn't related to violence, or death, or anything, it was just something that happened, so I'm not sure if it's the same. 

Anyway. About 3 years ago something happened to me I don't want to go into detail about, it turned me into a wreck for months, but I kind of managed to figure it out for a while and do okay for myself. A few weeks ago I was telling one of my friends about it for the first time, not sure why I thought it was a good idea, and talking about it too much, just made me feel like I was back there, and ever since then I've been having multiple panic attacks every time I remember it and the effects it has had on me, I can't really function. It's taking over my life.

The problem is I'm a university student, and I really need help from my professors to get through school right now... the problem is they won't give you accommodations or help unless you have medical documentation from a doctor, or proof you're talking to a therapist. And I'm just terrified because the situation that happened a few years ago that made me like this was because of a psychologist. I'm really scared to try to talk to one again, if the same thing happens again I don't know what I'd do. I don't trust doctors or therapists anymore. I know it's irrational but I'm just absolutely terrified of them. But I need them if I want to get help or get better.

Sorry for the vent. I just was hoping for some advice, or maybe some comforting words. I'm feeling really stuck and scared.
