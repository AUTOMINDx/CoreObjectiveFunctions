Should I get a Letter of Recommendation from the Head of Department or an ex-Assistant Professor?
Hi everyone. I'm applying for Masters in Computer Science in US Universities for Fall 2022. I was wondering whether it would be a better idea to get a letter of recommendation from the head of my department under whom I have studied one subject or from an assistant professor who has since moved to another university under whom Iâ€™ve done significant projects and research, other than getting the highest marks in the class in his subject.

If I should get it from the latter, would it be okay that he is not affiliated to my university anymore? And would I have to mention his old email address pertaining to our university or the new email address from his new university?
