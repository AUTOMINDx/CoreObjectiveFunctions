I can’t watch videos where animals might get hurt but I also don’t mind videos where there is graphic content/violence or major injuries caused to humans by humans?
I feel super empathetic towards animals and I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about a video where an animal might get hurt (even in a natural context like where natural predators catch naturals hunted animals) but I literally don’t give half a shit watching people get hurt / permanently injured / gore etc.
Is there something wrong with me? Is it normal to not feel empathy towards human but only towards animals?
I’m asking this because I got into an argument and got shunned over my opinion so I’m hoping for some feedback.
