AITA for wanting to spend some time with my friend without her dog?
My (27F) friend (23F) recently got herself a dog after years of wanting one. I have no issue with the dog as I also love this dog and appreciate she’s happy being a dog parent finally. However I’ve noticed my friend has become overly attached to her dog. She won’t leave her house without her. At first this was very sweet and I enjoyed the animal company however recently I’m feeling overshadowed and can’t spend quality time with my friend because she’s always distracted… 

Whenever we go out for dinner she insists we go to the same places that are dog friendly and once there if I’m talking she completely ignores me and is talking to her dog, wandering off when I’m in the middle of speaking because her dog wants to say hello to a nearby table and I’m left awkwardly waiting. I had some great job news I wanted to share with her but she cut me off and started talking about some new items she bought her dog recently and then excused herself to take her dog out to the toilet. I feel like an asshole for wanting to spend some quality time without her dog for once but I’m not sure how to voice that because I know she loves her dog and I don’t want to upset her.
