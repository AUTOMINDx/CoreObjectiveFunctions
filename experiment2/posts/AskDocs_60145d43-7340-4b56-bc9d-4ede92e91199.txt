Frequent use of peptobismol
Hi, I’m 27m 5’8 165lb. So I am taking zoloft for anxiety. The root is my anxiety is that when i go out I worry i will poop my pants or have troubles finding restroom. My anxiety also gave me stomach ache. The zoloft has been working, but the thing is I have my regular morning poop, but then I have to do once or twice more poops and the stool usually have lots of mucus. I have been taking peptobismol for it and it also seems to help my anxiety. My question is, is there any severe harm from frequent take of peptobismol? I only take 1 dose a day in the morning.
