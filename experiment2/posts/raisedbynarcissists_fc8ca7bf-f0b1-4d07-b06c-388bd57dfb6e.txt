It’s happening! I’m leaving!
I (22F) made a post earlier today about deciding if I should move back to my hometown or not. My nMom is where I live now, and she desperately does not want me to move away from her. She’s been trying to convince me not to for a week. 

I got a call today from a family member who let me know I can come stay with them as long as I need, and I can bring my cats to stay there with me. My dad is coming to help me move on the 18th. It’s all actually happening

I am getting away from my nMom, hours away. I’m going back to my loving and supporting family. 

I’ve been full of guilt and shame during all of this, sitting in the shower crying a few times a day. I feel like I’ve been on a bad acid trip for a week, like it’s inescapable. I’m feeling very anxious and scared. My nMom has been telling me things like “you’ll just get stuck there”, “you’ll never see your family anyways, they’re always busy”, “you’ll hate it there”, “how will you be away from *me* ?”  These things have been replaying in my head, trying to convince me that I’m doing the wrong thing. 

I just wanna be excited! But I am terrified. I’ve called 3 family members and a friend today and that has helped. I’m actually really proud of myself for being able to do that, I’ve been so shut off for years. I guess it’s nice to actually feel all of this stuff even if they are bad feelings, I don’t feel numb anymore. I’m closer to healing than I’ve ever been 

I haven’t told nMom that the date is set, mere weeks from now. I am actually terrified to tell her, and the guilt of leaving her is almost unbearable. I’m trying very hard to keep my sanity. This is one of the hardest things i’ve ever been through.
