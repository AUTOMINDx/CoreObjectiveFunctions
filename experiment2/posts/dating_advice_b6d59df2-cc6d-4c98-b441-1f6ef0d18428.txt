should i stop hoping to be in love someday ?
there is nothing good in my life but i feel like loving someone and feeling loved would make me happy. The problem is that I don't know how to dress well like people of my age, I consider myself ugly even though my friends tell me I'm not, I'm also bad at literally everything I do and my only one "talent" is being able to make the sounds of minecraft mobs and angry birds. Im also really shy so it dont help. Last time i loved someone was nearly 7 years ago. People around me are in relations ships or at least they have crushs but not me.

so does love really comes naturally ? because someone told me that running after love is useless but its the last thing i want to know
