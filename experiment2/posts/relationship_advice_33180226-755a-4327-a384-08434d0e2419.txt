My (29F) fiancé (27M) goes upstairs to masturbate as soon as he’s home from work
It’s not uncommon for him to just get home from work, briefly kiss me, and then say he’s going to go upstairs to our office to work on a script. Every time he goes into the office, he shuts and locks the door claiming that he just likes the privacy. 

Today is one of those days. He’d only been up there for maybe 5 minutes when I went up to ask him what we should do for dinner. I knocked, waited for a decent bit of time wondering if I needed to knock louder before he finally answered the door. Computer screen is on a blank Google search, not the script. Quick glance down and it’s very apparent he has an erection under his jeans. This isn’t the first time I’ve caught him in this way.

I have no issue with his masturbating (I would prefer he do it when I’m not home but as I work from home and typically run errands during the day while he’s gone, there’s not much time when he’s home that I’m not). Porn use I have mixed thoughts on due to issues we had early on in our relationship… the big issue I have with this is the choice to lock himself away as soon as he gets home instead of having quality time or intimate time with me. Especially when just this morning, I drove him to work and he said how he likes when I drive him so we can spend as much time together as possible in the morning. 

Any thoughts? Advice on how to approach this?
