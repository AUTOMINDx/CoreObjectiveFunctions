Worried about an even worse pandemic
While the current pandemic has certainly thrown me out of whack, there's another virus I recently found out about that really puts all that into shade. I've seen multiple articles about the Nipah virus, found in south and south-east Asia, about it having a good possibility of becoming a new pandemic. This is particularly worrying to me, because it has a VERY high death rate, around 50-75%. If this sort of thing became as transmissible as COVID it would be truly devastating. I keep trying to tell myself that if a highly transmissible form of this emerged it would be contained quickly and that there would be much less willingness to take chances with such a deadly disease. I used to have faith in such a response, looking at how successfully SARS was handled, but the dismal failure at containing COVID early last year and the number of people who fail to comply to even the most basic public health measures has given me a really poor outlook at the prospects of this working out. I thought we were living in an age far removed from the middle ages. I just feel so helpless.
