Does Earth have a neutrino core?
With neutrinos only interacting with gravity and weak force, shouldn't they accumulate in the core of the earth where gravity is at its strongest? I get that they only interact very weakly with gravity, and that they typically travel at relativistic speed - is there any way for them to slow down enough to actually accumulate in this fashion - tiny as though this core might be?
