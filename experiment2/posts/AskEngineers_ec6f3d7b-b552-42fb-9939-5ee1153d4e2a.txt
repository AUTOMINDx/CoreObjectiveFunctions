Do I need to change my trucks engines oil early to remove shavings or is that a thing of the past?
So over the years I’ve heard both sides of the argument, but on a new car engine, does the oil need to be changed early to remove shavings? I’m sure engine designs and oil filters have gotten better with time so I can see why that may be a thing of the past.
