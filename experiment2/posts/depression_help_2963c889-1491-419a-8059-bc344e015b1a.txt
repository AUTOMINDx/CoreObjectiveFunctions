How do I hide my depression better?
I don’t really have a lot of friends. I don’t have money for a therapist. My issues are way too complicated for the free therapists in my town (students that provide therapy under supervision). My best friend has said it’s a burden to hear about depressive thoughts all the time, so I stopped talking to them about it. Now my partner has asked me to “fake it” and says that that will make it better. So how do I hide my depression better? I know it won’t go away, but I just want to keep it in so that other people like my partner, best friend, and kids don’t have to be burdened with my depression. I don’t want them to have to deal with it anymore. So I how do I be a good partner, friend, and parent, and stop letting my depression impact those around me? All I hear is that you’re supposed to talk about it and that will make it better, but it’s not. I’ve done therapy (the free kind that’s available to me) for years and I’m still depressed and now those that are closest to me are tired of me talking about it, so I need to be able to hold it in better.
