What to do next
For the past few months, I’ve finally been trying to take control of my acid reflux and get the proper help for it main do to my fast teeth decay. I’ve had a EGD (if I abbreviated that right) done and was put in Omeprazole to see what would happen. After no difference I started taking Sucralfate too to help with the erosion and tried to get a prescription of Dexilant but could do to my cheap ass insurance. With no other solutions my doctor suggested a life style change with I didn’t stick with long and would prefer to not have to follow due to its many limitations. So at this point I’m stuck with the same old symptoms I’ve always had and no actually solutions and I just don’t know what the next step should be. Are there other PPIs that may help that are also affordable or should I try a H2 blocker? I’ve already considered surgery because and am willing to do it but after all of these sudden medical bills popped up after my operation and doctors visits I’m just too broke rn to go that route. What’s y’all’s suggestion?
