How to network and find mentors in science?
Hi all, I was recommended to ask this in this sub.

I am doing a gap year (UK 18M) and will be going on to study Physics. My intention being to work in the Nuclear Physics sector.

I believe this is the prime time to network as it will open up opportunities for work experience during holidays in uni but I'm not sure the procedure behind contacting current nuclear physicists.

My initial idea was to just look for relevant companies and look for contact info on the websites but I'm not sure of there are dedicated resources for this sort of thing!

I would love any advise on the topic, I do hope this is sub appropriate if not I will delete the post!
