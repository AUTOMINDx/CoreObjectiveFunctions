How to get design experience out with my main engineering job that will be accepted professionally if I applied for an engineering job in future
First time posting on reddit so apologies if this in the wrong place etc.

I studied mechanical engineering at university and I have just finished a 2 year graduate scheme working as a project engineer on diagnostics for a large experiment. This has been a very interesting role and I now have experience in project management etc. however I have not been able to do much actual design, so not cad or calculations/analysis which were things that enjoyed/was quite good at while I was studying.

I am now moving to another job which is also as a project engineer but it apparently includes some design that will be fed through to design engineers to detail up in CAD etc.

My question is I would like to get experience in doing design/analysis work but it seems for the foreseeable future that will not happen during my day job as that is going down the rout of project engineering. What would be accepted by employers in the future if I were to apply for a job that was more design focussed than project engineering other than simply reading about manufacturing techniques, materials and CAD?

Happy to clarify anything if it helps
