What is the optimal policy for strategic industries?
Economists generally frown upon protectionism because of the inefficiencies and deadweight loss it creates. However, some industries are vital for national defense capability. They provide an intangible economic benefit to a nation that is not reflected in prices. In the event of a war, production capacity in these industries can be shifted for wartime production. Examples include:

* Steel and other metals
* Automotive and other manufacturing
* Aircraft manufacturing
* Shipbuilding
* Merchant marine
* Semiconductors

How should economists take strategic value into account when calculating possible trade benefits?
