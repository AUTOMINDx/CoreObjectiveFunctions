How can I sleep better when sharing the bed with my gf?
Whenever my girlfriend sleeps over, I’m lucky to sleep 75% as good as I do when she’s not in bed with me. I don’t know why. I’m currently in the living room after I spent 90 minutes staring at the ceiling trying to fall asleep. I tried meditating, relaxing every muscle in my body from the toes to my head and doing breathing exercises. I tried imagining myself doing a repetitive task, nothing. 

We use separate blankets because she would steal the blanket all the time. I feel like I have enough room, but for some reason I’m just always restless when she’s in bed.
