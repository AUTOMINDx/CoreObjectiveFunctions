I left my apartment to save my life.
Me and my husband got into an argument while I was explaining that I was severely depressed. He left for the night to who knows where (he says a hotel his brothers assured me he was with someone else and he was planning all of this) and he has a gun in the apartment. To make the story short, I thought about it but ended up just leaving the apartment.

After talking back and forth, we decided we would t leave together until we found no help. It’s been a month… I’m still homeless, no car, and I’m staying with a friend that can’t keep me here for long. It’s an hour and a half away from where I live and since I have no transportation, I lost my job and have been trying to find a new one…
I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being punished. 😢 
Now I got him help. But I can’t go home cause I haven’t found help for myself… this is SO fucked!!!! 😭 
I can’t stop crying and freaking out. 
The worst part is not even all the material things I’m lacking but the effort I put to come to this country, me be all the way here to end up broken-hearted and homeless… I saw this coming and I told him: if we were ever to break up, your life continues as it always has. But me? I have nowhere to go. I’ll be fucked…” here’s me living what I told him I would. 

I have these bright ideas where maybe today is the day I’ll just give up. 
Not necessarily because of him. But because I can’t trust anyone. Not him nor me or anyone else I’ve ever met.  People always want something and then throw you away like a used rag…. 

If I have to spend Christmas alone…. 😔 
I cannot… I can’t deal… why is it so hard for people to LOVE me?!?!?! It’s not fair!
