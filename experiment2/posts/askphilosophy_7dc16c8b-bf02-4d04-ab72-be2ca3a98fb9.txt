On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense and Objective Truth
In regards to the particular section that states:

 It is even a difficult thing for him to admit to himself that the insect or the bird perceives an entirely different world from the one that man does, and that the question of which of these perceptions of the world is more correct is quite meaningless, for this would have to have been decided previously in accordance with the criterion of the correct perception, which means, in accordance with a criterion which is not available. But in any case it seems to me that “the correct perception” — which would mean “the adequate expression of an object in the subject” — is a contradictory impossibility.

It appears to me that Nietzsche is denying the existence of objective truth here? But that seems unlikely because if there was no objective truth, then what are the original entities, the essence of things, that he speaks of us being unable to grasp? In order for us to fail to adequately articulate something in language, something correct has to exist, right? Is the criterion of correct perception different from objective truth or the essence of things in some sense? 

I have gone wrong in my understanding of this text somewhere, but I can't pinpoint where and I have been awake for too long. I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out here!
