coping with waiting
hi everyone, ive got a few conditions and they're stopping me from doing things because I'm worried about being ill/in pain during plans and I'm struggling. it feels like it's relentless, after the lockdowns i was too anxious to make plans and was waiting for that to calm, then felt okay and my IBS was flaring up so I was waiting for that to pass, thought right i need to push through i can't do this anymore and was finally about to make plans when back pain popped up 2 months ago which hasn't budged since, finally seemed to maybe get slightly better then bam, neck pain has cropped up a few days ago that I can't get rid of and keeps me up at night. I'm in the process of being seen by drs but there's lots of waiting and in the meantime I'm stuck. it just feels relentless, like I'm finally about to start living my life then something else happens and I'm back to waiting.

 I don't think I can wait anymore though, ive seen friends twice in the past year and I'm only 23. does anyone have any advice or tips for surviving waiting/making plans or just anything really, please. I'm at a loss to be honest, I don't know what to do for the best, I'm scared of having an ibs flare while with people and my back hurts all the time, my best option is alternating between sitting and walking every half hour and even that doesn't get rid of it, but that's difficult to do when trying to socialise or whatever. I just don't know what to do, this has all suddenly happened in the space of the past 6 months and its impacting my mental health. it's the back pain mostly, I could sort of cope with my ibs. if you've read this far, thank you
