Did standard oil engage in predatory pricing? I have heard a number of conflicting accounts on this front. Recently started reading "Triumph of Conservatism" by Gabriel Kolko and have read elsewhere that this claim has been disputed. What is the actual story here of the big oil trusts?
More generally what is your take on Kolko's book
