Would you say the Industrial Revolution was made by Catholics or by Protestants?
I just heard a guy (history teacher but a supporter of Hispanism) saying that the Max Weber claim (that allegedly says it was the Protestant religion that was the spirit of entrepeneurship that drove and made possible the Industrial Revolution) is wrong because the Industrial Revolution was actually made/ carried out by Catholic Europe.

What are your thoughts?
