30 Minute Breaks as a Minor
Recently a co worker told me that I should have one 30 minute break a day. Since I work 5 hours, they already give me a 15 minute break for the past month I have worked. I looked this up first and it reads for my state of Ohio “More than 5 consecutive hours of work without a 30 minute rest period.” I went first to my supervisor and they said to go ask hr and they said I was not eligible since I am only working 5 hours not any more. I will be changing my hours next month I either 5 and half hours or less than 5 haven’t decided. Are they correct? Is it worth fighting? I don’t think it’s that big of a deal kinda just feel that they are cheating me since I’m working one minute less. Even though I always end up working more than 5 hours.
