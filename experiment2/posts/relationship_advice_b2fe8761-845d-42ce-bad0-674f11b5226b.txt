Divorced Father. Feeling guilty for living out of state and only seeing kids during summers and on video calls.
I mainly want to know, should I move back to the state my kids are in so I can be with them every other week even though it'll mean I have to get divorced from my new spouse?

My partner's family is all in Texas, where I moved to be with him. 

At first, I felt confident in my decision to move to a different state to be with him because he's the most incredible man. 

They live with me during the summers and I video chat with them at least 5x a week for 30 minutes before bedtime.

But I feel guilty and unsure about whether or not me moving to Texas is what's best for my kids. 

Unfortunately, my partner has been upfront from the beginning about not wanting to move to my home state of South Dakota so if I were to move back it'd mean the end of our marriage. 

I don't want to make a decision out of guilt but the guilt is almost unbearable. 

I guess I need to know:

Will they be OK with the just living with me during the summers and video chatting me?

Or will they be better off if I move back even though it'll mean I'd be divorced for a second time?
