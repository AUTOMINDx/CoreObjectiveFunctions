Could we protect buildings from solar flares or CME's with large faraday cages?
I've been reading some things about how solar flares could seriously mess up our society thanks to our reliance on electricity. I've also read that Faraday cages can stop some amount of EMP, if it isn't too big.

Given that buying spares of equipment or reinforcing everything would cost loads, why not just make important buildings into large Faraday cages?
