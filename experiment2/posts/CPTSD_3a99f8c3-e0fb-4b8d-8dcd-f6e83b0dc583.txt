Why is Body Awareness so Hard?
Note: I'm also an ADHDer, I'm sure that's part of it too.

Body awareness is something I've been thinking about since starting counseling about a month ago. I've known for years now that I lack body awareness, but now that I'm trying to pay attention it strikes me how out of touch I really am with my body. Quite frankly, just writing "my body" felt weird because I've always felt more like a "mind," if that makes sense. It gets weirder because logically, I know that this is a false dichotomy, but the separation often feels real. And then that's only one separation, even my mind feels fragmented (not in a psychotic way, or even a DID way...it's just easier to explain things in parts?).
