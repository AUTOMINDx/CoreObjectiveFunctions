How do I politely but firmly ask recommenders to submit letters by the deadline?
So my grad school application is due December 1st (less than 3 days) and a couple teachers have agreed to write me letters of recommendation but still have yet to submit them and I'm getting a little anxious \*stress\* haha. Thanks for your help and perspectives!
