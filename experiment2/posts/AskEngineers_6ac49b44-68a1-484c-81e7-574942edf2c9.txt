Do you have to stick to one specialization your whole life?
So once you graduate and get your first job which specializes in specific area like power (if electrical engineering) and you gain 5+ years experience in it, is that all you are really qualified to work in for the rest of your life? What happens if you want to change to other specializations like electronics or RF etc.? Does having a degree allow you to switch or not?
