How could I create more authentic friendships?
I have the feeling that I'm never really friends with people who I genuinely like, they always seem to have a wrong picture of me...it's most likely my fault since I always nod along and never express my actual opinions though. 

It may sound like I'm an asshole, but I want to stop, I want to be friends with people I actually enjoy being around with.

How is that done though? Reading the room and humour aren't my strengths at all and I have a stutter. Entirely speaking out my mind probably wouldn't be good, furthermore, I got a bad habit of lying.

I don't know where to begin. It feels like I'll start being inauthentic all over again.

(as a point of reference, I'm still at hs)
