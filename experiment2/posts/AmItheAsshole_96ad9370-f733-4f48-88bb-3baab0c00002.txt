AITA for suggesting someone to tip better?
I picked up a job as a waiter in a restaurant. 

The other day, two men came in for dine in. Their meal goes smoothly and I box up their leftovers. As I’m dropping off the check, I ask, “How was everything tonight?” One of them says, “The duck was a bit dry.” To which I respond, “I’m sorry to hear that — I’ll let the chef know.” Naturally I would have liked to have given a discount at the very least, but my manager was busy and they were anxious to leave. So, I drop off their check and move on. As I’m cleaning up the table, I see that they both left a $0 tip on a $65 bill. Ouch. 

A week later, I’m at a bakery with my family. As I’m idly waiting for my order, I notice someone behind me shifting uneasily. I suddenly recognize him as the very same customer from the restaurant. Lo and behold, the man he was eating with shows up next to him. 

The cashier hands me my order, and as I turn to leave, I say, “Be sure to tip these folks better than me, alright?”

I walked away from their ashen faces, laughing inwardly. 

When I told my family about this, they said this was a terrible breach of decorum, but I’m not so sure. It is the customer’s prerogative to tip what they want, even if it’s a nominal amount, but no tip at all sends a strong message. 

TLDR: Gently reminded a “tipless wonder” to do better next time.
