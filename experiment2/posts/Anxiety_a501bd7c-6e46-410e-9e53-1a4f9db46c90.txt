Got this email form my chorus teachers todayâ€¦ What do I do? This is what he said:
Hello,
Some of your Concert Choir peers reported to me that you were not a team player during sectionals today. Behaviors such as:

-chatting
-being disrespectful to section leaders
-disregarding the agenda of the rehearsal
-using your phones (which should be stored in the choral cabinet)
-not having or opening your music at all
-poor attitude

This is extremely disappointing, this sort of behavior will affect your participation grade for the week, and if continued will put you at risk for not participating in our Music Trip.
I will be visiting your sectionals on Thursday and expect a BIG improvement.
