Why is animated porn big in Japan, but not in the west?
Something that's been bugging me for a while is that while animated porn, a.k.a. hentai, is quite common in Japan, and even has some big names and budgets behind it, animated porn in the west is a much smaller industry dominated by works based on existing franchises helmed by individuals with much smaller budgets. What's up with that?

What was the chain of events that led to Japan's near-monopoly on the animated porn industry, and why haven't things changed that much since? What do you think it would take for things to change?

Seriously this has been on my mind for a long time and I'd love to know more
