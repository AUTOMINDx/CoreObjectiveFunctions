[NY] Mesh Masks in Mask Mandated company
I didn't know what other flair to use so I put it as US specific. 

The company I work for has mandated that associates wear masks at work. This is fine by me and a lot of people don't seem to care either. 

But yesterday I noticed a team lead wearing a sparkly black mask. I thought maybe I saw her mouth under it but I didn't say anything because maybe the sparkles caused an optical illusion. 

Today I saw another person, who is many years my senior in terms of employment at the company, also wearing a similar mask but in vibrant colors. So I asked her where she got it. 

She told me to search Amazon for a mesh mask. 

Does this technically violate a mask mandate? At any rate, isn't this dangerous? 

Should I mention this to my building's HR person? 

This makes me rather mad, because in my opinion this is a health and safety risk. My mom passed because of Covid, so maybe it's just too personal. 

What should I do?

Edit: These masks are very pretty, and I wouldn't mind a mesh mask if it was intended to be used over a proper mask to decorate it.
