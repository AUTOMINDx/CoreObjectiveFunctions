AITA for insisting my ex contribute to Christmas
My (31F) ex (29M) have two kids together (5M and 3M). We were never married &amp; split amicably when the youngest was one. We’ve remained friends and have a wonderful co-parenting relationship. 

In Feb, my ex started dating a woman (T) with three kids. We’ve all met and she and her kids are very sweet. Recently, however, my ex called to let me know that T was having a hard time financially. I sympathised initially until he asked me to “pick up the slack” with our kids’ Christmas this year so he could help with hers as he can’t afford to buy for five kids. I said absolutely not. These are his kids too and he is expected to contribute. He called me an AH and said I could afford it. I told him that wasn’t the point &amp; that he is responsible for his own kids first. He told me that I was ruining our good co-parenting relationship out of “spite” for him moving on (absolutely false).

I mostly believe I’m in the right. I’d even be willing to buy a few small gifts that my kids could give to T’s. The only reason I’m even entertaining the idea of being the AH is because he is right - I can afford to give my kids a good Christmas on my salary alone. AITA for dying on this hill?

Edit: Thank you all for your opinions. I’ve decided to mostly stick to my guns, but explain why to ex and try to find a solution that works going forward I plan to suggest alternating Christmases. I’m also going to speak to a lawyer about setting up a proper custody agreement. Finally, I’m going to go ahead with getting the little gifts for T’s kids, particularly with the idea that they might one day my kids’ step siblings. Thank you all again. Have wonderful Christmases if you’re celebrating!
