21 years old and not having the slightest idea of what I can do
Hello there,

So I turned 21 last month and still just work in a low hour/week minimal wage supermarket job and my only experience past finishing high school was studying 1 semester of business law, which I hated and stopped doing. It was partly because I wasn't intersted in the subject at all but also due to my bad mental health. I've been into a psychiatric facility for 5 months total from end of last year until March 2021 and since then my mental health slightly improved but it's still in a very bad spot. But that doesn't really matter since nobody give a shit about how you are feeling anyways so I'm trying to figure out at the same time what kind of educatio n I can pursue.   
The problem is that depression and social anxiety didn't really let me explore my interests. I don't know what I'm interested in, I even believe that I'm not interested in anything really. If that is my depression talking or just me being a lazy pos in general I'm actually not sure.  
So I'm kind of desperate to find out what I wanna do with my life, I did some online tests, did practice some math without any real career goal in mind, I wanna start going to the gym soon although that might not be possible because COVID cases are insanely high here in Germany atm. So basically I try to improve my overall well-being so that maybe I will be more motivated to do things in general and might end up being interested in something that I can turn into a job. But if I'm being honest, I'm really scared and kind of desperate about my future, I seem to be the only one I know that is completely directionless in life and it takes a toll on my self-esteem aswell.
