Conflicting advice
Specifically when it comes to degrees. I just noticed this today when I was reading a post about whether it’s worth doing a law degree. In my country (uk) law in undergraduate and costs the same as every other degree. But it is very very oversaturated and it can be very very difficult to get a job in law unless you’re from the top 10ish unis. Even Oxford and Cambridge grads can struggle sometimes. And the non-law prospects are nothing special over any other degree. BUUT you don’t actually need a law degree to be a lawyer here, 50%of lawyers at top firms don’t have one. Anyway that’s not remotely the point of this post.

It hit me when I was reading the comments how absolutely polar the advice we get is. There was 1 guy who said, "absolutely don’t do a law degree I did one and couldn’t find a job for years and I’m only earning 30k now, it’s so oversaturated and a very dry degree with few benefits" another saying that it was very enjoyable and even though he’s not working in law he doesn’t regret the degree because he found it interesting, then people who were working in law but wish they’d done a different degree and advised OP to do something else. And of course people working in law who enjoyed their law degree and are both happy/unhappy with everything.

Like if I was to post saying shall I do languages or computer science onto some subreddits, I’d get 50% of people telling me to do computer science because I won’t get a job in languages and i’ll have a much better career and salary in compsci, then another 50% telling me to do what I love, because it’s not worth being unhappy in your career for the salary.

My question is when advice is so conflicted like this how are you ever meant to make these decisions, it just makes me more confused sometimes.
