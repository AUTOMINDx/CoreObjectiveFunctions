Lack of motivation
Everyday i have no motivation to do anything productive. My grades are trash, i am super incompetent and i don’t really have any motivation to get my life together. Everyone around me seem to have their shit together and seem to be doing well in life. I really want to improve myself but just don’t have the willpower to do it. Every time i try to get my shit together my mind just seems to tell me otherwise.
