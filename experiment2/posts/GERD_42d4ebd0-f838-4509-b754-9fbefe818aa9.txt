Chest/Back Pain &amp; SOB
I’m a 25 year old female, and I’ve always had issues with normal acid reflux, but a few weeks back I started having chest pain and sob. I went to the immediate care thinking that something was wrong with my heart, and after many tests, they came to the conclusion that it’s GERD. I’m on 20 mg omeprazole once a day and taking mylanta as needed, but I’m not seeing any results after weeks. My anxiety gets so bad with it that I’m fully convinced at times that I’m just going to d!e. I have an appointment in February with a GI specialist, but the sob really scares me having to wait this long, because some days it lasts all day long. Is there anything I can do to ease at least the sob symptom? I’m constantly checking my pulse and doing deep breathing exercises to calm down but I’m just really in a funk over all of this.
