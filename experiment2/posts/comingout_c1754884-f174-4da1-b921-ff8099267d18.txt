Bisexual &amp; definitely cant come out to dad.
I'm a bisexual male and the only people who know I am, ar my mother and auntie &amp; all my friends. I just have a problem telling my father. Because he would definitely not be okay with me being like that at all. In his mind he'd think I'm a faggot or something like that. I dont know. I just come out for myself actually. So stuff makes more sense ofcourse.
