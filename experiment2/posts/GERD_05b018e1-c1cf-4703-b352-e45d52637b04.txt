GERD relapse while on meds-- what gives?
So I went through a medical journey this summer after a series of incidents where I couldn't swallow food. Had an endoscopy and was told I had GERD. For two weeks I took Carafate, and ever since my diagnosis, have taken Omeprazole 40 MG twice a day, plus Famotadine twice a day two. Things were going pretty well, I was able to eat a lot of the foods I like, and drink alcohol while keeping things under control. Then, last week, I suddenly woke up coughing, with my throat burning. Boy, ever since then things have been like they were this summer. I have continued the meds this week, and have adjusted my diet ( no drinking coffee or alcohol). I don't know what to do, but the pain is interfering with my work, and it is giving me stress beyond belief. Any suggestions to get through this patch?
