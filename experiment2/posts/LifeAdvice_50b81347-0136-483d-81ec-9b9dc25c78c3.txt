Where do i start working on myself?
I've had developed anxiety in my early years and that has lead me to a point in my life where i havent had the chance to develop any of my talent and hobbies. Fortunately, i am still very young (16,M) and i would say i am quite privileged but neglected by my parents in terms of guidance. I genuinely want to do better in my studies and work on myself. but i have no clue on how to i. e where to start. And i am afraid to do things my way in the fear of it being counter productive or useless. Any advice?
