Today was my birthday
My mom and dad called from out of state and sang me happy birthday. My child called me from my ex's house to say happy birthday, say she didn't want to talk, and hang up on me (she's 5, so it's fine, kids haven't developed the part of the brain that empathizes haha). A handful of people posted on facebook, my coworkers responded to me saying it was my birthday with a halfhearted song.

I really thought by 31 I would have someone special waking me up with a kiss and a "Happy birthday". Maybe making me breakfast, or making plans for taking me out for a special meal. I make up for it to a degree by spoiling myself rotten- I'm fortunate to have an uncommon skill set and a good job. I bought myself a new car 2 days ago, and even though it's mostly because my old one broke down, so many people have made comments about how I've "made it" and that buying myself a gift like that for my birthday is admirable. All I want is for someone to finally cherish me. Fuck the car.
