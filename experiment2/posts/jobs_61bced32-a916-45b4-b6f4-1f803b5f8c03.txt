I hate working from home
Since the pandemic started, everyone is talking about how the work world has changed and WFH is now a real option for a large part of the workforce. I had a job for a few months where I was working from home and I liked some aspects (not having a commute was pretty nice and it was a timesaver to not have to pack my lunch every day) but my work seriously suffered because I got distracted too easily and it was hard for me to consistently communicate with my coworkers over email and chat. 

I see a lot of people who love WFH and want to keep doing it even after everything goes 100% back to normal and I definitely understand why, but I really hope that it doesn’t become the norm because it definitely doesn’t work for me. 

What are people’s opinions?
