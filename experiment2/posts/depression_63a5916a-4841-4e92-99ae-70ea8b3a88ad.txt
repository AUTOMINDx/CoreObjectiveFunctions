dropped 3 people
none of them cared anyways. ample time for them to have even an iota of an interaction happen with me that wasn't initiated by me. 

i was always the one to say something first and hang out or talk. its always me.

shows that they dont really have the interest in our friendship that i do. thats fine i guess
