Anyone notice that their nparents are absolutely AWFUL at gifts?
Idk if it’s just my nMom, but she gifts the WORST gifts. Not just to me but pretty much everyone. Eg, regifting random and useless free gifts or thrift shop items from years ago, or gifting stupid shit that obviously shows that she doesn’t even bother to learn about what gifts people actually want. From my perspective it seems like more of an exercise to make her look good bc she’s giving people gifts, which makes her a “good person”. 

Not to mention she always gets me things that I specifically tell her NOT to buy (bc there’s always strings attached with receiving things from her), then she gets offended when I don’t use what she gives me (“you just hate everything I like”). 

Any similar experiences?
