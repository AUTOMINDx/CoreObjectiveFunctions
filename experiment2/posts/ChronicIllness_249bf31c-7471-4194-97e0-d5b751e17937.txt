mixed feelings about visiting for the holidays
Every year seems to be the same, my husband, daughter and pets have to pack up and travel to visit both sides of the family, who are 3 and 5 hours drive away, over the Christmas period despite us offering to host. A couple of times my parents have accepted an invite to us but only when all of my siblings have had other plans. My in-laws on the other hand have always found excuses not to visit, including claiming illness at the last moment when I've run around getting everything ready, and want us to go there instead. 

I've always put my foot down on allowing my daughter to wake up in her own bed and open gifts on Christmas day but I still seem to spend the little time off I have driving up and down the country, which is exhausting for anyone but when you have several chronic health conditions means I get virtually no rest and end up straight back to work.

How do the rest of you manage the holidays and family demands?
