Secondary Router working but main is not
Usually I’d ask google this but all I’m getting is secondary router not working which is not the issue I’m having.

My main router is sending a signal and I can connect but then nothing happens and it can’t load anything at all, this is not it being really slow. This router has been reset many times in the last 2 days, including leaving it off for a few hours.
My secondary router that is connected to the main by cable works just fine so I’m very confused as to what’s going on.

Any idea what’s going on and how to fix it? Thank you in advance for any help.
