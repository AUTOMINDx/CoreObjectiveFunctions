Entrepreneurship is the goal, what's the path?
I'm a final year Business student.  


My end goal is to one day start my own business, be that a one person shop or a huge conglomerate.

I just don't know where to go following college.

Ultimately I'm fascinated by how businesses make money, how they grow, how they differentiate themselves and how one thrives while another dies.

I'm thinking of doing an add on course in college to learn software development.  
That way I'd be learning an invaluable skill, that not only offers great job prospects but also would allow me to one day work for myself - plenty of room for entrepreneurs in tech.

I'm considering digital marketing (Masters, it's cheap in Ireland)- Marketing has been my best subject, the digital/analytical side of things interests me too.  
But here in Ireland pay is poor and there's a chance I'd just end up running social media accounts which isn't something that particularly interests me.

Sales - Not sure if it's for me, but it could be. I think learning to sell is an invaluable skill.

 Management Consulting - Interested in what makes a business succeed. Management Consulting would allow me to get into that upper level of Business management, potentially joining a company/start up, who knows..  
But I'd need a good masters to get into one of those grad programmes, which is easier said than done.  
Plus I've heard the work is quite unfulfilling - Endless presentations etc.

I don't know where I should go from here, any ideas?
