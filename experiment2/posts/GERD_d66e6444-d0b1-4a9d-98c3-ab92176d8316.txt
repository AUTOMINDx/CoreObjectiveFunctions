Just need relief
My flare up hit about 45 mins ago. Since then I’ve taken Pepcid, pepto, and am sipping water and baking soda (gross).  I’ve vomited a few times and have excess salivation and horrible pain in my chest and throat, and itchy ears. No idea what caused this flare up as I’ve been mostly fine for weeks.  I can’t lie down and can’t fall asleep. I hate this.
