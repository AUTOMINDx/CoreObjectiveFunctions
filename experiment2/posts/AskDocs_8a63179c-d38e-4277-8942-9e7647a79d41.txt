Upper right side pain after drinking alcohol.
I've been meaning to get this checked out for a while but by the time I get around tokt the pain passes. So I'm a 22 year old man. I don't smoke (the odd one when im out but im not a smoker if  that makes sense ) Not a big man for drugs either and I wouldn't be a massively heavy drinker. But recently after a few pints in the pub (6 Guinness  and 2 shots and a can of Carlsberg after that) I woke up the morning  after with a dull pain in my upper right side that is slightly impacting my breathing (hurts when I inhale and  feel as if I'm not getting a full breath in) It has been going on a few days now and I notice I'm peeing a lot more than usual too. All the signs point to something with the liver and it has happened to me before on about 5 other occasions and passed after a few days, albeit after heavier drinking sessions. The pain is in the upper right quadrant of my torso and I can feel it up to my neck and shoulder area and in behind my shoulder blade. My concern is that I have drank more than that on occasions and not experienced the pain. Another side note I was ill that night (not alcohol related mind I got a bad takeaway) but other nights I had gotten sick due to consumption and the pain followed anytime alcohol has made me sick. Does anybody else experience this and should I be concerned? I'm not a heavy drinker (as much as it might seem that I am) but there is an element of familiarity to this issue now which is worrying me considering my age. Could anybody shed light on what it is for me? It would be greatly appreciated. Cheers any comments appreciated
