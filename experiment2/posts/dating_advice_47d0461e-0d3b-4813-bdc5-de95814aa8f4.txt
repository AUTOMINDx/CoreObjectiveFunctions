How do you meet people naturally in this day &amp; age?
I’m 20m &amp; I just recently moved to a new town and don’t know anyone. I’ve done the whole dating app thing, and to be honest I’m really sick of it. I think it’s a very unnatural way to meet people &amp; I don’t believe it’s a true way to find a good connection. But with Covid &amp; everything it’s kind of hard to go out to say, a bar and meet someone. I also really don’t like social media and don’t use Instagram or tiktok and I feel like that instantly puts me at a disconnect with a lot of people my age, particularly girls. I’m really sick of the whole hookup &amp; fwb thing and that’s all I’ve really been able to find through dating apps. I really want to find a real connection, and I know you can’t force that type of thing but dating apps just aren’t it for me.
