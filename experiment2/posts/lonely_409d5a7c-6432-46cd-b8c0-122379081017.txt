There is hope.
Loneliness… loneliness…. Loneliness I thought to myself I would never be free from such a feeling but I was greatly mistaken. I appreciate that random guy that came up to me at the lunch tables as I was sitting alone in high school . He asked nicely and politely if he could be sit here. Without hesitation I said” yes” as sparks flew from my eyes. In present day that same random guy is now my best friend for 7 years and all the countless laughs we have endured throughout all those years I appreciate greatly. For anyone that is reading this and still thinks they won’t escape this endeavor of loneliness, message me and I can be your virtual friend and hopefully change that :)
