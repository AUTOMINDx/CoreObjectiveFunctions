Mystery foot pain keeps coming back!
Hi, first post on reddit and desperately searching for help. For three years my husband has been having a reoccurring pain in his foot that is accompanied by swelling on the top of his foot, redness, bruising, and a complete inability to put weight or even slightly touch said foot.

Its caused him so much pain that he is now crying (I've never seen this man cry literal tears in the almost 8 years we've been married) and we have had to purchase a wheel chair just so he can move around our home.

This condition has been coming on more and more as the years go by. I've taken him to the ER and had Xrays done, I've taken him to a podiatrist who had an MRI done and no one can find the issue. It has been speculated that it could be gout, plantar fasciitis , and soft tissue damage. But no matter who we see all we get is over the counter pain meds and anti inflammatory meds. They cant or wont tell us how to avoid his foot getting hurt again, and we havent been able to get a proactive treatment that targets the root of his problem.

Tomorrow I'm going to schedule an appointment with an internist to see if maybe they can help us. Its swollen so bad this time that his foot looks almost unrecognizable from how it used to be. Please if anyone has seen something like this or knows what the condition is please help us out.

Just to add, he is a relatively healthy 26 year old, no drinking, no smoking, was working out every day until his flare up, and 250lbs. Yes hes a bit big but he was eating really healthy and loosing weight. He's always struggled with weight

He's currently taking 800mg of ibuprofen to help with pain but he says that its not helping much if at all
