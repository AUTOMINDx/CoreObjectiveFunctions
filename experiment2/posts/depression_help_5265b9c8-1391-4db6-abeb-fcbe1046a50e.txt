I went to cheer myself up fail
I'm dealing with grief management on top of depression. (Grandma is slipping away. I only have my dad and grandma) 

So I spent today helping her. It was rough but I got through the day (7 hours!). I decided I'd order some Chinese takeout from the place me and her would go to every Wednesday when I was little (it's my "bad day comfort food" place)

I had to hype myself up enough to make the effort to call and order cus when I'm by myself I don't feel like I'm worth the effort. And I got into the car to pick it up. I'm at the door and it's my old AP Lit/Comp teacher. I haven't seen him since his trip to the UK he brought my classmates and I on. But big issue: that wasn't his wife. We both deer in headlights'd

I'm still pretty shook cus I'm awkward in general but.... I dunno it was like a No Santa moment. His whole thing was about the importance of love and how important his wife and daughters were

I know it's a dumb thing to be hung up on but I didn't have any real experience with normal relationships growing up since I was always alone and in a single parent home. Reality is a bitch
