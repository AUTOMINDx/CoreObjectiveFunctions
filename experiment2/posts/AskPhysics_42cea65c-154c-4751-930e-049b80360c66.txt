From Engineering to Physics
Let me start by saying I am a 40-year-old with a Chemical Eng degree and a masters in data analytics, working in a data field, but I have always been interested in studying physics more formally, since I started doing it as a hobby.

What would be the best route for someone with my background to get into the physics world? A masters? Or must I start with undergraduate?.

I have a lot of the math and basic concepts from my undergrad and grad studies, and I have been getting into the deeper stuff informally for a while now, but I am very attracted towards focusing more time and maybe a career in something that really fulfills me, as theoretical physics does.
