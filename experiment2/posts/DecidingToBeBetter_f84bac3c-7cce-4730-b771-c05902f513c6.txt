Antidepressant-free for 5 days without withdrawal effects!!
Today is 29/11/2021 and I'm free for 5 days (since 24/11/2021).

I sometimes feel like I'm getting angry but I know that it's because of withdrawal and I'm trying to control myself as well.

Somedays there will be times that I take a pill but not everyday. I will also write down those days.

Also I'm gonna take vitamine supplements. Also I'm gonna help myself with therapy. 

I'm curious if my journey will have a good end or not haha lol I hope I will see a good end. =)

Let's focusing on myself more than ever!!

Best,

Ok\_Idea8311.


EDIT: Today (December 7th, 2021) I took a pill. I was see no symptoms of withdrawing btw. It was not necessary but I thought that taking one pill will be ok.
