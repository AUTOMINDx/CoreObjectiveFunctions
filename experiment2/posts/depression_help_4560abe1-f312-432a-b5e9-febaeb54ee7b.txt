My parents don't want me to get therapy because they believe god and church will magically un-depress me.
Just like in the title. I am severely depressed for a couple of years. Everytime I ask them for a therapy or a meet with a psychologist our conversation goes something like this:
-I need to see a psychologist I'm not doing too well at school, everything overwhelmes me
-It's normal for your age, I'm also feeling bad and I don't reach for help to doctors
-But I really need it
-It's Sunday today let's go to church
-Church and god aren't therapists
-They are like therapists
-No they aren't
-Don't say stupid things and go with us
I don't really mind going there, but the ignorance of my parents is starting to destroy my mental health.
I just can't take it any longer and I'm considering suicide. They won't help me unless I go to the school counselor and tell him about my problems. But I bet my parents will say it's nothing. I know that my issue sounds funny but how do I explain them the difference between a real therapy and going to church every Sunday? I'm desperate for help..
