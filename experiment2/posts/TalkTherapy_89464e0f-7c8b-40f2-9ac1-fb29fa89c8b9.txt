Quitting
Have you ever shown up to therapy and out of the blue, told your therapist you are quitting and to take you off their schedule? How did they respond?

Nothing in particular has happened, but I am just descending into hopelessness and trying to talk about my family and past feels like it hurts more than any of this is helping, so I just want to quit. I promised I wouldn’t do that by email or text, that I would talk about it in session, and I can’t break those promises. So I decided to just do it. But then I chickened out, wondering in the instant if T would take me seriously and say okay and bye and I would be done and really be alone. So now I’m confused if I am just seeking attention or something.
