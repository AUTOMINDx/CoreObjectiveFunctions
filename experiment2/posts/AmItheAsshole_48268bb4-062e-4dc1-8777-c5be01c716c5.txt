AITA for Using the Accessible Bathroom?
I was at the mall and needed to use the bathroom asap to change a feminine product. The normal sized stalls were very small and it would have been too crowded for me to use with the two bags I was carrying. I also needed to have a handrail to help get myself back up due to lower back issues.

In less than a minute, someone comes into the bathroom and is cursing saying how "these stalls are way too small, I need the handicap bathroom". She started cursing more saying "there better be someone in a wheelchair in that bathroom. I swear if the person is not handicapped.." (so on and so forth). She had gotten increasingly loud and aggressive to where I was too scared to finish using the restroom so I quickly cleaned up and left to get out of there as fast as I could.

The second I walk out of the door, she is yelling at me and calling me nasty slurs because I didn't have a visible disability. I left without washing my hands to avoid her trying to start a fight and while I was using the hand sanitizer outside of the restroom you could hear her yelling at the top of her lungs that I am nasty b*** and that I was not disabled and had no right to be in that stall.

AITA for using that stall? Or was she in the wrong?
