How did the Ottoman Empire survive its fratricide law?
In 1451 Mehmet II codified a law that bade the Sultans after him to kill their brothers after they ascend to the throne to prevent civil war. This law remained in place until Ahmed I's reign in the early 17th century, over 150 years later. How did the Ottomans not only survive, but expand during this period? Wouldn't the ability of a Sultan to legally murder his brothers only add to the likelihood of a civil war and dynastic infighting, since the brothers would find it in their best interest to preemptively rebel against/usurp the Sultan before he had them executed?
