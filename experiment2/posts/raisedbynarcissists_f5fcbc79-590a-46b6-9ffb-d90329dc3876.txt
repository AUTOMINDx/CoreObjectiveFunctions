I'm afraid being happy will make me poor and desolate
When I was living with my nparents, I could not be myself. I could not show joy or excitement or any emotion for that matter. 

Anything I cared about openly was taken away or held over my head as a threat to be taken away. 

Being happy or excited was mocked and shamed and put down. 

Well now I feel like being happy is a threat to my existence. 

Like if I'm happy and make choices based on what I want, I'm not going to take the job with the abusive boss.

So then I donâ€™t....

But what is mind boggling to be is that THAT'S ALL THERE IS. It's like, either:

a.) I'm happy and joyous and express myself creatively and am fun to be around and exercise and have friends...... but can't keep a job (like something crazy will happen, not like I just quit) and run out of money, or

b.) I am making money and can afford to live, but I'm abused verbally, emotionally, sometimes physically at my job.... and become a shell of a person who has no friends or personality.

And this isn't like... retail jobs. These are generally like, decent-on-paper office jobs in multiple industries.

It's like, the obvious answer is like, Well why can't you make money AND be happy? Why can't you have friends AND not be homeless?!?! Why can't you find a reasonable workplace where you aren't harassed?????

THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING!!!!!! I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!! AGJGhghhhhh

It's like somehow my nparents have trained me that being happy = danger so I subconsciously like, fulfill that prophecy?? I legit don't know what to do. 

It's like I give myself permission to be happy and then SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS.
