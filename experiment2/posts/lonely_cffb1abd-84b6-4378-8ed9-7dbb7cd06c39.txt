When is my time finally coming?
I’m tired of being told that’s things will be better, that I need to learn how to love myself 

I’ve been trying that for the past ten years, I want some goddamn company. I want to be held, loved and finally be enough for someone. 

The scary part is that I really don’t think this dating thing will ever work out. I don’t think I’m ever going to find my significant other and I’m just holding on to false hope that there’s someone out there for me.
