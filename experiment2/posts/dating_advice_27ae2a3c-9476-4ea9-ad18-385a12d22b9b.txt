Just got over break up, what now?
I just got over a break up and it was hard but needed to be done. I feel like I can’t go without someone in my life for weeks. I want to date again. Anyone have advice on how to get back out there? I know it seems bad I’m ready to date again a week after a break up but I can’t do this :(
