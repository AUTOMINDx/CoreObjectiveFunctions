Why is a specific diagnosis so important?
Why do I need to be labeled as having BPD or PTSD or Bipolar Disorder or whatever? Why can't we just work on my specific issues without a label? My issue are paranoia, an explosive temper and a tendency to push people away. I want to work on those things. I don't want a diagnosis because that follows me around. People go around calling me borderline or whatever and it becomes part of my patient file. I don't want that.
