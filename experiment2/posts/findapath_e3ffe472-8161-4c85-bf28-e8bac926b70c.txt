What's are some cool, interesting jobs for people that are smart, physically fit, and want to have an adventure?
Currently an undergraduate math student. Have pretty good analytical skills. Am in decent shape. I have some background in software development and computer science, but don't want to be stuck at a desk 24/7. Want to go on an adventure while I'm still young and healthy.   


I have considered the military, but I don't know much about the type of work they do regarding technology. What are some things I should look for specifically in the military if I wanted to go in that direction?   


What are some other jobs or career fields I should look into? I like math, solving puzzles, technology. I don't mind working on a computer or desk, I just don't want to do it all day, every day. Travelling would also be nice.
