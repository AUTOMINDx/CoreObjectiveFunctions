Girlfriend maybe pregnant, my parents are strict and religious. And there would be a lot of ramifications. What do I do?
I’ve (19M) been dating my girlfriend (19F) for a couple of months been talking exclusively for over a year. 

Recently my girlfriend hasn’t had her period after 37 days. We use protection 99% of the time, the 1% was 4 times for 20 seconds or less near the beginning. My girlfriends been very stressed about it and has taken a pregnancy test which has come back negative. The thing is she could have taken the test too soon (10 days after). She’s been having some panic attacks about it and wants to tell her parents tomorrow. I told her if that’s what makes her feel more comfortable and would put her at ease I understand. My parents are religious and don’t believe in premarital sex, on top of I haven’t made an impression on her parents yet. Making this situation a lot more complicated. If my parents find out I’m fucked, on top of her parents may not let me see her alone and a lot of lost trust in me.I’m writing this to clear my mind as I can’t talk to anyone about it, also I’m not sure how to navigate it going forward(taking some space?). I respect her decisions and what she wants to do, the question more so is what can I do going forward?

Sorry if this is poorly written I typed it up fast.
