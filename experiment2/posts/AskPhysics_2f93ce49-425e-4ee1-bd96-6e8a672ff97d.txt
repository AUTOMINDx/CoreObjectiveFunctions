why the water doesn't keep filling the cup?
imagine you have a bottle of water and then you flip it and start filling a cup or any container, as the water falls and fills the cup it gets to the point where the mouth of the bottle is and the water stops falling. why does this happen and sorry for the stupid question:) i hope explained it properly
