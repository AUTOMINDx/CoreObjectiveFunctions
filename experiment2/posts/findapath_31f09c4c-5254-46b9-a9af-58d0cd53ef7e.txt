Question about raises and how to approach things?
So pre- COVID when I was hired I was told I’d receive a raise annually even if it was small, year one I got a 50 cent raise, year two there was no raise, year three everyone, including new hires were bumped to 14/hr so in other words I was getting paid as much as the guy who started yesterday. This is about to be my fourth year, it’s a part time overnight stocking job, the old manager left and I approached the new manager about a raise, she brought up a bunch of little petty things I wasn’t doing right from the few times she’s seen me (night crew only sees her an hour one day a week), I explained to her everything she had a problem with; dress code, music, etc. where things I had checked with my immediate supervisor and they gave me the ok. She asked me if I thought that was good enough of a reason to deserve a raise. So I bit the bullet, I fixed everything she had an issue with and I was the only one, two months later I ask her if I’m doing better she says yes, another month passes and my supervisor stops me before I leave, he says good news the in order to stay competitive this company is offering all its employees a dollar raise I say thanks. So my question is, should I continue to push for *my* raise or should I leave it be? 

Sorry it’s so long if you can read it all help cuz it gives me a headache but:

TLDR: Pre-COVID raise, everyone including new hires bumped to same pay level with post COVID raise. Asked manager to be bumped up since I’ve been there longer, district manager bumped everyone up a dollar, should I keep pushing and if so how?
