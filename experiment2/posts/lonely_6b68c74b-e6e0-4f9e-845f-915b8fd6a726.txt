Feeling lonely
Just was awake the entire night holding a pillow so I would feel less alone. So I could feel the warmth of holding something and pretend I was holding someone. 
When you are awake in the middle of the night it kinda feels like you’re alone in the world. Well more the feeling of being lonely. Which for me is maybe worse. 

I just wanted to write this down, I don’t expect any responses.
