How do you guys not care about work after work?
Most days i would have to come home after work and still have to think and plan what I have to do tomorrow at work, and if there is a problem I couldn't solve at work, I would go home and spend hours thinking about it.

How do you guys leave work at work and not care about it outside of work?
