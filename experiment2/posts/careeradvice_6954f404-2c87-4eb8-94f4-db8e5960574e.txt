Looking to quit my job for a career redirect, but don't have something lined up. Is this a bad idea?
**My Issue:**

I recently started a new job as an account executive in an advertising agency, but I'm quickly growing to hate it. There has been an insane amount of turnover during my two months at the agency since I've had to work with 5 different project managers and 3 different direct managers. Also, my manager's boss is on paternity leave. This means that during my two months on the account, I am the most seasoned account services person, expected to understand how the account works. The turnovers are happening across all the departments I work in and it's leading to problems when executing day-to-day projects tasks. All the new hires have been put in roles where they have no support from their managers and everyone is clueless on how to run the account. Additionally, the client I work for is a huge pharmaceutical company with large demands and high volume work. I am working well past 5pm and into the night every day.

**My Goal:**

I'm looking to quit my current job as an account executive in an advertising agency to pursue a job in data analytics. Since I don't have previous experience as an analyst, I want to take a course to learn the hard skills necessary, for example: learning SQL, Tableau, Python. I don't have the time to complete the course while I am working this job (I know myself and there are too many distractions/life commitments for me to complete this while working full time).

**Advice needed/Question needing answer:**

Is it a bad idea to quit my current job, complete the data analytics course in about 2-3months, and hope that it opens the door to many data analyst opportunities which wouldn't consider hiring me before? I would dedicate all my efforts to applying for a job after the course. Something that my current job makes difficult as it is pretty demanded.

Or am I at a disadvantage for being unemployed while completing the course? Will this lead to problems looking for a job after I've completed the course?

Here is more info on my experience:
