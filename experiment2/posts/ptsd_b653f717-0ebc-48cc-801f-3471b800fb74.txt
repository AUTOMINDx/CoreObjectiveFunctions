I need advice; my mom took my dog
TW: Neglect, emotional abuse, drug use

Five years ago my mom said she would do me a favor and watch my dog. 

Long story short, she refused to give him back to me. She has mental/emotional health issues that she will not seek treatment for and after the incident with my dog I became estranged from her.

I’m still worried about the conditions my dog lives in and have called the local police station to do an animal welfare check (the local veterinary clinic said they don’t do home checks). Nothing came of it.

I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid of seeing my mom because she can have violent outbursts, particularly while using substances. 

She’s also alienated herself from her friends and family so we have no mutual contacts who want to help.

It’s been five years and I’m still incredibly sad that I trusted her with my dog. He’s a Golden Retriever and I brought him home when he was 8-weeks-old and then one day he disappeared from my life.

Should I practice radical acceptance? I live in another state now and was advised that taking legal action would likely be a worthless effort that wouldn’t result in change.

She still to this day won’t give him back to me. I’m afraid he’s living in squalor and it breaks my heart that he’s around her when she’s having her wild outbursts.

How do I move forward? I want my dog to have the life he deserves- a peaceful one. Not the one I grew-up in.
