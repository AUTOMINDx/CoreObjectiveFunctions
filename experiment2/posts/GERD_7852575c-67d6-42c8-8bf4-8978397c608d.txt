Do I have Gerd?
I will have trouble breathing and feel relieved after burping. Day after drinking alcohol I feel like I’m dying even if it’s only a couple beers. I will feel chest pains sometimes and back pains arm pains. Went to doctor they did a ekg my hearts fine. If I drink soda or an energy drink it will trigger it is this anxiety? Very uncomfortable feeling :(
