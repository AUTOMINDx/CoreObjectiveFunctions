Feminism, gender inequality, and patriarchy - wanting a new me
I find myself not knowing enough on the subject and what's around it (I'm a 32y cis male) and it's time to put myself at work to learn and adapt to a very much needed shift in society.

What is common knowledge and understandings around these subjects? Also material that helps me (a man) understand closer what I've been doing wrong due to a patriarchal society I've lived in.

What materials (podcasts, videos, books..) on the subjects you know of that are good as a starting point?

I heard of *We should all be feminists*, which could maybe be a good starting point? Anything else? Also videos, podcasts..anything really :)

Thanks!
