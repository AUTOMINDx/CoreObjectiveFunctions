How do I get my mind straight with this situation
There was this girl I was talking to a couple days ago with whom things didn't really go anywhere. We were in different places in life so it's all fine. However, there's this close friend of mine who is hanging out with her on a daily basis. Despite me being fine with the fact that we didn't work out and all that, I can't help but feel kinda angry towards the whole thing. How should I handle this siruation so that it stops bothering me?
