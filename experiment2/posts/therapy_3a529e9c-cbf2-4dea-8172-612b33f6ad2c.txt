Why do little things feel life ending?
I’ve (23 m) have been put through a lot of trauma in my life, and have honestly been more depressed and anxious in my everyday life than I ever have. Sometimes I tell small lies to get out of trouble because I don’t want to cause confrontation, and then I get super paranoid about it. Im a very loyal and honest person in my everyday life but when I get embarrassed by something my whole moral shuts down and I start becoming hyper paranoid, and depressed. I scratched someone’s car today and immediately had a panic attack about the damage I did (it was small) and how it was going to affect my bank and my life. Why do I think like this?
