Theorically, a chaotic system could be exploited to measure distances smaller than the plank length an then to create more precise physical formulas. Can you confirm my hypothesis?
You take two ideal double pendulums. You put them in different starting positions. You release them and start a precise chronometer. Once they have been running for a long time, you take a snapshot of their properties (position, velocity, etc.). You enter the properties into the formulae describing the motion of a double pendulum. By doing a lot of calculations, the formulae give you a very precise initial position. If this is very different from the one measured at the beginning of the experiment, your formulae are not precise enough. By doing enough experiments, you find more and more precise formulas.
