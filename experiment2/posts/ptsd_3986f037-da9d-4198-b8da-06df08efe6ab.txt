Dating anxiety
I hate dating with every fiber of my being because it brings up a lot of emotional trauma/microagressions from growing up with cerebral palsy. I'm hypervigilant and can never relax, even if I like the guy and I'm not able to get to see my therapist for a few days. Just wish there was someone I could talk to about it in private because I'm frustrated/anxious/confused. I either push guys away or trust too fast; is this normal?
