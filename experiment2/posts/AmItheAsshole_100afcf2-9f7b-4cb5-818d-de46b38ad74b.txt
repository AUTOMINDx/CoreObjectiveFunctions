AITA for being angry at my cousin for eating snacks?
Honestly I find this situation stupid myself, but maybe I have been a bit of a douche somehow. Also I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting issues 

I buy snacks for when I'm on my period. I get bad cravings. My family never has anything sweet in the house so I buy them with my own money. I keep them in my room because my dad has a tendancy to just eat anything in the kitchen while I'm in school.

Couple days ago, my cousins came around to my house from a couple counties away while I was in school. 

One of them (14 or 15 M) decides to go into *my* room for some reason. I come home to find my snacks raided. 

I'm fucking livid to say the least! They're all fucking gone! And keep in mind, they were in quite a hidden place in my drawers, so he must've been actively rooting around in my room to find them. I was furious.

I come downstairs and ask what happened, and he admits he found a 'little something' in my room and didn't think I'd mind (little something, as in, fucking everything apparently)

I say he's a dickbag for going through my stuff and my aunt tells me off for yelling at him. I ask for money from him to buy more and he refuses. 

AITA for being so angry?? It's justified in my head but my family thinks I was too huffy about it

Edit: grammar
