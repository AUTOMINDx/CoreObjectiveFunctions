PPI Update
I have now come to a stage where I can use a 20mg PPI once every 4 days. I got it down from 40MG every single day. But I am not able to go down any further. Someone help, any advice.

PS : I think the medical community is extremely irresponsible, there was no need to put me on such high dosages initially, now more than fighting acidity I am fighting the relapse that getting off such high doses gives me.
