Does this sound like GERDS?
I am trying to get to a point where I can go see a doctor and be medically examined, but right now, for my own peace of mind, I’d like to see if this sounds like GERDS. 

I am CONSTANTLY bloated, like look 6months pregnant bloat. Also, I am constantly burping. I have had these symptoms for years. I used to get heartburn or chest pains, but haven’t had those symptoms in a year or so. 

I am tired of being skinny and bloated. 

Thanks.
