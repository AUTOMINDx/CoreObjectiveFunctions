Considering a PhD to move abroad and teach?
I am an American who did an academic exchange in the UK and absolutely fell in love with living there. I was studying journalism and had some amazing work experience with local media. Upon graduation I moved back to the UK to earn my master's with the dream of living there. I also have aspirations to become a professor. I have extensively guest lectured in my old college classes and ran workshops for student newspapers, and really enjoy teaching. 

Despite getting more work experience and loving my classes, the pandemic sent me back to the U.S. mere months into the program. I never felt like I got a real shot at networking.

I graduated with my master's by completing it online from home and have been working full-time as a reporter. All I think about is going back to the UK. I found a PhD program where I could work on a topic I am very passionate about. I would also have the opportunity to lecture and my goal would be to find work or use the PhD to teach at a UK university.

Is this a realistic goal? Has anyone earned their PhD abroad in a field that technically does not require postgraduate education and have been able to get sponsorship, especially in the UK? I am just as passionate about teaching as I am writing and would be happy with either job. I am just not sure if this is a realistic dream. I have corresponded with several faculty members in the department who all liked my research idea and encouraged me to apply. I am worried about devoting years of my life and then not being able to find sponsorship.

Thank you for any insight.
