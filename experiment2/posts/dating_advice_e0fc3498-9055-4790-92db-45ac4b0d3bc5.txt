He’s an amazing guy but I’m just not attracted to him. Should I give him a chance?
EDIT: I should also add one thing. This dude is actively suicidal and depressed (only reason I know this is bc I found his Reddit account and all of his posts were on r/suicidewatch and nothing but posts about him wanting to kill himself). We’ve already been on a few dates and now I feel like if I end things with him that may push him over the edge. And I would never forgive myself for that.

Met this really great guy in one of my classes. He’s cool af, funny, and we get along great. I really enjoy talking to him and he is so damn sweet and treats me way better than any other guy has.

I’m so used to guys treating me like shit or just being weird/creepy and this dude is the exact opposite of all of that.

The only problem is I’m just not attracted to him :( I’m someone who has a very high sex drive and loves to get physical with guys right away but the thought of doing anything physical with this guy honestly turns me off and I can’t see myself even kissing him.

But it really sucks bc he’s such a cool dude! Should I just give him a chance and see if anything changes or should I cut it off right away?
