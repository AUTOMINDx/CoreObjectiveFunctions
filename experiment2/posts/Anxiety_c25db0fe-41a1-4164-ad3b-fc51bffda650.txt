Crazy Anxiety
I am a very anxious and depressed person but I realized recently that I am even more anxious then even I realized. I am constantly in a state of fight or flight. I am special education teacher that works with kids that have emotional issues and my anxiety about how I am doing is absolutely out of control.   I always feel like I am failing. Besides my anxiety about how I am doing, I have social anxiety that is very challenging. It's a mess. Oddly I have been teaching for 20 years so it's hard for me to get out. And I am not sure I should because I really don't have any marketable skills. Any thoughts would be helpful...
