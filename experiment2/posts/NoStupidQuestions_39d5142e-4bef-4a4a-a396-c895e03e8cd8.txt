How many cars are you buying this holiday season and how big a red bow are putting on them?
I, hopefully, succeeded in framing it as a stupid question. However, I have always been intrigued by the car ads during the holiday season. They seem to try especially hard to turn this time of the year into a car buying season. I for one have never thought of buying a car this time of the year, let alone as a gift. So how about you? Do you buy cars as gifts or do you know people that do?
