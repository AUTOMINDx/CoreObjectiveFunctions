I was recently diagnosed with complicated grief disorder. My therapist said she can help me heal, anyone has experience with this ? Is there really a cure ?
Basically my mom died when I was 11 and I’m 24 now and still haven’t accepted it, I can’t even talk about her without feeling like I’m 11 again and feeling the same pain. I’ve been living like this for 13 years, I thought it was normal to feel like this after the death of a parent. I haven’t read anything about a cure to this but my therapist said I don’t have to live in pain and she can help me.
