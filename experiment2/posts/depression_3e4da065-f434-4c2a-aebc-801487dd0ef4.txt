If you've rationalized suicide what stopped you from going through with it.
Realistically my loved ones would move on, I don't have kids or debt, I'm not very spiritual and am pretty agnostic, Im not religious or worried about going to hell for committing, realistically there's no afterlife and I wouldn't feel guilt, I'm feel really unattached towards humans, my dog would be perfectly happy with relatives that he's always excited to see, I feel the same on and off SSRIs, I don't really understand why I wouldn't just stop weathering the storm of my down episodes entirely. People will be sad isn't holding the same weight as it used to.
