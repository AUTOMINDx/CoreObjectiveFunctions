And "so will you meet your mother meet HER GRANDCHILD" and "but she's their grandmother, they have a right to know her" blah blah blah.

Well, they'll go in my FU binder and will be ignored because she will not be allowed anywhere near my child. 

NB: She won't turn up on my doorstep, thankfully.  She's the kind of Narc who must be begged to come back, who must be KNOWN to be the victim being tortured by her horrible child (this is how she ruined Every. Single. Holiday/Vacation. For my entire childhood.
