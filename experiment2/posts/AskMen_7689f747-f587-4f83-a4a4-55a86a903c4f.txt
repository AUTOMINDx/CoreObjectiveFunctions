Would you ever be/ have you ever been in a serious relationship with someone who is physical not your "type"? If you would/ wouldn't/ haven't, why? If you have, what did you learn from it?
E.g. You're into people with brown hair but you suddenly meet someone whose hair is black and that's not really the "type" for you. Same application, but for things like height, structure, specific physical attributes etc.
