[Warhammer 40k] How would Orks respond to a Haka war dance?
Like if they encountered a regiment descendant of Samoans (If you want to just call them Catachans that's fine) and they opened up an engagement with a war-dance. Would the Orks care? Would they respond in their own way and have the first Intergalactic Step-Up competition before slaughtering each other?
