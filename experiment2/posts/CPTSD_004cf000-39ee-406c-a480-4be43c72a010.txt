Good news. I think I finally found redemption. Feels like I’m at the final stage of processing my past. I feel another kind of freedom now. Like, I can finally go and live my life like I want as far as I can in lockdown. It feels like I’ve been released from the chains of my past and start life now.
I now understand why I had anger attacks and so many rages/dysregulation the past 17 months. It was a combination of withdrawal symptoms from Zoloft, processing my diagnosis of MS, the pandemic and discovering that my father was the main reason why I now have Complex PTSD.
It was like a box of emotions that opened that had never been opened before.
This all happened in the same period.
I just was so angry at the world and hurt and what happened to me felt so unfair..
That I felt justified to go on rages at home and break lots of stuff.
But those anger attacks and rages have now disappeared.
With only attachment issues left to solve, I feel I’m finally at rest now and able to focus on the future now.
I feel motivated to start education again.
All this because I took the time to process it all and also because of lots of therapy.
A new chapter is coming I can feel it.
