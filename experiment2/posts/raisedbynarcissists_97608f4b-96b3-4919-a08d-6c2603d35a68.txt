My nparents taught me emotions were unacceptable -- so I never do anything unless I feel 100% perfect
How often do you actually feel totally amazing and content and perfect? Once a week, if you're lucky, right? 

It literally just occurred to me that I've been rejecting opportunity and choosing to be alone and bored doing nothing because unless I feel 100% perfect, I'm going to be abused. 

I just had a flash back to this guy I was in love with, but my job made me miserable, and even though I was happy being around him, I couldn't hang out with him because I thought I needed to be perfect first.

And it's so confusing because people say you have to get your own life together before you have a relationship etc etc, but these platitudes seem to just mess me up. 

You don't have to feel 100% excited and happy for it to be something you WANT.

But if I had any emotional state in front of my nparents, I was an "ungrateful brat," even if I was sick or just tired or just hungry or anything. 

I'm hoping writing it out here will help me remember. IT'S OK to want something and some people will accept you even if you don't feel totally perfect or confident or happy or whatever.
