Can't hit send!
I'm currently doing my therapy virtually, but I've been debating on whether or not I want to switch to in-person even though the thought of that scares me to death. I love virtual, there's just some things I'm hesitant to bring up because I don't want to be overheard.

So I typed up an email to my therapist to ask about discussing this possibility, but I can't bring myself to hit send. First, I'm nervous about how she'll react, maybe she doesn't want to do in-person as I'm her last appointment of the day at 6:00 pm and she might prefer virtual. I'm also just plain scared of going in person because I'll be a nervous wreck by actually being in the same room as her since I know she'll be able to watch my body language even more. 

The email is currently in my drafts folder until I can work up the nerve to hit that send button.
