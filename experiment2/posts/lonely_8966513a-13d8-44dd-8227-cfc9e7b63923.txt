I wasn’t invited…
So today I had diner with my best friend. We hang around in the same social circles and we know the same people and over diner he told me that he was invited to attend a Christmas diner party with a lot of people we both know and like and that I was not invited.
Since we both don’t have a friend group that we are a part of, and the decision to invite me is not up to him, I am of course not mad at him…
But since the whole group of people know me and spend time with me, I felt left out since they invited my best friend and not me…
