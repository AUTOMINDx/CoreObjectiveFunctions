Feeling lost after college and not sure what to do. Any good career advice?
I'll be graduating this summer (fingers crossed).

My degree is just general Business but I've chosen Marketing electives, with a sprinkle of Management and some HR in there too.

I haven't enjoyed college at all, planned on dropping out nonstop.  
I had it in my head that I'd pursue a masters in Management, with aims of getting into Management Consulting - I'm fascinated with how Businesses run and operate.  


I've realised this all stems from my childhood dream of wanting to start my own Business.  
I've a fair idea of the heartbreak, stress and long hours that this will involve but I still want to go my own way.

So beyond knowing I want to (eventually) start a Business, I've no idea what to do..

Here are some ideas -

* Digital Marketing Masters - They're cheap over here, great industry placement. It's something I'd be good at and it looks interesting, from afar at least..
* Conversion 1 year add on into Software Development - Seems like a great skill, problem solving, great jobs etc. I'm just not entirely sure it's for me, if it is it'd be a great option.
* Sales - Great skill to have, commission based again not sure if it's for me.. I do know I'm a big car guy though.
* Something hands on, maybe learning a trade, something I can get stuck into and eventually work for myself in.

The people I respect the most/aspire to be like (other than my father) are guys who've started their own businesses.  
I just know I eventually want to work for myself, I just have no idea how to get there.
