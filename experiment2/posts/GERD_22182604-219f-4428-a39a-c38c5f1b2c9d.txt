Your weight loss from GERD or LPR: are you happy, or worried?
How well have you been following your acid watchers food plan, and how has that affected your weight so far?

I am overweight for my height, and losing weight is one of the recommendations to minimize symptoms of GERD and LPR.

So I'm happy that reduced food quantities and better quality of acid watcher foods has helped me to lose weight.  Until now I've been giving credit to my medications for helping me feel better, but I'm wondering if the weight loss is helping too.

Back in the days when I dieted only to look better in clothes, that wasn't enough positive incentive to avoid treats and cheats, and many times I never reached my weight loss goal.

But eating correctly to avoid GERD and LPR pain is totally different for me.  Recalling the pain from a previous treat or cheat is an effective negative incentive to not make that same mistake again. 

Have you already figured out your trigger foods and your safe foods?  Do you follow your diet pretty well?  Have you lost weight in a good way, or have you dropped into an underweight category?
