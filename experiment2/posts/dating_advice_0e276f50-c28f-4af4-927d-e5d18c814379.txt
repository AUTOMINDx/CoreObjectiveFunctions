Girl I’m dating told me she loves me?
We’ve been on 3 dates so far and have known each other for about a month and a half. Reason why we haven’t been on so many dates is that our schedules at work haven’t really aligned recently. 

Anyway, she invited me over to hers for dinner last night. We went to bed and stayed up until 4am talking amongst other more physical things. 

At one point I made her laugh and I distinctively heard her say “I love you”. I kind of pretend I didn’t hear it. 

Now, don’t get more wrong, I really, really like her. She’s incredible. She cooks me meals, she’s really affectionate, she made me breakfast this morning, she’s funny, attentive and kind.  

I just don’t think I’m at that stage yet. 

What do I do?
