Chronic mental health issues. I genuinely feel more like a vegetable than a person.
I feel like my mind is blank. It doesn't think. I don't have interests. I didn't build myself as an interesting person.

In many ways my treatment is helping me come out of the depression (ok it is failing now again maybe) but no one tells you how to start a life after lifelong mental health struggles.

I feel like people in daily life measure the worth of a human being by their IQ. I don't mind having a low IQ personally, but I feel like others look down on this and use it as an insult :(

I don't know how to speak to others. I am what is called a "dull" person. I spend my days sleeping and what other people would call "wasting time".

It is very hard to feel like it is ok being me. I know this might sound like a ridiculous question, but why do people only like "interesting" people?

Why can't it be ok to be like a vegetable?
