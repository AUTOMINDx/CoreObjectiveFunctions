How do I start conversations with people?
I've had an issue with starting conversations for most of my life as far as I can tell. I use to be amazing at it apparently when I was a kid, atleast that's what my family has said about me. It's to the point where I can't even talk to friends or family first, if noone ever initiated a conversation with me, I likely would not talk to anyone at all. It's horrible for others as well, because I have had multiple people ask me if they have made me upset with them, as I never talk to them first, including my own parents. The issue is that I just feel uncomfortable starting first, and that I feel like I am bothering people if I try to talk to them. I legitimately don't even know what I would talk about, and even if I did I feel like anything I say would be completely pointless drivel. I'm generally pretty good at carrying conversations, and talking to strangers, it just has to be that they talk to me first. I feel like this is hurting a lot of my chances in life, and that it's such an easy fix, that I just can't find the courage to change.
