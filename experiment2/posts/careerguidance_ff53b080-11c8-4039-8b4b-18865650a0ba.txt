I want to switch to a software development career. What is in demand? What are the prospects for someone who is self-taught w/o a CS degree?
I'm looking into a career switch to software development. I currently work in IT and have Windows and Linux administration experience, and like being involved in all areas of a project, so full stack is very attractive to me.

I have prior experience with c# .NET, so .NET core/ASP.NET seem like obvious choices. Are these in demand? What's the best way to go about learning them in ways that will translate well to employment?

Alternatively, there is JavaScript (and nodeJS, reactJS, etc). which seems to be ubiquitously popular, but which I have no experience, unlike c#. 

My degree is in something completely irrelevant to this field and going back to school is out of the question, so a path that is friendly to self-taught, ambitious folks would be best. 

What do?
