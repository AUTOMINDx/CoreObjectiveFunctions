Are my downstairs neighbors in a cult?
I (F28) live in a multi-family house with 4 units. My boyfriend and I have been here for over a year and have seen a few people come and go. We recently got new downstairs neighbors that I haven’t met yet, but my boyfriend says he’s met them in passing. They seem totally normal, except for the extended chanting sessions and frequent noise from what sounds like audio or video of religious sessions of some kind. We are a little freaked out, but mainly curious about the chanting that happens. It sounds like weird singing, except it’s the same line over and over again for at least an hour. From what we can hear, they’re saying “What did you do, what did you do…” and there’s a second line of song that we can’t quite make out listening through the floor. It’s melodic and a little spooky. Obviously, we have no worries about them and they seem completely harmless. I guess we’re mainly curious - does anyone know what religion this might be? The only reason why I think it’s a religion and not just them practicing singing is because sometimes they invite a few more people over and they all chant it in unison. Anyway, looking for anyone who might know what this is or what the next line of the chant might be. My boyfriend is so inspired, he wants to write a story about it.
