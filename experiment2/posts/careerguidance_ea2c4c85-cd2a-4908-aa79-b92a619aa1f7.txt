Will I get fired if I change my approach to work?
E.G i work in insurance claims (bodily injury in Florida) with an overwhelming workload. I feel the need to finish everything each day which isn’t possible without working a TON.

I don’t mind strategically working a few hours extra per week, but I just don’t want to feel the anxiety anymore. Or the fear of being behind. Or I’m on the phone with some and I’m impatient because  I have a ton more to do.

Is adjusting my attitude to calmly prioritize  and do things at a reasonable pace and work reasonable hours gonna get me fired? 


The benefits as I see them
- the important stuff gets done
- my work quality goes up
- my stress goes down 
- I won’t rush and make mistakes as much



The negatives
- I get behind more and more each day
- at some point, my file quality will go down because I’m not touching each file every thirty days (with 200 claims hard to do)
- I may get fired if my coworkers work a lot more hours after hours and I’m the only one who isn’t. Salary position BTW


What do you guys think?
