What part of “destructive childhood experiences” from growing up with alcoholism does a child play?
In today’s HOPE FOR TODAY reading:
“In Al-Anon I learned about alcoholism as a family disease and the role I played. My destructive childhood experiences were not due solely to my parents’ alcoholism. I played a part in it, too, and I lugged my childhood grudges into adulthood. “

HOPE FOR TODAY, page 333.

I can see that a child might play a part, similar to the way in a play, there are minor characters who don’t do anything but appear and don’t affect the action. Such as, servants, etc.
Someone else is in control of the action. 

I guess what I have an issue with, big time, is it seems like to me this is placing some of the blame on the child. 
I guess because for so many decades, when I tried to talk about my experience as an child of an alcoholic,
I was never heard. The implication to me was that my parents were fucking perfect and I was just an ungrateful little shit.

I get that as an adult child, the “childhood grudges” are something I need to work on.

I guess the way it was said came across to me as I was being blamed, which I was very much used to happening.

Your thoughts?
