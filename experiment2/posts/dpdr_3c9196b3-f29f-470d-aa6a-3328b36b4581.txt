Dissociated at work -BIG TIME
I recently started working at a hospital. Today I had a very challenging day and I started dissociating and it stressed the fuck out of me when I did blood work because I started feeling as if I’m not here and I couldn’t even make sense of what I was doing and it’s frustrating because it is actual blood and if I mess up I’ll have to do everything again and it will make the procedure with the patients and with the staff more difficult.

I am very good at my job and they love how I quickly follow up with them and eith the information but today it was different for me I felt zoned out because of how challenging it was for all of the staff and it freaked me out. 

Idk why I’m writing this but has anyone ever been in this situation? Especially in the medical field?
