Questions for the deterministic world view.
Would you say Heisenberg Uncertainty Principal debunks determinism or gets close to doing it? If not why.

Also doesn't "everything has a cause" result in a infinite regress? Which AFAIK comes with a lot of problems and is heavily criticized. So how do you get around that objection?


Also as thermodynamics states, energy can't be created. So what caused energy according to the deterministic worldview?
