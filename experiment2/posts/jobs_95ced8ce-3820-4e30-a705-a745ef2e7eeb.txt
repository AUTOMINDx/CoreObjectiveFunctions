Recruiters reaching out after starting a new job
I started a new job last month, but now I’m being contacted by recruiters for jobs I applied to and/or interviewed for months ago. I’m a bit curious about some of these positions, so I’m debating if I should be open about having started a new job and use that as leverage, talk to them without telling them I just started a new job, or forget about leaving a new job.
