feeling VERY stuck. i'm tired of ruminating on my future and being indecisive with what to study (zoology???)
So, I've wanted to study zoology since I was in high school. Biology and zoology and math are the biggest things I'm interested in. but I've had my mind set on zoology specifically since I was 18 and I'm 31 now. I got my associate's in biology and then stopped because I live in Arizona and ASU was the closest thing to me and I was dead-set on majoring in Zoology which they didn't have. The closest thing they have is BSc. in Biology, BSc. in Biological Sciences, and a BSc. in Conservation Biology. In my early 20s I didn't know that those degrees pretty much were the same thing as a Zoology degree and I was dead-set on my degree saying "Zoology" because that's what I thought I needed.

Anyway, fast-forward to lame jobs just trying to save up money and no mental stamina to finish school and having no idea what to study and when I'd have time and it's 2019/2020 and I've contacted many people, did a lot of research into the major and what jobs I could get, networked with people across various social media platforms and.. I am crushed.

Time and time again I hear that Zoology majors can't find work. They have to chase jobs all over the country to find something permanent. It's incredibly competitive. Most of the jobs are extremely low paying and stressful and back-breaking. I realized it wasn't as hands-on with animals as I thought. I realized that maybe this wasn't the major I should be pursuing. If tuition was a lot cheaper or free I'd do it in a heartbeat. But I hear time and time again that good-paying jobs are hard to find right out of undergrad and it could take 5-10 years or more to find something that pays decent and is permanent. I've also heard that it's a waste of time stopping at a BSc. Zoology because it's a building-block degree for medical field stuff. Which isn't what I wanted to do. I want to work with animals specifically and I don't want to be a veterinarian either. Veterinary technicians don't get paid well either for the stress that they are under on a daily basis.

My brain is so dead-set on studying Zoology because I don't know any other way I can study it besides paying $40k a year for it at a university. I don't want to miss out on an opportunity to learn amazing things but I want a degree with a good Return On Investment. At this point, even if I can't work hands-on with animals (I could always volunteer to get my animal fix), I just want to know I can find something decent paying if I stopped at a bachelors and didn't get a masters.

I want to follow my heart and just study and learn what I want to.. but I don't want to be crippled with debt. I wish someone could tell me what to do.

For example I googled jobs in zoology:

**Associates Degree Level:**

\-assistant wildlife technician: these positions don't exist, i've been searching for them for years and the pay is low

\-vet technician: pay is low

\-biological aide: jobs don't exist, been looking for years; pay is low

\-biological field technician: requires a bachelors

**Bachelors Degree Level**

\-vet nurse: same thing as a vet tech, don't need a bachelors, pay is low

\-zookeeper: pay is low

\-animal nutritionist: career doesn't exist, it's blended with a veterinarian career, and if it did exist they would certainly require mastery in animal nutrition specifically but veterinarians know all about nutrition and are often consulted for that

\-scientific technical writer: never see jobs for these, seems like it's too difficult to get

\-marine scientist aka marine biologist: most often requires a masters degree

\-environmental manager: yes, requires just a bachelors

\-wildlife biologist: need a a masters to be competitive

**Doctoral Level Degree**

\-professor: too much education for me

\-biologist/zoologist: too much education for me, not enough pay

\-veterinarian: too much education for me, not enough pay
