Wasted youth and life
I spent so many years failing to be a man.  I allowed myself to be stepped on, pressured to do things I didn't want to,  and wither away. I wish I didn't listen to my family.  I wish I didn't let myself be disrespected by peers. I wish I made choices for myself instead of avoiding confrontation from my family or society. I wish I lived for myself instead of others. 

The formative years of my life are gone. I will never have them back.  I should have been educated in many areas of life but I haven't.  I'm no better than I wasat 18. My maturity and intellect is low,  so is my life experience.  I wasted the years I had to become someone I could accept. 

Instead I'm a loser with nothing going for him.  I see no point in looking forward because I've already strayed too far off any path worth traveling
