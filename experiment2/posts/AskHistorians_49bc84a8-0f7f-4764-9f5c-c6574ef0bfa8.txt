Should we even bother reading pop history books if they are riddled with inaccuracies and hasty conclusions?
After some time browsing this sub, I've often come across the realization that many a pop-history book I had read and enjoyed in the past was actually sloppy and questionable. I've had this happen with Guns, germs and steel (apparently common enough that it's become a meme in and of itself for historians), that book about how Nazis used drugs a lot, Mao the Unknown story, and a couple of other titles that I've forgotten over the years.

Should we even bother with pop-history at this point? Is it the equivalent of browsing /r/history i.e. entertaining bro-level half-truths that shouldn't be taken seriously?
