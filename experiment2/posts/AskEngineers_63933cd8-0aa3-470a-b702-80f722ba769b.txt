Stuck in Compliance.. Advice Needed
Burner account to protect my identity. 

Hey, thanks for clicking on this. If you can help me out with some advice I’d greatly appreciate it. 

I graduated in 2020 with a BSME in the Twin Cities, MN. I was a great community member thought undergrad, I founded successful engineering clubs/teams, I was elected to the executive board, and then as president of our local professional organization chapter among other things. Not saying this to gloat, but just to show I’m not some new grad hiding in a corner.. lol.

The problem: When I was in undergrad I was never able to intern. I was a kid coming from poverty putting myself through school, I took community college classes in summers and worked weekends so I could afford my degree. I’ve always wanted to get into aerospace/mechanical engineering work, so while I was a senior I applied to 200+ jobs, got 3 interviews out of it. 2 at local manufacturing companies, and 1 at a large NRTL Testing Lab. I ended up with only an offer from the NRTL so I accepted it to keep the lights on. 

I’ve hated the job from about day 5, and have been applying for jobs weekly since then. I’ve started a Masters at my school to hopefully become more competitive. 


My question: after no hits on ~400 entry level mechanical/aerospace engineering jobs, and tooling up the resume on r/EngineeringResumes, should I explore taking an internship to get into the field I want?

TLDR: I am in a compliance engineer role and want to move to aerospace/mechanical. Should I take an internship to get there?
