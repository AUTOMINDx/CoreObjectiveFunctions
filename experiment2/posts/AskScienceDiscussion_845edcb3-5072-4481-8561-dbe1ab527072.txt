Can we replace the missing whale poop in the Indian Ocean with farmed pig poop to repair the iron cycle there?
We already know that devastating the whale populations of the various oceans was harmful to the ecosystem, but one of the ways that it was harmful was that it removed a prime engine for redistributing iron from the river deltas into the deep ocean where it can feed microbiology at the bottom of the food chain.  These microbial life forms uptake an awful lot of CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, and they are fed upon by krill, which is fed upon by whales.  And when whales die, they tend to head straight to the bottom of the ocean and trap literal tons of carbon on the ocean floor.  

The whales are slowly recovering, but they're doing better in places where the iron cycle doesn't depend on large numbers of whales (e.g. the Atlantic ocean which gets iron from winds over the Sahara).  

We also know that commercial pig farms produce massive amounts of waste.  In some places in the USA it is literally just collected in outdoor pools where it is essentially toxic waste.

So my question is: is this  a win/win situation?  Can we pipe the waste into a ship, and slowly release it into the wake of the ship as it traverses the Pacific/Indian ocean thereby helping restore the food webs of that area and allowing the whales to more easily recover and restore their role?
