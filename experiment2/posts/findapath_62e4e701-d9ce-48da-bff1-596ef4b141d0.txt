Need a way out of cooking.
Hey, I’m 34 year old M and have been cooking in professional kitchens for over 15 years. I am an expat living in Stockholm Sweden since 4 years. Been feeling burned out mainly due to the low wages, long hours and exhausting work culture among other things.  

Currently I have no degree and finding it difficult where I see myself in a new line of work. I feel I have never been a top tier chef by any means and this was just a job I fell into when I was younger and never found a means to get out. I have no interest in staying within the cooking industry in any form.

I have always been interested in finding a career in Tech but I don’t know where or how to start.

Is it too late for someone my age to change career paths? What steps can I take to make a move out of my current job?

I appreciate any helpful advice!
