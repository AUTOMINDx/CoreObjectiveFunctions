Ran into a toxic ex-friend. My partner got me out quick.
I had a big scare the other day. I ran into a toxic ex friend who emotionally traumatized me for over a year before I cut them out of my life in 2020.

I was at a store with my partner, as we exited an aisle we ran into my ex-friend’s boyfriend. I RAN. (If their boyfriend is there, then they must be right behind them.) I think I ran 4-5 aisles away and stopped in an aisle not sure where to go, thinking I should hide in the holiday garlands I was next to because I was nowhere near the front of the store to run outside or in a bathroom to hide, or do I run farther to get out of the store? I was in the back of the store. I was in a full blown panic and scared. I felt my partner take my hand and lead me away quietly whispering “She’s in this same aisle.” (She didn’t see me thankfully) He took me to the other side of the back of the store, set our basket down and said “Let’s go to the mall instead.” I was breathing heavily borderline hyperventilating and I felt embarrassed of how scared and panicked I was, but we left quickly &amp; went to the mall and had a much better day.

I can at least laugh about it now because I realize I had left my partner behind when I ran away…

Please tell your partner or family/friend(s) what to do to help you get away in case y’all run into someone/something that really triggers you or something. When you’re in a panic you may be in a frenzy not sure what to do, and your family/friends or partner can help lead you to safety.
