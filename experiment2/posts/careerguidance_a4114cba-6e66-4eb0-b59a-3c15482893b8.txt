Need advice: What are some tips you have to build meaningful professional relationships?
Hi everyone! long-time lurker, first-time poster here.

Currently located in BC, Canada. I'm looking for advice about relationship building and networking in your own respective industries. For some context, I've been at my job for about 4 months now (co-op turned full-time gig) while being in school (full-time as well, one term away from graduating with an engineering degree). It's a small consulting firm that I work at with maybe only 3 other full-time people, but are very well connected and well-known in the industry. Sometimes I feel a little useless when we're in meetings and we distribute tasks where they plan to leverage their connections to answer questions for a project or get them involved in our own initiatives. I really don't have much to contribute in this regard since I'm still in school and my network is made up of students and instructors that have zero relation to the industry that I work in.

My question is, how do I start building my network? Right now I suck at reaching out to people via Linkedin and being on top of my e-mails/LI messages just to chat, or generally just saying hello to people I meet via work. I don't really have time for it since I'm full-time work and school. Is this something that I should be worried about at this stage of my career? How do I make it less yucky to cold messaging people and make an actual connection? I hate the feeling of making connections for personal career gains.. but I guess that's the name of the game these days. Any advice would be very much appreciated!

TL;DR: About to graduate - need advice for building my network and building professional relationships.
