What should I do next time I see them?
So I went up to the guy I’m interested and spoke to him a little longer this time. I asked about him, he asked me some things. However, there were some awkward silences, he didn’t always look me in the eye, and a few times I couldn’t hear since he spoke low. Should I speak to them again or is something strange going on? Or am I overthinking? Advice?
