Why am I suddenly extremely anxious after the stressful things have been resolved?
I've had a pretty rough past few days. A lady I look after at work nearly died, with me as the only staff member on shift who was responsible for her (not my fault, she has health issues), I've had an assignment for university looming over me for months that I had to start this evening after I've had a grand total of 2.5 hours sleep the night before. I dealt with the lady I look after, got home, wrote 4,000 words, and then had a nap. I woke up and was expecting to feel extremely relieved that the main causes of my stress had resolved themselves, however I ended up having a panic attack instead. 

I guess I'm just confused why this happened when everything was fine and not in the midst of all the chaos?
