I no Longer Commit Small Physical Acts of Self Harm
Made a post asking for help about scratching/biting/rubbing/picking a while ago, and I'm proud to say i haven't really done that in a while. Sure, i have a wee bit of trouble keeping more comfortable postures that I know will hurt me less over time, or centering my tongue in my mouth and stuff.... but despite the anger and frustration and angst I still feel, i no longer hurt myself. It's no longer my primary expression of unwanted emotion. I do not use it to soothe!

I dont wake up with scratches anymore. I don't pinch myself and bite my cheeks raw. I don't obsess over my skin. 

It's nice! It's progress. It's something. And may i continue!
