67M Just got pneumonia for third time
How much time do I have left with my dad?

Height/weight: 220lbs / 5’7

He just go pneumonia for the 3rd time in the past 2.5 years. He was hospitalized once for it during covid (he’s vaccinated). He also takes prescribed hydrocodone (or some opiate version of it) throughout the day bc he has chronic pain from breaking his back and shoulder in motorcycle accidents.

Other health problems:
He’s very overweight 220lbs as 5’7. He has type 2 diabetes and I think emphysema. He smoked for 20 years and was a bit of an alcoholic but quit cold turkey at 35. He was also born with a hole in his heart, but hasn’t had complications from that. He’s said he gets bronchitis every year for several months.
