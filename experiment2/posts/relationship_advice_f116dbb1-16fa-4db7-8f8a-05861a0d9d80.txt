My (21F) boyfriend (25M) of two years has recently started wiping his bogies in me and I really don’t like it
I’m really struggling to get my boyfriend to understand I don’t like it when he tries to wipe his bogies on me. 

He definitely thinks it’s a joke and when he does it, as well as screaming / running away and telling him in a serious tone to not do it, he still does it. I think he thinks it’s funny but it’s not. 

Sometimes I just freeze and close my eyes tightly, laugh / cry with fear that it’ll touch me. Sometimes he gets so close and just hovers his bogie right next to me for a minute or so and sometimes he will actually wipe it on me. He’s twice my size and weighs twice as much as me so I can’t really push him off or get away either and it so frustrating really grosses me out!! 

I’m not a huge germaphobe and we fart on/around each other and do other things like this, but he doesn’t seem to understand I really don’t like bogies. 

Any tips on how to address this with him properly so that he actually stops ? 

P.S I have tried to sit down with him seriously and tell him but he just laughs about it.
