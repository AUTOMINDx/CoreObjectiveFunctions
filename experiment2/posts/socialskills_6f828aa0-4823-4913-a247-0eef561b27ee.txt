How you do deal with the resentment that comes from having to "perform" socially?
I think a lot of the angst I have towards socializing comes from having to do something I don't want to do for the benefit of people I don't care about to get something I don't even want _that_ much.

Like look at me, remembering all the very specific but unspoken steps to this dance that I don't really get or like doing and if I do any part of it wrong you're going to find me very weird, or even be mad at me! I'm definitely not angry about having to do this. Look at me, showing my teeth and remembering to crinkle my eyes slightly and oh look we're touching shit wipers isn't that... correct? I'm matching the amount you squeezed because that matters for some reason. I'm passing your bullshit test so I can, idk, have your approval I guess. Now I'm going to make the right amount of eye contact and ask you questions about yourself that I don't care to hear about at all, and they're going to be in this goldilocks zone where we both know I'm being completely impersonal and insincere but also gives the false impression that I care about you because that's polite I guess

Like I've never consciously realized how angry this stuff makes me. It's so draining. It's so much to remember and think about, and I don't even like most people to be honest. I'm trying to set up my life in a way where I have to do this stuff as little as possible, but the fact that I have to do it at all kind of makes me want to punch a hole in a wall
