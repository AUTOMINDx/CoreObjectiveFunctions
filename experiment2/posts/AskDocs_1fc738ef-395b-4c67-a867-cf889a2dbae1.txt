I have an extensive constellation of symptoms and labs from this past year that I've posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/qw6r4w/hopelessly_lost_about_undiagnosed_illness_dont/)

Since October 30th I've had facial swelling when I lie down, it mostly resolves when I stand back up again. Each day it gets worse, it started with just being my lips and tongue. Now it's from the top of my shoulders up and it feels to me like there's something inside of the left side of my neck. When my face is swollen it hurts to do things like smile, crinkle my nose, blink, etc.

I've only been getting a couple of hours of sleep each night because I've been sleeping at a slight incline in a recliner chair. If I fall asleep lying down the swelling is so bad that I fear I might die in my sleep. When I woke up this morning the swelling around my neck felt like I was being choked and the circulation was being cut off.

I went to the ER last week and had a chest CT, blood work, and EKG, all were normal. Negative for vena cava syndrome. 

I've been to my primary care dr, a vein surgeon, oncologist, and the ER doctor who've all basically said "that's really weird, try sleeping up right, I don't see any swelling right now" without any ideas for the cause or real plan going for diagnosis  going forward.
