Currently looking at work from home
I (20F) am looking to work from home. Mostly due to my developing crippling anxiety. Does anyone know any good work from home Jobs?? 
Id prefer part time since I'm about to be doing school, and would like to try and keep my relationship balanced. Any advice will help!
