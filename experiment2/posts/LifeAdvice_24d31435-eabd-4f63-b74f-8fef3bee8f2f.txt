I’m so cold
Okay so like I’m so bad at giving advice or even opening up. Like when someone is upset around me no matter how valid the reason I am so awkward. Painfully awkward. I Grew up in a house where if you showed any emotion everyone immediately pointed and laughed at you even if it was reasonable like someone died, you got hurt, etc. well I find this to be a problem in my relationship where my s/o is super emotionally open and always talking about their feelings and I seriously struggle so much to help. Even when I upset them I struggle to find how I did so or to be able to say sorry, as I genuinely feel as if I did nothing. So this being said, I do not want to act like that. I want to be warm and welcoming. I seriously don’t want to have kids in the future because I don’t think I can create an emotionally nurturing environment for them and don’t want to make the same mistakes my parents made. So does anyone have any advice on how I can be better at comforting people or handling people’s emotions? I really want to be able to help people emotionally but sometimes I fail to understand why people feel the way they do.
