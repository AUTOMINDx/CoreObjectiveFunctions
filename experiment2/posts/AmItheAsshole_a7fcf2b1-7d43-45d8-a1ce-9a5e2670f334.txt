AITA for telling my boyfriend I don’t want him to come in on my shifts?
I bartend/serve at a pretty busy restaurant where I handle the entire floor. It’s slower right now because it’s off season in my tourist town, but I still usually have at least half the place full at rush. 

My boyfriend keeps coming in and hanging out on my shifts. I’ve told him I don’t mind if he hangs out every now and then, especially if he’s coming in with friends, but it’s turned into he comes in every shift. He can be really distracting trying to keep up a conversation with me while I’m working and even talking to me about stuff at home while I’m working. He doesn’t drink, so I’m also losing a bar seat every time he comes in when it’s busy. 

I told him this and he got upset with me. Not angry, just bummed that I didn’t want him there as much. I told him if I came into his job and just hung out there, he wouldn’t be stoked with me either. I said he needs to respect my boundaries with work. I know he just wants to see me and hang out, but I just want to keep my work life and home life separate. 

AITA?

Edit: to be perfectly clear, he’s not stalking at all. We’ve lived together for two years. More recently, I took a job where I work five nights a week. He works 6 day shifts per week right now. Even though we live together, we only see each other awake maybe 3 times a week and it’s been really hard for us. In his head, coming in to hang for a while is his way of trying to make time to see me when our schedules conflict so much. He’s the opposite of a creep. I felt like I might be an ass because he’s trying to make time to see me, but I wasn’t as stoked on the idea as he was.
