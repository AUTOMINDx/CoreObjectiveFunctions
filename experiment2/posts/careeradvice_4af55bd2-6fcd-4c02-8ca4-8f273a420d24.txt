Unhappy in my current job after 6 months, effecting my mental/physical health, but...
I've spent the past 6 months in a job that requires me to commute 1 hour each way, and requires me to spend long hours in the office (sometimes having 12 hour days).

I knew about the commute going into the job - but underestimated the wear it would have on my mental health (and physical health) - no longer have free time after work to do the things I enjoy - and now am so exhausted at the end of the week, I don't want to do much.

My company is a global, fortune 500 company, etc. and manages various types of accounts throughout the U.S.

There is a policy within the company that allows employees to apply to other accounts within the company - after you've been on an account for at least 6 months **(which I now have met this requirement.)**

My exact same job title/role is currently being advertised on a different account within the company, except its FULLY REMOTE.

I really like my boss and he has been a great mentor during my 6 months here - but not enough to sacrifice my well-being.

I'm concerned what my boss' reaction will be if I were to tell me I wanted to apply for this other remote job after only 6 months, and that it may make me look bad.

**Really looking for different opinions on whether or not it's worth asking to change to this new role, at the potential expense of hurting my reputation with my boss/the company.**
