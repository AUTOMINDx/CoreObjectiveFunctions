Benzos
What was your guys experience with benzos for chronic dpdr? Did it help end your dpdr or did it only give you temporary relied? Do you guys think it's a safe long term solution or best to avoid? I've tried a lot of medication that hasn't worked and I'm getting desperate for some kind of relief.
