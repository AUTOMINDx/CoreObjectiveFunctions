Every time I try to keep eye contact with someone I don’t know, my brain just goes haywire
Today I was eating alone at the fast food area of a mall and I noticed a very beautiful woman was staring at me, I tried to stare for a second but just couldn’t and went back to stare at my phone, two weeks ago I had a similar situation while going back to my office after a smoke break… the list goes on, this is starting to bother me a lot, because I think this is making me miss out on meeting so many incredible women with whom I could have something beautiful, and I don’t want to miss out on that, I’m actually trying to date more but since I can’t interact with strangers I go out with girls I’ve met at collegea few years back, but I also want to start dating strangers.
I’ve had this problem before but it’s worsened a lot since the pandemic started, and I don’t really know what is it.
Granted, I’ve had some tough years and dealt with trauma from an early age, but I thought I already worked on most of my issues and had them at check.
I don’t know if there’s something wrong with me but I’m sick of feeling like this.
Does anyone else feel like this, and how do you overcome this?
