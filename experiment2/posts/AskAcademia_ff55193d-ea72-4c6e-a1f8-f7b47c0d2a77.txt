Is it a red flag when the prof doesn't return to my mail asking if Ph.D. is still available?
Hello everyone,

I saw an advertised Ph.D. position and the application period is between 25 Nov and 9 Dec. Two days ago, I sent a mail to the professor asking if it is still available and he could provide me information about the project, but he did not return yet. Is this a red flag as in that the professor may not be so professional etc.?  Sorry if this is a really stupid question. I just really liked the subject of the Ph.D. and now I am quite worried.

Edit: Thank you all for your answers. I am calmer now and will apply now :)
