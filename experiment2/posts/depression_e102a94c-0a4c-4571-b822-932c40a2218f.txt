Anyone available to talk? I need to distract myself
Hi! I just want to talk about anything. Silly questions, interesting facts, games, anime, etc. I know my english is limited but I have a severe social anxiety so I don't have anyone to talk right now. I'm feeling awful these days and I don't want to do anything stupid...

Edit: Thanks so much for the comments/ DM's. You guy made my day and I'm feeling really better now! Loved this community XDLet's keep fighting day by day &lt;3
