“When you act bad in public, people will think I’m a bad parent. Your behavior is a reflection of my parenting.”
When my mom and step dad said this, over and over again to me growing up, they were *so close* to getting it. The wires were there waiting to be connected.

Yes, I acted ‘bad’. I visibly flinched when people would raise their voice or move too fast. I had panic attacks. I did poorly in school.

All of these things would show anyone that I had bad parents. These things were a cry for help. These things should have made my parents reflect on themselves, but instead they decided they were the hurt ones and my actions were intentional. They decided a child flinching was malicious, intended to hurt their reputation. Me showing signs of being abused were punished.

The signs were there, and they were ignored by my own parents who could have realized my actions really *were* a reflection of their parenting. But instead of looking in the mirror, they broke the mirror. I don’t think I can forgive them.
