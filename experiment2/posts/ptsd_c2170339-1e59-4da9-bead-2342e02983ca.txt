Im going to my first ptsd therapy appointment this Friday. Any advice? Im kind of scared.
I have been talking to a counselor for almost a year now, and she has been absolutely amazing. But she doesn't know that much about ptsd and how you treat it. So she helped me book this appointment. 

I don't know what to expect. Should i prepare for something in particular? Or is it going to be just a normal therapy session?
