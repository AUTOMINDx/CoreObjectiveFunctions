I see no way out of this shithole my life has become
yeah the title basically explains the entire thing.  during failure I  basically  always felt comfort by telling myself in that in the end, nothing  really ever matters

just this mindset alone has always prevented me from getting better

i know it's really unhealthy but it's the only way I've ever known , because I see no possible way out of my current situation
can anyone relate?
