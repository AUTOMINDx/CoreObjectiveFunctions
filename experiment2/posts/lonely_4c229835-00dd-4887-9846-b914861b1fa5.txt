I [F22] have been on and off with someone but not your typical constant on and off but the kind like you see once every once a year to hook up randomly. I feel comfortable with this person even though I dont see them constantly or know them really but since the first time we met I felt like we clicked and we had great sexual tension as well as good conversations. After we hook up he would always lead me on and say how I was perfect for him and he wanted us to be more serious. I was always hesitant but eventually I would give in. Well its been like this for the past 3-4 years. We talk for a couple weeks and then he ghosts me. 6 months ago he hit me up to see each other and he told me that he had stopped talking to me because he experienced some hardships and he felt like he missed his chance however I told him we could only be friends and he agreed but he would lead and lead me on until we hooked up again. He kept talking to me even though I ghosted him from time to time. I wanted to feel wanted. Anyways I would give in and talk to him because I craved the intimacy. However he ended up ghosting me and I just feel so worthless and like a pos. I let my guard down and he played me again. Its sad to say but I crave that even though it was temporary I liked feeling wanted. I liked feeling that warmth from someone. I just wish I was able to meet new people Nd feel worthy. I am an idiot I know but idk if this has maybe happened to someone how do you deal?

Sorry just need some friend advice ðŸ˜ž
