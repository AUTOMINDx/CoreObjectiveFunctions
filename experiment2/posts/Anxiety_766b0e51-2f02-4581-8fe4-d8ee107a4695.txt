Worried about MS
I have mild numbness for days/weeks. First time my left leg went numb for 2 weeks but not actual numbness. I can still feel there, hot/cold, pain etc. but when I touch there, I can feel there a little, like when you sleep on your arm. It continues even I'm not anxious. Anyway it's gone but yesterday it came back again. I feel the same feeling in all of my head especially my left temple. Can it be MS or something? Should I go to neurologist?
