Is the primary assumption of language that there is such a thing as existence?
What I mean to ask is whether it may be true that for language to have meaning, it constrains us to the presupposition that there is such a thing as existence? (does this question make sense?)

I've been reading a lot of contemporary Black critical theorists and philosophers, and as a result I have come into secondary discussions of language and difference. It's often discussed that Blackness is the thing by which Whiteness has meaning. This had me thinking about language and difference more generally. It struck me as a possibility that for any language to have meaning, it must presuppose that there is such a thing as existence. I feel like that possibility has important implications for our relationship to non-existence. If language itself is rooted in some way between the dichotomy of existence and non-existence, then the ways in which we attempt to diminish our relationship to non-existence (through Black bodies, through religious conceptions of eternity, through the denial of the death's presence in our lives) may somehow diminish our experience of existence. Unfortunately, I have yet to make my way back into the canon to explore Derrida, Saussare, and Heidigger, though I intend to. In the meantime, I have this question, and would appreciate guidance on where in that canon I might find the context to approach it, or any insight one might have. Regardless, thanks for bearing through my nascent thoughts.
