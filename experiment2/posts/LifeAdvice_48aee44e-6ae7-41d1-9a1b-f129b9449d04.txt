Losing interest &amp; some other things
For the past few months ive been slowly losing interest in things i loved. I skipped out on my favorite holiday, halloween, because i wasnt feeling it this year. 
I lost interest in relationships, video games i used to play a lot, family events. I've been pushing people away, friends and family. I dont know why. The only thing i keep close to me now is my dog, and she prefers strangers more than me half the time. I dont know why. 

Some sensitive stuff ahead 

I dont know if any of this has to deal with me currently having suicidal thoughts, drinking underage, smoking, being touched at school by random students, or feeling invalidated at home. I dont want to see a therapist, as that is expensive and i dont want to feel like a burden to my family. I wouldn't see the therapist anyways.

I honestly dont know what to do anymore, any help would be appreciated
