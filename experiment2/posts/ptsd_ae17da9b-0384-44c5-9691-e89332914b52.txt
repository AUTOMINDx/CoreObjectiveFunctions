Dissociation
Dissociation for me is like a dream, a passing thought that feels like it doesn't belong to you, holding yourself as if your holding a stranger, talking to yourself like a new friend. Sometimes it's comforting, it heals the loneliness and other times it's terrifying, like living in a shell of a stranger who doesn't like you, who wants to hurt you, to kill you, who calls you names.

 It's torturous and exciting. 


Does anyone feel like this? even after using coping mechanisms, does anyone really believe it will ever stop, cause I don't.
