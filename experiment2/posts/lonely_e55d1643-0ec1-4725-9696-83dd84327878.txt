I don't want to live anymore
I feel so desperate. I don't want to be alone anymore. I have friends but i don't think they'll be able to help me. I will never truly open up to them. I've never truly opened up to anyone. I despise that fact. I don't have a friend of the opposite gender. I've had only a few. Ever. I so crave for someone i can talk everything with. I so crave for the least bit of physical affection. I've never been hugged by anyone. I so fucking crave for a real hug. I want someone to squeeze and crush my heart. I want someone to talk to, atleast someone i can listen to. I want to smile. I haven't smiled in weeks. I want someone to approach me. I don't think i have bad looks. I read books, i love cinema, i love many things. I don't think i'm uninteresting. Why can't I talk to anyone? I want someone that i can hug back. Hard. I want her to know that I will love her with every atom of my being. I feel like the loneliest guy in history of the entire world. I don't want to die. But i don't want to exist either. I want to cry but i can't. There's no tears left. I haven't been able to cry for years now. I know a girl. I think i am pretty good friends with her. Her smiles are so so pretty. But i don't think i'll be able to feel intimacy with her. Or anyone at this point. I want to open up but i can't. Even when i'm drunk. I want to stop the despair. I want to end the loneliness. I want to feel. I want to feel someone and i want her to feel me. Please. God. My heart actually fucking hurts. I want it to stop.
