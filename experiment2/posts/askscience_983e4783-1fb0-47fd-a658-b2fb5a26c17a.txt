Dear Astronomers / Physicists, could you help me understand tidally locked planets?
I'm curious about tidally locked planets orbiting red dwarves, such as GJ 581g, and their potential for sustaining atmospheres or even life.

As one side of the planet is faced away at all times from its star, do the freezing temperatures that occur prohibit an atmosphere from forming?

Also, in regards to the red dwarves the planets must be orbiting so closely, is radiation due to closer proximity also a problem?

As many have taken the time during the epidemic to explore themselves a little more, I've decided to pick up science fiction writing. As a large part of the story is placed on a tidally locked planet, it's important to me to keep things realistic in a sense. Looking forward what you guys can educate me on.
