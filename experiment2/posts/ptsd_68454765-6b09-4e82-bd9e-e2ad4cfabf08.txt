I'm ashamed of my life as a traumatized person
I feel deeply ashamed to be alive. I've lost my job, career, family, and most of my friends because of ptsd. I have to lie about how much pain I'm in. I feel like a fraud. 
I have a really fake relationship with the people in my life. I can neither tolerate most work, struggle to relate to people, and cannot hold a relationship. I'm poor, and awkward with people now. 
I have completely given up on therapy to help me, and am extremely angry at the mental health system for making my problems worse rather than better. 
If therapy worked for you great, but it's not a one size fits all system, and it has consistent me worse off. I will not entertain arguments about it. 

I'm ashamed to be alive. I wish I'd have a stroke and drop dead tbh.
