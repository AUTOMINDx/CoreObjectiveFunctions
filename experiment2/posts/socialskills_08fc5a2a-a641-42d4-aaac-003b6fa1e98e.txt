i think i have the tendency to finish everything by myself in group projects
we have a group of 3 girls and 3 guys. I guess we don’t know each other well so it been petty awkward trying to communicate over text. (someone is usually left on read) today is the night due, and nobody is saying anything and i’m shy so i finished the rest of the google doc. ( we finished the first half together) i typed out “pls correct my mistakes and change anything if you want” . I don’t want to sound too pushy and trying to do everything by myself. (although i probably am) What should i do in this situation? I know it’s bad and communication is best. I’ll try to work on it
