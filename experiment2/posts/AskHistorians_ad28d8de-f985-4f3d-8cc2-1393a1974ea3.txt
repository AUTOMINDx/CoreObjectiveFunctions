Did the communist bloc know about the Incheon landing during the Korean war?
I am reading Halbertsam's book on the Korean War and it appears that both the Soviets and the Chinese warned Kim Il Sung about the possibility of a UN amphibious landing at Incheon, deep behind the frontline. He also writes that the North Korean leader disregarded these warnings and failed to even mine the waters off the coast, let alone dedicate troops to defend against the operation. However, when Googling about it it looks like none of this is ever mentioned and I wanted to get input from historians about what the Communists thought about the possibility of enemy amphibious landings while the fighting around Pusan raged on.
