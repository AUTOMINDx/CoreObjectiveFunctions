Help with navigating a counter offer
Hi,

Just got a new job (72K/yr + title boost) my current job is going to attempt to counter offer for 80k. I think I'd prefer the new job even at the lower pay. Is there a way I could take advantage of the counter offer to up my pay at the new job? I'm unsure about etiquette. Thanks!
