I’m a sound editor at a post production house on minimum wage. Is it possible to change industries at all?
I’m 26 working as a sound editor at a fairly prestige post production house. I’m currently on a zero hour contract on a London minimum wage and I have a feeling I won’t be put on a contract with a decent salary for a while now. I know one of my seniors is also on a zero hour contract and has way more experience and expertise than me. It feels as if the people at the top are making a lot of money as they can keep the juniors on a low wage for as long as possible- it just doesn’t seem fair and it’s losing my faith in the industry completely. I just want out.

It’s depressing because I don’t even have a passion for what I do anymore and I’m not getting paid enough to budget and enjoy my life outside of work. I basically want to change industry completely but I’m worried because I only have skills as a sound editor (dialogue editing for video games, SFX etc).

I really need advice as what avenue to go down. I’m debating whether I should learn coding and look at web developer jobs or even go into labouring/construction etc.

I’m at quite a low point mentally at the moment and I currently feel trapped in my current work/life situation. Does anyone have any advice on what to do? 

Any response is greatly appreciated.
