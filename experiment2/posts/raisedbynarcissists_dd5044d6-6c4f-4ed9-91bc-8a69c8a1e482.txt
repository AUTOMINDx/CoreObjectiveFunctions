Room trashed and no apology
I (48F) have been lurking here for a while and the more I read the more I realise what my mum did to me. She passed away more than 10 years ago but her narcissism has had a huge impact on my life.

One example, I was probably 18 or 19 and a friend had picked me up and we had gone to her place. Now this was before mobile phones so my mum had the landline numbers of my friends. I hadn’t been there long and she started to call saying that I had her car keys and to come home and give them to her (important to note that it was nighttime and she wasn’t planning on driving anywhere - just wanted her keys). I told her that I didn’t and thought that was it.  

Well unfortunately that wasn’t the case and she continued to call and accuse me of having her keys. She became more and more angry and after about an hour my friend drove me home.

Well the house was quiet and I thought it was all ok. Went to my room and it was trashed. All my clothes and personal things had been taken out of my drawers and wardrobe and dumped into the middle of my room. My friend had come in with me and saw this as well.

I remember sobbing as my room had been trashed.

The next morning I realised why the house was quiet. My brother had the keys and hadn’t spoken up and let my mum do this to my this. No one ever apologised.

This was my life with them. So many more examples.
