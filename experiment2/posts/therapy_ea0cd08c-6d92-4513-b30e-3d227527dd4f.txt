Why does my self-confidence increase when I receive external negativity?
I'm quite a self-loathing person. I can be very hard on myself and often my brain tells me I'm not good enough, kind of like a little voice on my head that tells me every now and then that I'm worthless and I'll never get what I want. (Note: this isn't a voice like an auditory hallucination, more of an internal monologue)

However when I get external negativity or confrontation that same voice that would otherwise agree with whoever is confronting me suddenly flips itself and becomes very self-confident.

For an example, I am fairly insecure about my lack of romantic relationships, sometimes I vent about this online, sometimes when I vent and feel misunderstood or unheard I can become a dickhead, and then people typically imply that because of that bitterness I'll never get a romantic partner.

But the thing is when they say something like 'you'll never get a romantic partner', that voice in my head responds 'Yes I will'. The voice that would otherwise agree with the other person is suddenly reassuring me and making me feel confident. It also feels really clear in those moments, like I read it and sudden wash of 'You're fine, its all going to be ok' over me.

Why is this? Is this an observed phenomenon? I haven't seen anyone else say they have similar thought processes. Is there a name for this?

How can I get his voice of self-confidence to be louder? The only way I can do it is by seeking and inciting external negativity on the internet, and that isn't a viable long term option really. I know people here will tell me to go to therapy but that isn't a viable option for me at the moment either.

&gt;!This is mostly just a funny idea to myself, but I've been wondering if I could somehow hire a part-time hater. Someone who can call me up every now and then and tell me I ain't shit and I'm never gonna be shit so. Than I can go about my life with that confidence.!&lt;
