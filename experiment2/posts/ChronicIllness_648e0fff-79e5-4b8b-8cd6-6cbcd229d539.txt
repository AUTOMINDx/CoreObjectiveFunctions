What do you tell your doctor when they suggest tests that you can't afford without giving great reason for them?
Got a new doctor because I had to when my work insurance changed, needed a new one with new ideas anyways honestly. First appointment, I basically just dump my symptom list on him. He suggests he'd like to make sure POTS (according to Neuro) is just POTS and not my heart. suggests a heart echo. 

He also suggests a UGI (barium swallow) to see if I throw up stomach acid in the mornings because of GERD or ulcers etc. I get why this was suggested, and I get why it's the first line of defense. But the UGI alone will be about $600 for me, and it has 19% accuracy. They likely will not find anything, or will find GERD, which is a given. Then they would refer me to an endoscopy. which in turn would be more money for the same hope of some type of diagnosis. 

I don't know what to do. I'm supposed to have them both done Friday then come back to doc Mon to go over results. I'm still paying old medical bills. Bills from abdominal CT scans and all kinds of things that never found anything. Wouldn't the abdominal CT find an ulcer if that were the problem? I've had lung x-rays and all kinds of stuff in that area. Two abdominal CT's while my acid/nausea issues were at their worst. nothing found.

I'm just tired, as you guys can understand, and I'm not sure what to do. I don't want him to think I'm not listening to his suggestions, but I need to know that if I'm about to spend this much more that I am at least doing only the necessary tests. It'll take me forever to pay just the UGI off. He said it was his job to make sure I didn't do unnecessary testing, but he didn't say much else. So I assume he will still think I need both tests if I called and asked. 

What a nice birthday surprise the news of the cost of the UGI was! if that's the UGI with insurance, how much is this echo about to be? awesome.
