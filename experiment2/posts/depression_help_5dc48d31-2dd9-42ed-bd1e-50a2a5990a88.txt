One month now off SSRI’s — strange happenings
Hi folks of the most helpful subreddit I know of, how’re you today?
Me… not so great, but trying.

Previous poster here with an update.
I decided to end my contract with an online mental health provider (therapy &amp; meds) because it felt extremely unhelpful for the value.
That all said and aside, I didn’t initially feel much washout or fatigue following my decision to stop taking my medications, but I’ve noticed some other things that I can only assume are related due to the fact that they did not occur while on the three different medications I was prescribed over the last three years (second long stint with SSRI’s in my life)

Prior to 2019 I was on generic Paxil with Welbutrin, but due to shutdowns and rising costs I couldn’t keep up the WB and just took the off-brand Paxil for months… ultimately I was switched to generic Zoloft in August and felt no change, only worse over time (plus ineffective and off-putting therapy-via-Zoom sessions) and that was that — I halted my meds while house-sitting for a family member since it allowed me ‘downtime’ to adjust in a controlled environment

All said — why am I experiencing severe mood shifts, sleeplessness to a wild degree, and other ‘medication halting’ symptoms so late? I read most SSRI’s have a half-life of 5-10 days, and 99% of the components have left your body within an average of 7-21 days depending on dosage and duration taken… seems off for me, way off

TL;DR - I need your help! Could you help explain why am I just recently having wild medication (antidepressant) withdrawals if I discontinued a month ago (end of Oct 2021) and counting?

Any assistance or conversation is appreciated immensely, Happy Holidays
