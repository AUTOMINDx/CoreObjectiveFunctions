Any researches on artificial animal skin?
I see number of researches around artificial skin with medical appliance for humans. I mean, making it self-healing, sensitive and so on. Which is great. It can help number of people. 

On the other hand it seems like potential of artificial animal skin is overlooked. At least I canâ€™t find any information in this area. Artificial leather could reduce livestock and  pollution, accelerate artificial meat and replace not durable eco-leather. Artificial animal skin should also be easier and cheaper to produce comparing to skin as it should not have all properties of human skin, I guess. 

What do you think? Does it have good potential? Do you know about any researches or products in this area?
