Follow-up on a one year-old post
A year ago I posted in this sub that I had problems associating my current self to my past selves, treating my past personalities as multiple different entities.
An interesting development happened a year after that post; I found myself relating very hard to the very first version of myself that I can remember, my child self. For whatever reason it makes me feel some sense of pride, that I can relate to that pure version of myself. Another thing that happened is that I was able to carry less resentment towards the version of myself I hated the most (aka my early teenagehood self). I had wronged someone really awfully back then, and when I decided to apologize for it all, I felt that weight lift off my shoulders and I was able to become at peace, if not relate, to that version of myself.
This isn't all that relevant, just thinking out loud!
