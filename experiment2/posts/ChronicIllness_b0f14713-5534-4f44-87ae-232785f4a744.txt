Playlist I made to help cope with emo burden of chronic illness
It's mostly emo type stuff but not strictly in the emo genre, I just mean very emotional singer songwriter or indie /rock stuff that's good.  

[here it is](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJsXkkm_4SS7pGBnpwBg_wX9F0HkpsQgi)

I left off a lot of the instrumental stuff I listened to like the contemporary jazz/avant garde improv stuff and european and indian classical music, bc I was trying to make the focus on stuff that helps one cope with the most heavy awful emotional stuff in pae4icular.  Maybe I'll make a separate or bigger playlist in the future.  

This was from memory and sort of vicarious for me since the sound sensitivity.  I hope it can be of use to people
