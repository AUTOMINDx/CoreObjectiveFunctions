How to ask husband for hugs and kisses without sounding needy?
This is my throughway account.  So my husband does not ever hug or kiss me and I would like him to.  Is there a way I can ask him to without sounding needy?  I hug and snuggle with him, but he never does it back to me.  Is there any hope that with time he will do these things on his own?  Or should I just accept that it's not his thing.
