I shouldn't have tried talking with you
We share zero interests. 

We can talk about my life, but I have zero friends and have nothing going on. 

We can talk about your life, but a happy, fulfilling existence surrounded by loving people is completely foreign to me. 

We can talk about my job, but my job is pure torture and it upsets me to talk about it. 

Yes, I did get a degree, thanks for reminding me.

No, I didn't get a job in my field so I had to settle for one where I'm severely underpaid and over qualified for.

Yup, it's awkward now. Time for each of us to stare at the floor until one of us fakes a reason for needing to leave. 

You'll shuffle over to someone else that you find easier to make conversation with. 

I will crawl back to the dark cave I emerged from, wondering why I bothered trying to make things better again. 

Once again, making an effort didn't pay off. Story of my life. 

I should have locked myself away in my dark, tortured mind. 

I should have hidden away in a corner, but I chose to torture both you and me. 

I'm sorry. It's entirely my fault. 

I won't do it again.
