I feel like a goddamn superhero
For some inexplicable reason I've had no anxiety or dissociation symptoms for the past 3-4 days.

The usual brain fog, tunnel vision, ringing ears, sinking feeling in the stomach, and aversion toward uncomfortable situations...all gone. 

Everything feeling sharp fresh and vibrant again.

I had forgotten what I was missing out on. 

I have no idea why, in fact my sleep pattern has been pretty poor and I've been spending half the days alone and staring at the tv/computer screen  because there's been a heatwave and I'm on holidays. 

It goes to show how we're still at the mercy of our neuro biology and sometimes all we can do is ride the wave. 

It's gonna be frustrating when it inevitably creeps back in again, BUT it's cool to know that I can still access good times like this - I'm sure we all can...perhaps when we least expect it. 

Do any of you guys have times where your anxiety decides to leave you alone for a while?
