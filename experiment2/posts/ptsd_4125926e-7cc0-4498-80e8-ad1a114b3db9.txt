Freeze trauma response at random times?
With my therapist I’ve uncovered some repressed sexual trauma and have had ptsd ever since. 

Recently I’ve been experiencing these random periods of freezing (not being able to talk or move either at all or only a tiny bit) quite regularly. I used to be able to get triggered, feel the anxiety or hurt and try and move on, but now this happens every time I get triggered or feel really intense anxiety. 

I know I shouldn’t beat myself up about it and I know why it happens, but if anyone’s also experienced this, do you know how I can reason with myself to regain control of my body? It’s like I want to move but my body just rids me of any control. Is there any way that I can make these freezing periods shorter or just not happen at all? They’re quite debilitating and embarrassing. 

I’ve just had one in front of my parents and I feel like I look like a complete attention seeker. Also sometimes they try to move me around to ‘snap me out of it’ which can feel very scary and make things worse. Does anyone know what I could do?
