Not realizing how alone you are until you find someone and get ghosted
Before all this I had a handful of friends and didn't really talk or hang out with people but few weeks back after searching for a while for someone I finally did meet someone here and we just clicked. We started chatting for hours everyday about anything and everything, both having a ton of similarities with one another and each expressing the desire to meet and date. Then a little over a week later she starts to go dark for several days without even getting a greeting back. Had like one day of better talk before another period of silence and the last thing now said was on thanksgiving and that was only a few messages. Even when we agreed to meet up there was silence on what time though we had already had a place in mind. 
During the long periods of silence I really realized how alone I actually am. I looked forward to all our chats and the stuff I normally did before just felt boring and lonely now.
She could just be busy or not have time to get on reddit to response or something and I may be over thinking but the loneliness is just brutal. 
How long do people usually think or wait before they think or know they have been ghosted?
