Nausea and lack of appetite, despite long term PPI use
PPI’s help with keeping the acid low so when I do reflux the acid/ food it doesn’t burn much. BUT It takes a VERY long time for me to get hungry. I’ve kinda always been this way. I can go 8-12 hours without feeling hungry, but eventually I will. I also feel waves of nausea so strongly I have to lie/ sit down until I passes. It’s worse when I forget my meds. Wondering if any of you still suffer symptoms like this despite the PPI use and control of the GERD? Not sure what’s causing my nausea but I’ve lived with it so long now I’m almost used to it. Wondering if I have gastroparesis or something since it seems good stays in my stomach for so long.
