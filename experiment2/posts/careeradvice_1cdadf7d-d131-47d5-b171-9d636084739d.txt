Can I expect a similar pay increase as my last promotion?
I work at a Fortune 100 company as a Business Systems Engineer. It’s my first job out of college. I’ve been full time for about 1 and a half years. 

The way my company does “roles” or “titles” is we have different “levels” within each role. The levels are 1, 2, Senior, Lead, etc.

So some examples would be an Accountant 1 or a Senior Data Analyst.

I was hired as a Business Systems Engineer 1. I received a promoted to Business Systems Engineer 2 in March 2021. That came with about a 17% pay increase. My manager is leaving this month and they’re promoting me to Senior Business Systems Engineer. People at my company do not typically advance from a level 1 to senior position this fast. Can I still expect about a 15-20% pay increase even though my experience may be less than most seniors?

I just have a weird feeling I’m not going to get as large of a pay increase due to my experience.
