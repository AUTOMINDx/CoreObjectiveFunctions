I’m feeling broken right now and I need kind comfort words right now
I’m just having a bad day and I keep getting treated like shit by other people and all I do is just frustrated people and those who around me for unknown reason and all I tried is to optimistic and that does more harm then good and I keep asking myself this do I deserve this and maybe I do because someone like me don’t deserve happiness. I deserve to be treated like shit, I don’t deserve to have close relationship with other people, I don’t deserve to treated with respect, I guess someone like me meant to hate myself from the bottom of my heart, I’m so fucking broken, how can I keep my head up, how can I keep moving forward if everything bad happens to me?
