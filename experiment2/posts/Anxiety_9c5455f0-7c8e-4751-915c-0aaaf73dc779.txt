My Life Has Been a Blur
Im 23, and my life up to this point has been a blur.

I have been overweight for a decade.

I have a crippling fear of driving, which has prevented me from getting a license.

I failed most of the important tests in highschool that would've set me up for success after graduation.

I had the privelage of making it into Art School, but it wasn't the right fit. 

---So of course I stayed on for four years out of convenience, graduating into the middle of a Pandemic. 

What little friendships I had made there dissolved during the 2020 quarantine.

After I left school, I realized just how inept I am at life in general. 

I now live with my parents, who can barely manage taking care of themselves.

I am an adult. There are things I should be good at at this point that I am just not. 

What terrifies me is that I am the only person who can save myself, but I keep making poor decisions.

I don't trust myself anymore, and I don't know how to move forward with my life.

For all intents and purposes, I am about as capable as a 15 year old---but with treamendously less energy and optmism.

I can't take care of myself, but I'm all I have left.

Every day I wake up and become paralyzed with anxiety over how many unfortunate things I have allowed to happen either through in-action or a failure to do proper research.

I'm tired and lonely, and I could do w a brake from exsistence.

That's all.
