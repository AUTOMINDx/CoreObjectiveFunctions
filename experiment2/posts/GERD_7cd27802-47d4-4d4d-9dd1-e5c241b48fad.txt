GERD/Reflux
Hi, I had my second endoscopy yesterday (and shock they didn’t find anything again!). I have been having chest pain, throat issues, heartburn, burping etc for the last year and can’t figure out what is causing it… 

I am set to have pH and manometry soon which might find out more but I’m very confused on what’s causing my symptoms? Eating a restricted diet (oatmeal, eggs, chicken, turkey, salmon, veg, rice, potatoes) and also on PPIs so any advice would be much appreciated!
