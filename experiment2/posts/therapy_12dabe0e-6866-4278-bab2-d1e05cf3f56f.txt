Looking for online therapy
Am looking for online therapy which is affordable. Can afford at most $250 per month.

Long story short,

* I (25M) am suffering from dysthymia (8 years since MDD diagnosis, but still dull and boring).
* Never have done therapy before.
* I am not from USA, or EU, or any developed country. Therapy is not widely available in my country, at least 1 month queue just for phone therapy and in person therapy is non-existent (with even more queue time). Its like my country is saying "deal with it by yourself" to me.

Because of negative reviews on therapy, and that I have been suffering from depression for this long and that "nothing good happens in my life", like pure coincidences happen just to ruin my life, I can't trust therapy system, especially that of my country. Yes, I should've gone to therapy during these 8 years, but couldn't convince myself. Right now I really want to get better, even if there is a chance that nth therapist might be a bad therapist. 

So please help me out. I am looking for online therapy. Even if it seems like my depression is high functioning or mild, its not. I am getting tired of fighting depression. Self help books are not really my thing. I have recently lost my motivation to go exercise. I don't have ANY friends. My family is oblivious to mental health - "just live like how others are living and you'd be fine".

Right now I am deciding between BetterHelp and TalkSpace. Both have negative reviews as well as positive reviews.
