Have you gone back to a former employer?
I worked at this former employer for several years. It was a good job. Corporate environment. Great team members. Sometimes it was challenging, sometimes fulfilling, sometimes boring—depending on the workload and clients. But I overall enjoyed it and was happy there.

I left on good terms. I just wanted to go on to bigger, "better" things with more responsibility. In the past few years, I ended up in nonprofit marketing and leadership positions—and a vicious cycle of burnout. The long hours, high stress, and lack of work/life balance have caught up to me. I want a "good enough" job that allows me to clock in, do something that I'm good at, clock out, and leave work at work. 

I may have the opportunity to go back to this former employer. I'd get to do something that I know I'm already good at, but can continue to improve. I'd get to be part of a team instead of director. (I don't mind leading in certain aspects, I've found that I don't really like being the one in charge of everything.) I'd also get to work from home—and I am really my best, most focused, most creative, most productive self when working remotely.

Have you ever gone back to a former employer? Was it awkward? What did people think? (I probably shouldn't care what they think—but here I am.) I'd be curious to hear some insight and (hopefully) success stories.

Thanks!
