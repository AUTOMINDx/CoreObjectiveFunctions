How to deal with feeling like you’re going backwards in life
Recently, I (28f) ended a long term relationship, moved back in with my parents (after being on my own for 10 years), and decided I’m going back to school to start a new career. Though I know all of these steps are going to give me a better future I just can’t help but keep thinking about how I’m going backwards in life. I never expected to be completely starting over at this age and really thought that I would be married and having kids in a few years. How does one deal with internal feelings of failure (not exactly failure maybe but just not being where you thought you would be in life)? I feel like there is so much pressure now with all of my friends starting families and having promising careers and it just makes my goals of having a family and a good career seem even more unattainable. 
I’m sure I’m just putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on myself with everything but some friendly advice on how to manage these thoughts/feelings would be appreciated :)
