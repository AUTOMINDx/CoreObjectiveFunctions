Not sure how to meet people
Hi everyone, 

I'm sure you've all heard this a million times and I've read through similar posts but couldn't really find any advice that felt right for me. 

For context, I'm a 24 year old female. I've only been in serious, long term relationships but recently had my shortest stint of 5-6 months with someone. That was my first female relationship; I am bi. 

I am very introverted, I work full time and my colleagues are people mostly over 50s or well established in life. I have great friends but only a few and don't really meet others through them. 

I don't have hobbies or interests that involve other people as I like to do quiet things alone/with my dogs/close friends or exercise. When I do go out I enjoy things with one or two other people at a time and they're things that don't really facilitate new friendships/romantic relationships. 

I study as well but only online. 

I would like to avoid dating apps as I don't think I have the personality or resilience to survive in that world. 

I do experience people hitting on me but I often find they are overly egotistical and seem excessively interested in sex or flirting instead of interesting conversation and genuine connection. 

I think I am awkward and have never been able to initiate things with others, but I try to have a kind and gentle approach to people who show interest in me. This just isn't very often, thanks to an all rounded lack of opportunities. 

Considering all of this context (and apologies for any excess detail), including my wish to stay away from dating apps, does anyone have some helpful advice I can consider? I am based in Melbourne Australia. 

Thank you in advance kind strangers.
