WIBTA if I lived with my dad when my mom needs me?
My mother (37f) is 8 months pregnant. The baby daddy is long gone, and was very toxic throughout the relationship. I had told my mother that him (and her past 2 boyfriends, one turned husband) that he was toxic, but she did not believe me and it resulted in her heart being broken. multiple times. This in turn has resulted in me being her therapist and taking care of my sister when moms feeling down (I'm 13)

I recently came out as trans to her and she was accepting but only uses they/them pronouns for me when I've clarified I use he/him. She also told me that I should allow my sister to still call me sissy, even though I don't like it. This, among other things, has created a lot of stress, especially since I know that when the baby is born she will rely on me for babysitting.

I've been contemplating living with my father for months now, but I'm not sure if its selfish or not. Once the child is born, she will rely on my 9 year old sister to watch him, and I know that's not good, plus I don't want to risk hurting the baby by making her stressed, since I wont be there to help with the rest of the pregnancy. But my father is really my only support system. He gets me, and even though I haven't come out to him yet, I know he will be better than my mom. I really want to live with him, but I don't know if I should. Would I be the asshole if I were to do this?

(EDIT: My sister shares the same mom, but a different dad)
