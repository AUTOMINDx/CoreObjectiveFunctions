Is this mean, inconsiderate or normal?
When someone is angry, or frustrated by something that doesnâ€™t have anything to do with you personally, and they express it twards you by giving you an attitude, or getting short with you, is that inconsiderate or rude of them? Or is that something that everyone does and is normal? 

How do you act when this happens? Do you express how it makes you feel or just leave them alone?
