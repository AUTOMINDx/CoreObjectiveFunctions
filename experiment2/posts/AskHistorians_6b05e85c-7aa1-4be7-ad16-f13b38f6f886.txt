British views of different races during 19th Century
I feel like I've come across multiple accounts of a sort of unofficial ranking of races that the British had when colonizing the world.  I know the term martial races is one aspect, but I've also come across mentions that indigenous groups that farmed were viewed as more civilized as nomadic ones.

I'm curious, was there ever something more formal or systematic about this view?  Is there someone who is best known for these views?  Perhaps a text that kicked off this thinking? 

I'm teaching 19th century colonialism and I'm quite interested in finding some resources for students to engage with.  Most of my students are Māori, so I'm quite interested in perhaps the contrasting views of Australian indigenous compared to Māori, but I'm not picky if anyone has a book recommendation on the topic.
