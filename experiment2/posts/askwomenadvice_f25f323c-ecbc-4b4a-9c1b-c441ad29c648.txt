When is the ideal time to get a bikini/Brazilian wax for the first time before going on vacation?
I am going to Hawaii the week before Christmas for 6 days (so about 2.5 weeks away) and I would love to wear bathing suits without worrying about shaving and razor bumps. I have never waxed before. Is there an ideal time frame I should aim for when getting waxed? I leave on a Friday, if I get waxed the weekend before would that be too long of a window and hair might start to grow back while I’m on vacation? Or should I wax closer to the day I leave? I’m worried about being irritated and uncomfortable during my vacation. Am I more likely to be irritated after my first ever wax?
