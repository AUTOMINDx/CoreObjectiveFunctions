Please someone help me
I have been feeling so suicidal the past few weeks. I don’t want to go but I don’t know how to stay. I’m 21, I make 10$ an hour, my rent is 1500$, not including other bills. I tattoo apprentice because I’m trying to make something out of myself instead of struggling like I am, but it feels like such a far goal to accomplish. I doubt sometimes that I’ll be able to finish it, and I’ll fail like the other times I’ve proven to myself when I’ve set a goal. I just feel like nothing ever gets better. I’ve always struggled, and I thought that once I grew up and got my own safe space it would get better. Now I just have a plethora of other problems that make me feel even worse and more defeated than before. I’ve been dealing with substance abuse because of my depression, and now I’m even more depressed because I’ve relied on something foreign to give me a dopamine boost. I’m just so tired. I don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t even have energy to eat, I’ve had little to nothing in days.
