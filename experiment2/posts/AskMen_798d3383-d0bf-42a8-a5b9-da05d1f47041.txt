What is your favorite sock?
No, it's not a joke. The only thing my son has asked for for Christmas this year is socks. I know he's serious because he has the same addiction to new socks I have. Yes, I can make him deliriously happy with nothing more than new socks for Christmas, but I don't want just any sock. This is my son we're talking about. My first born, my only born, and too many times when he was growing up, the only reason I kept going. This is his first Christmas living on his own and I know sometimes it can feel overwhelming (hell, I've been on my own since I was 17 and it still gets overwhelming) so I want to give him the best, softest, most insanely comfortable socks I can find.

If it helps - He is in college working on his degree in environmental science and chemical engineering. He's a gamer (usually PC, but has a fondness for his first gaming system, xbox) He's a huge nerd and proudly so. He has big feet (size 13) and spends a lot of time on them at work. The softer the better, nothing too thin, but no real limit on thickness. 

From the bottom of this mom's heart, thank you in advance.
