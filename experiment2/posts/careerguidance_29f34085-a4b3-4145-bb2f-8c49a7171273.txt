Can I get some help between 2 job offers?
Hi all, looking for some advice regarding a couple different career opportunities. I am 25

(please let me know if this is not the right sub for this)

**Option 1: Current Position**

* 75k salary
* been with the company for 3 years, so a good bit of internal equity, Part of 5 and 10 year growth plans
* competitive benefits and 8% 401k match
* typical 3-5% raises and 3-5% bonuses.  

   * Raises will start getting larger in another 3 years when I reach a certain level
* Depending on time of year and project stage, some weeks I have to work 60 hours, some only 25-30

**Option 2: New Offer**

* 95k Salary
* new company, people I have talked to dont seem as "fun and personable" as current company
* Similar benefits and same 401k match at 8%
* 10% yearly bonus guaranteed with an option of 5% more based off of clients success  

   * Raises are not guaranteed yearly
* Better Work Life Balance and more structured 40 hour weeks

Travel will be the same, in a similar industry as well. It looks like option 1 will have much more future growth potential and option 2 is better financially and Work Life Balance now, but in 3-5 years, I may be making the same as if I stayed with current company

note: Getting married in the spring, buying a house soon after and hope to have a family in 4 years time, so money now is enticing
