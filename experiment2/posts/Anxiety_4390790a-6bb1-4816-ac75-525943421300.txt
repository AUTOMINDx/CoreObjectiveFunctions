Stay hydrated people!
I have the tendency to not drink enough water. 3 cups of water, that’s it. Always feel tired, have anxiety, super hyperactive, and have a headache. I’m always on the go, usually on school campus, and the water there is disgusting. Recently got myself a Brita Water Bottle, and ever since I started drinking more water, my anxiety disappeared. 

I think sharper, have more focus, less hyperactivity which overall improves my mood and help me become less anxious.

So drink up. Not an ad whatsoever for a bottle. Just drink any water. Obviously this is not some magic pill for anxiety, but I have noticed a much bigger difference in my mental health. And.. I will say that I’m proud of myself.
