Why are there lines instead of names for places and groups in Pride &amp; Prejudice? Did Jane Austen just didn't want to come up with a fictional name or was there a different reason?
So I'm halfway through P&amp;P (I'm actually enjoying it, by the way, and i usually don't like classics) and one weird thing I noticed was that in place of certain names for locations or groups, there's a line like — added in instead of an actual name. 

I'll give an example. Page 298, chapter 51 of volume 3:

"Their sister's wedding day arrived; Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return to it, by dinner-time."

Also, in chapter 50, page 296:

"It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has a promise of an ensigncy in General ——'s regiment, now quartered in the North."

There were more instances of this earlier in the book, but I think two examples are enough. I tried to look it up, but maybe i was wording my searches wrong or something, but i can't find an explanation.
