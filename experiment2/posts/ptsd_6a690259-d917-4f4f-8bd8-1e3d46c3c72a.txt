Coping with short temper/anger outburts
Its becoming an issue. I get so angry so fast at my dog, my kids, some minor inconvenience. And I end up either yelling, screaming, throwing something or crying.

I dont want to act like this. But the anger just has nowhere to go? How do you cope.

Other than therapy. I just fired my therapist and I need a break before searching for a new one.
