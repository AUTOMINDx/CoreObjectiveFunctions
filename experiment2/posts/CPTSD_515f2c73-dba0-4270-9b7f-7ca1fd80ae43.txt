I realised something, all the people I was too greatful for, who were with a "pathetic" person like me were actually the one so toxic that made me in the worst place I could be mentally and I don't know what to do anymore.
So as the title says ,it's been a while in recovery and its ups and downs and I realised something that is kind of coming forward .
So throughout my life I've never had a good social support and so over the years I had a few friends from different groups who I told everything and considered my closest ,I was so happy that atleast I have them out of the entire world and I always thanked them,I sort of felt the need to .but throughout all those years there were countless times when I had felt something was not right and maybe I'm thinking too much and overanalyzing like I always do 
But ever since I've decided to actually give healthy relationships a chance ,I saw how different friendship are and it felt so alien to me, to not always be demanded of something,not always be counseling ,not always be made to feel privileged and making them hurt.
I realised that all those danger signs Ive been ignoring and calling false alarm and criticizing myself were correct .
I'm in a dilemma now as what to do next. And honestly I'm scared to fall in these traps again and repeat the pattern all over again.
