Went to visit family and barely saw them ..
So we just moved to Colorado and we were back in Southern California for about a week for thanksgiving. We let our family know (we were housesitting so we didn’t stay with them) and told them the days we would be there w the kids and that we had only a few plans and to let us know if they wanted to do something.
My in laws never contacted us to get together, we stopped by once but my mil was super sick &amp; we didn’t want to expose the kids so we stayed for only 20min (we didn’t know she was sick until we got there). 
My brother in law and their family never reached out, and my in laws were super mad at us for not coming by mroe - even though my mil was sick and we assumed we would hear from them when things were clear. My mom only reached out for a quick hi too. We spent thanksgiving on our own, which we didn’t understand since we had a ton of family nearby.

So who’s responsibility is it to connect during a visit? Are we supposed to be making all the plans and initiating stuff? I felt like it was more on the person who we were visiting..we let them know when we were there and then just never heard from them. I’m wondering if I’m expecting too much or if I should have continued to try to plan stuff?
