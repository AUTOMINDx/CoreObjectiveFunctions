Is monogamy dead?
I feel a constant need for affirmation, affection, attention, and love from my partner. When I do not consistently have it, I feel like the metaphorical house we have built starts to tumble down brick by brick!

I love hard and want someone that can love me even harder! However, I feel that it is hard to find such a person in 2021 when monogamy(emotional and physical) is all but dead! 

Men and women, people, are so short sided in relationships. What happened to getting married young and building a forever with someone? I have found that people really and truly have a hard time committing these days! People are constantly and consistently distracted by Instagram models and the like, and are buying into a world that isregards traditional values.

Where does one go to find quality individuals with traditional values these days?
