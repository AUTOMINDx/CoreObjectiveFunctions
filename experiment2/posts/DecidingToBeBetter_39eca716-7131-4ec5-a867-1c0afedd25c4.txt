How to survive demeaning parents?
I am an adult and begin to realise that my parents tend to put me down more often than they support me emotionally. It is about small things in life usually. Sometimes it seems they want to sabbotage me, guilt me or stress the hell out of me. Our family is mostly workaholics with major education. I am the only one in direct family with two degrees. However, it often feels like my family seeks ways to degrade my character, smear and shame because I don't do something they feel entitled for. It's about morals or something stupid out of the park. Materialism is strong in our family and for me material things have little value, but they project that on me and make me stressed about materialistic things or blame for economic struggles in their life. No matter what I try to do in my career, it is wrong. I get a better job with higher wage and they come after me to pay a higher share or threaten with investigations if I refuse. If I don't have a job at all, then I am lazy and worthless. My older sibling has earned a better life with hard work, but she escaped quite early and I am now a scapegoat for them all. It has also become her family (especially, her husbands'), successful friends and us (or, well, me because parents are retired). I understand that it is my responsibility to take care of my emotional being and learn ways to protect myself. What kind of therapy deals with the issue of demeaning family? I want to reconnect with myself again and increase self-esteem. Some moments are fine, but it cuts deep during arguments.
