Lately ive been feeling low key suicidal
Im 25 im still on the path of self discovery i feel like all i recognize is my flaws i always felts isolated and depressed growing up despite having friends and family and i have severe anxiety its not as bad as my younger years but i still suffer from it. 
 
 I been feeling really down lately been listening to a lot of radio head lol but im somewhat in between a pessimist an optimist. Im a pessimist cuz i hate my life but at the same time i try to be optimistic thinking life may one day be better for me.

 Im goal oriented I want to live a good life hopefully find a better job so i can stop working dead end jobs I graduated college with a degree in crim but i decided i dont want to do that any more so im stuck working retail. Also I really want a girlfriend for the longest its been affecting my mental health because i feel like i always make mistakes and im not good enough for someone else and the fact that im getting older just makes me feel more hopeless.
 But anyways this is whats been affecting me lately i just feel burnt out so sick and tired of everything I just want to end it all I feel like someday if I keep living like this maybe I will just kill myself. I dont what that to happen and I want to try and live my best life but man shit is so hard to cope with but I’ll keep trying and I’ll do my best, hopefully things will get better and so will my mental well-being.
