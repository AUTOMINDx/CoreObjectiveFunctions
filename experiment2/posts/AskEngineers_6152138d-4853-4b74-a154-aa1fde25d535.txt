Changing industries mid-career as a mechanical engineer. Requesting advice or lessons learned from others who have done similar.
Mechanical Engineer currently working in the industry with about 9 years of experience, I do a bit of everything: project management, engineering team lead, commercial building mechanical system design, and building commissioning but primarily I do design work. 

Over the past few years has been rather tough on me mentally which was made more worse by 2020. I think important to know is that I have a disability- I know in an ideal world it's not supposed to play a role but it does present a decent barrier.

I know I have the ability to adapt and learn, love to take on challenges and new things. I am very capable when it comes to technical and hands on tasks I do struggle when it comes to interacting with others because of my disability.

How can I improve my prospects if my goal is to change industry? 
*Most of the job posting that looks interesting to me usually requires some kind of mechatronics and/or programming language knowledge, manufacturing/production assembly design, and/or fabrication experience. They also require 3-5 years of experience - I've not seen entry level positions yet unless they're internships which honestly just isn't possible right now.

Should I look into certificates related to those things? Should I look into going back to school to boost my resume while applying for those things?
