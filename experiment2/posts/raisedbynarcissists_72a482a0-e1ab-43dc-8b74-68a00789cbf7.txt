Anyone else have a hard time with illogical behavior?
I have an extremely difficult time with it, if something doesn't make logical sense, it's unpredictable. This is threatening. 

I've read that abuse victims have a hard time tolerating illogical behavior (in others). I'm wondering if it's true for others.
