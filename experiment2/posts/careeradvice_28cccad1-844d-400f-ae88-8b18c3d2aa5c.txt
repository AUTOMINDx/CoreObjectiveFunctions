How Valuable are Tradesmen?
If I were to learn a trade like plumbing or welding, how badly would I need to fuck up in order to not be able to find work? For example, say I save up money for a bit as a welder but then abruptly quit whatever company I work for in order to travel abroad. Would I be able to find work again quickly? I hear there is a major shortage of tradesmen and I was just wondering how much I could work that to my advantage.
