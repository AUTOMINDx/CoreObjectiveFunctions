Empiricism vs rationalism - I’m so confused
I’ve watched so many videos and read so many explanations, but I still don’t fully understand empiricism and rationalism. Maybe I’m a complete moron.

I took an online test (genius, I know) and one of the questions was “do you believe that we have innate knowledge or that we derive knowledge from experiences?”

Which is perhaps the most stupid question in any quiz I’ve ever taken. It’s basically “are you an empiricist or a rationalist?”

If I knew the answer to the quiz question, I wouldn’t need the f*cking quiz.

But that question doesn’t explore what either of those two things are, and they both seem like extreme positions to me.

Can anyone help?

Additional question: which do you think I am (from the description below)?

I believe we have some innate knowledge, or ‘impulses’, derived from our evolution. The desire to f*ck, for a start. Evolutionary biology is a big thing for me. I believe it drives almost everything we do.

I believe that some people are born with genes that make them more predisposed to be intelligent, or creative.

But I also believe that all of this is channelled through the prism of our experiences and interactions in society and life.

Yes, some people are born with the potential to be genii. But any number of things based on your upbringing/circumstances/background could mean that you either flourish with this disposition or go nowhere with it. And I also believe that a person of ‘normal’ genes can reach great heights, given the right circumstances.

That’s why I think that both theories are so extreme. I feel like both combine to make a human being. Nature *and* nurture, surely?

So, am I one? Or both? Or neither? 😂

Thanks you for getting through all that. Reward for best answer. Least I can do.
