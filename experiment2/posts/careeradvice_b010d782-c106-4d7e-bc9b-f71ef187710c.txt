Routine at work
How do you make yourself appreciated in a new job while putting limits on hours? (The boss works until 10pm in the evening or more).
I work for someone who considers that I should know everything, whereas I am starting out on a large number of tasks and he is very psychorigid.
Do you have any tips on how I can be efficient without getting into a habit of doing too much.
I am very motivated to perform well. If you have any constellations of routines etc...I would be happy to read you.
