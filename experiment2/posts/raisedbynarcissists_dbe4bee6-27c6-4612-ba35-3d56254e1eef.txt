You are not who your parents or anyone thinks or say you are.
That's just a fact. Sometimes I have to remind myself (right now for example), so I thought I'd remind all of you too. 

Take a moment and just experience your inner self and of how, taking information and cues from the outside world, it creates that beautiful thing that is your consciousness, everything you feel right now is real, and you are the combination of all that and more. 

You can look inside and let your feelings flow or stop them to take a look at them at times, sometimes they just pass through your fingers like water, sometimes they burn you, and other times again they bring you up like a balloon of hot air, those are human emotions, and we have a lot of different names for them, but before they were names (anger, sadness... Happiness) those emotions were just like air water and fire inside of you, and just like the real elements they have to be acknowledged and looked at so you can understand how to be near them without getting hurt. 

So maybe what some of us need is only a new diving suit, some fire resistant gloves or to fix a hole in the plane wings... We are not broken ourselves, we just lack a piece at times and we feel the world is crumbling... It's not! 


So go get yourself what you need! Asap! You deserve it.
