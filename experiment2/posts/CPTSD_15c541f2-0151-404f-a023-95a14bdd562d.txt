With the freeze/fawn response… how can you tell when you just don’t like someone?
Just yesterday, I’ve discovered something about myself: I’ve gotten so stuck in the freeze/fawn responses I never learned how it feels when I don’t like something or someone. I have always tried way too hard to adapt, fawn in order to make everyone like me, as opposed to being punished and abused. And I tried to stop. But the freeze&amp;fawn responses are so deeply engrained in my body, I have no sense of myself, no feeling, only racing thoughts about how I must do anything to avoid abandonment and anger and hate, violence altogether, around me. I cannot remember feeling any anger in my body and this intense freeze-and-people-please response has gotten me into a lot of danger (abusive situations included). Sure it was once supposed to protect me but all it currently does is recreate unhealthy scenarios and friendships with people I’m not sure I even like. So I want to become more self-aware, honest, maybe even angrier. The thing is… I can’t tell if I find someone likeable. My life was so fixated on being pleasant and likeable in order to avoid abuse, I’ve forgotten about the most important part: are they a non-dangerous, good person? Do I want to be pleasant and kind to them? Do I like them?
And I don’t know where to start. Shouldn’t I be feeling something, like a gut feeling?
What are the typical body sensations and thoughts when you find someone friendly or rather disagreeable?
