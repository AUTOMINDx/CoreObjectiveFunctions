Bloated 1+ month after taking omeprazole 20mg
Hi everyone I hope this is okay to post here - but Im wondering if anyone else has experienced what I am experiencing out of nowhere? I started medication for acid reflux in the beginning of October and stopped after two days, and around that time is when i noticed this lump in the middle of my stomach/abs area. My stomach used to be flat, and this lump is here even in the morning when my stomach is definitely flat. Iâ€™ve been to a gastronomic doctor and gynecologist and both had nothing to say. It isnâ€™t painful but it is just really bothering me. Like I donâ€™t want this lump to just be permanent?? I attached photos of me sucking my stomach in because you can really see it there. I feel like the bloating side effect from the medication should have subsided by now but it still hasnâ€™t ðŸ˜•  [photos](https://imgur.com/a/Fpw2k47)
