Supernatural
What does supernatural mean in philosophical terms? I know there are old books about it, but the thing is they still seem imprecise. An angel on flaming wings isn’t inherently a violation of nature. Any purported violation of nature relies on having a complete and accurate understanding of the laws of nature. On the other hand maybe the supernatural is orthogonal to nature, like mathematical formulas are somehow supernatural, which seems to be a fairly common intuition even if that’s not how the word supernatural is really ever used in practice.
