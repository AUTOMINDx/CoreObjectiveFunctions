Is this bruising problem after accident concerning?
Hi, my close friend needs some help understanding what's going on after an accident with a sharp object. This is her information:  
20F, 5ft 9in, 250lbs, Caucasian, yellow around laceration wound and significant bruising where the only factor had been compression bandages, 1 week, no existing medical issues, currently on estradiol and spironolactone (trans) at 1mg daily and 100mg daily respectfully, does not drink or smoke, and does not do recreational drugs.

She told me that the yellow laceration wasn't concerning but the increased bruising is a sign of lapse in proper blood flow, which the compression bandage she has should be able to prevent. She was basically in the hospital for a few hours to get staples (bare in mind, the staples were done by a university student doing them the first time. They look okay and mostly just uneven, but that might be something important). We're looking for what that bruising could mean, and if she should go see a primary care doctor, if this should be of concern or not, what we should do and what might be causing this to happen.

Here are images of the cut and of the bruising (Probably nsfw:)
