My throat just wont stop playing up
Hey,

Im 30, male, 6’2

My throat for the last year has the follow symptoms:
- sore
- tight
- small food get sucks
- multiple shallows for drinks
- feels like theres a lump (globus)
- feels like i cant shallow with the back of my moth
- feels heavy
- anti acid liquid’s make it feel numb 
- small cough chokes

As said this has been happening for a around a year.

I had a endoscope a few months before these flairs up for GERD which was conformed

I went to my local GP last week who said it was my anxiety which i Dunno to believe

She checked the back of mouth and felt my neck and said it feels fine

My biggest worry is i have the big c but i had a endoscope and it isn’t getting marginally worst.

I dunno what to do
