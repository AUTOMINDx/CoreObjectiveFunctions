I wish I had someone.
I wish I had a partner, or a friend, really anyone. I have one kind of friend but it always feels like when we start talking more they completely lose interest and it makes me feel so absolutely horrible. I have never really had friends, all my partners have been horrible to me. My life feels so shitty right now and I have been trying so hard not to admit how sad and lonely I am. But I am. I don’t even have any option to try and make friends, I don’t even think I want to. Im even gaining feelings for my one kind of friend because they are literally the only person I ever talk to, they are also my ex and our relationship sucked. I just want someone outside of my parents to talk to and hang out with and I want a partner to kiss and hug and go to movies with. I feel so alone and unlikable.
