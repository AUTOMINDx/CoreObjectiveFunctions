Does gaviscon make anyone feel worse?
I'm talking about the normal gaviscon, with 250mg of sodium alginate.  


It makes me feel bloated and gassy, and i feel like I'm gonna get reflux. I don't know why this happens. I'm gonna give it a shot again but idk.  


Maybe its because I already take PPI 2 times a day, maybe it needs acid to neutralize but PPI remove most of it.. Not sure.
