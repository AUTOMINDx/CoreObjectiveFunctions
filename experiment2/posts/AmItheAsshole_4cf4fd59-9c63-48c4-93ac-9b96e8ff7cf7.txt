AITA for being mad at my parents about this?
So, my birthday is coming up soon, and my parents got me a used PSP for my birthday gift. I was very happy but by the time they showed me the gift it was  very late and I had to go to sleep first. The next day I was excited to play on my PSP but when I booted it up it turned off after a few minutes. It turned out the PSP they bought was broken, so my parents immediately went to the store and got a refund. Here's where things go bad. After they got home I asked them when would they buy me another one, and my father said in a few weeks. I was obviously disappointed since my birthday is in a few days (9th of Dec) but I still was very happy. But later that day my mom said she discussed with my dad and said that they won't be getting me another PSP. I asked them why and they said I had already experienced it and I should cherish the memory of it, I told them that it was only on for a few minutes and I only got to boot up GTA. My mom got crossed at me and scolded me for not appreciating what I have. She told me that I will not be getting anything for my birthday and that it was my fault. I went to my room and cried(I'm 15), I didn't talk to my mom for a few hours and she said that I should be more grateful for what I have. For the record the PSP was my 3rd console. The first is a GBA SP from when my brother was 14 and the 2nd was a PS1 also for my brother. AITA?
