Bf needs “space”
I (28F) have been seeing my bf (33M) for six months, official for three. For context, this is his first serious relationship since high school because he’s never found anyone he likes very much and has been focused on his career. Things have been moving quickly (meeting families and friends, international family wedding trips, making plans in a year in advance), largely by him initiating. Out of left-field he now says he needs space because he’s not sure if he’s ready to be in a relationship and feels overwhelmed by it. Do I give him space and hope that he comes back, or rule him out of my head?
