Advice for how to tell my mom
Been struggling for three or four months now, brought on by panic disorder. Haven’t had one moment of feeling normal since. Just wondering how I can even tell anyone what’s going on when it sounds crazy. I just can’t do this alone anymore and need someone to support me though it. Advice??
