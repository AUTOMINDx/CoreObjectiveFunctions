Can my relationship recover
This is a throwaway account, as I (23 F) am so ashamed and embarrassed of what I did to my BF (23 M) tonight. I was reaching over his sleeping body to get the remote but couldn’t reach it so I had to sit up in bed and…
BAM!
I kneed him in the nuts, waking him up in the most painful way possible. I believe he passed out from the pain or went back to sleep, I’m too scared to ask. Currently on the couch in a ball of shame…
I am asking you wonderful redditors if our relationship can survive this painful experience. Everything I do to him causes him pain.

EDIT: I apologized before he passed out.
