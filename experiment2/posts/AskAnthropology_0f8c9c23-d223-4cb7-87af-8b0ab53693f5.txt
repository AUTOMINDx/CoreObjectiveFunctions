Beginners advice?
I'm planning on going to university next fall to take a course in arts from anthropology. I'm interested in what makes humans different yet similar, our ancient ancestors and the lives they left behind, and the growth of small basic things that became so enormous and relevant today. 
I'm adamant that I want to pursue this as a career, but my math has never been my top class. Also, I've never had real experience with it before. Any advice about the basics of anthropology and getting started would be helpful!
