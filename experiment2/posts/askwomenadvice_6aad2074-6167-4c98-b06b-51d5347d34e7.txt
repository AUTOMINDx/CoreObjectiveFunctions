Am I eating enough food because I'm working out? 5ft 11 200lb
Okay so ive been doing a spin class 2/3 times a week and a weight training class once a week. I'm eating on average 1500 cals a day with the right foods. 

This morning after my workout i ate a spinach, ham and cheese omlette and i have a spin class at 6pm. I know i can wait till after the class but my question is should I eat my smoothie before as I am feeling less and less hungry everyday, like im struggling to eat.

Smoothie contains, banana, kale, spinach, blueberries

Should i listen to my body and not eat until after my workout or force the Smoothie down
