My mom is suing my dad and I'm involved...
So to summarize really quick I'm a 24 year old girl and my sister is 22 my parents divorced in 2019 and live with my dad. My mom is crazy cheated on my dad and moved to another country to be with the therapist she cheated on my dad with. She's done awful things to me and my sister and one of them is MOLEST me because her bf told her to..now she's suing my dad because she's selfish and wants more money from my dad and I have to relive all of this trauma :( and for the sake of my dad I have to testify at court and basically admit she molested me...I haven't seen her in a year and my first time seeing her will be at court and I'm really dreading it...any advice? Thanks!
