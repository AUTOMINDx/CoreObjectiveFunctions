What is it like interviewing with several interviewers at the same time on Teams?
I have an interview for an engineering position coming up and the company sent me a Microsoft Teams invite and it includes 4 people not including me. So what is it like doing an interview with 4 people at the same time and also what kind of questions can I expect? One of the people is the president and another is an account manager and one is a project manager, so what are the chances of me getting technical questions despite none of the interviewers being engineers?
