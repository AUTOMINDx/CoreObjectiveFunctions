Is a trip to the USA feasible while being unable to drive?
So I've been thinking about saving up for a Holiday to the USA for some time now. But I know that America isn't very non driver friendly, would I have a bad time if I went as a non driver? Obviously it wouldn't be much of an issue if I were going to a big city like, New York. But I was thinking of visiting Oregon, specifically Portland and a few other small towns I quite like the look of.
