Do jobs exist that are both morally sound and decently well-paying?
I am a 21 y/o student at a good university in the United States. When I graduate, I plan to go into finance, but I hold some reservations for my impending career because of the role many financial institutions play in funding businesses that have caused (and will continue to cause) harm to the environment. While these reservations exist, I also hope to have a rewarding career that allows me to save money for retirement and to provide for others around me. I understand that Financial careers are among the more morally questionable, but I still struggle to find morally sound alternatives that allow for personal development and good compensation.
