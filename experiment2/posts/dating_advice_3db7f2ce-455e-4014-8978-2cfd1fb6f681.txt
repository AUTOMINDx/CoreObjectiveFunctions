Im dating with a girl 2 weeks ago and we were texting but now she doesn’t answer my msgs. Does that mean she is not interested anymore?!
I have been dating a girl and we were texting last time I texted her i asked about her and how’s her work, she asked me back then I answered i had an interview she replied what interview i told her but still no reply even “nice or good luck” after that i send her meme pic and she didn’t reply me 2days ago,  is that mean she lost interest in me or assume maybe she is busy with her work, I don’t want to text again to be annoying person but I sometimes saw her online and no reply!!
