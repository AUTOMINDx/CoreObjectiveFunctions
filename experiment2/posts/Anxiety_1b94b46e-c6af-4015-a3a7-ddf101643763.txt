Does anyone else get anxiety or very high tension when something is coming up soon (within 24 hours), and can't relax?
So this is generally like the night before if I have \*anything\* the next day that isn't something I'm actively looking forward to. An appointment or something, but not with any particular appointment. In college I would schedule my whole day around this, trying to make all of my classes in the morning, then would immediately do my homework so I could actually relax the rest of the day. If I have a couple hours between something I just cannot relax. It worked in college because I would get everything done without procrastinating, but with real adulting it's not really the move. It's not usually active anxiety, just very high tension and inability to relax.

It's definitely worse when I only have like 15 minutes before something, but I would say it can be anywhere in the 24 hour before something range.

Looking for some ways to counteract this. Going to try meditation. I think becoming overall a less anxious person will help. I'm going to try to make a list of 15 minute things I can do which should help for the short term things, but for stuff like I have 3-4 hours before something, I can't really 'dive into' something in that amount of time. Even if it's technically long enough to get a great gaming session in or to do really whatever, the fact that something's coming up prevents me from getting into that flow state.
