Hegelian Dialectics question for noobie
I'm learning about dialectics and I was wondering if I could get some clarification if I'm thinking about this the right way.

So for example keeping it simple I say:

I like apples because they taste good 

I don't like apples because they taste bad

Apples can taste both good and bad?

Is this in simplest terms the way dialectics work? Also, any resources on understanding this way of thinking would be helpful (like exercises one can).  Sorry if I completely missed the mark I really am very new to this.
