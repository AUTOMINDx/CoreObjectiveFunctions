What Is your weirdest physical symptom of anxiety? (That you're sure is the anxiety and not something else)
I've been feeling better about my health anxiety but the physical symptoms are driving me nuts lol 
My weirdest symptom Is my chin feeling tense or tight, as if my skin was too small for the chin, but if I touch it it's normal and soft lol 
Also last night it (the chin) started to feel like it was burning, and I started to get afraid of it being something related to the nerves, but I put on a guided meditation video AND the burning went AWAY like in 2 minutes, fuck my mind.
