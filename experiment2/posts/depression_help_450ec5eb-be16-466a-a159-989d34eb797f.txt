How to Deal with Lack of Motivation to Brush my Teeth
I’ve just been struggling with this for so long and I don’t have the mental energy a lot of the time. I’m also afraid of brushing my teeth. Do you guys have any tips for motivating yourself to brush your teeth? (please don’t suggest fear tactics like telling yourself no brushing will give you cavities. It doesn’t help lol, I’ve tried)
