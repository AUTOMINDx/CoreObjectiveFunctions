I want to pursue a career in (literary) academia...or do I?
I've been a hobbyist writer since I was seven and have a good lot of experience in a variety of jobs that involve writing and publishing.

Currently, I teach high school English and - pardon me tooting my own horn - I rock at it. But as much as I enjoy teaching, love my students, am rewarded by my job, I...am losing it more and more by the year. Public school politics are awful and private schools are ostensibly worse in my experience. Many of the things we purport to do "for the students," are seldom actually done. And so on.

I got into this, actually, because when I was in college, I started off in information technology, but hated it. I was tutoring writing students at the time, so thought it'd be worthwhile pursuing a degree that would help me pursue teaching English (it was always my best subject, anyway); in pursuit of that, I had some GREAT literature and writing professors, and I thought "I want their job."

"...but I should start with high school first," I thought for some reason. So I did. Had a great student teaching experience, too, so I kept at it. Most of my actual-teaching-experience has been great, too, but...well...see above.

I enjoyed those classes, though. And I enjoy teaching. I enjoyed doing historical research and dissecting complex texts based on that type of research. Do people really still do that sort of stuff for a living? Is that a field I can somehow get into?

Apologies for the disjointedness of my post, I wrote this in little snippets over the course of the past hour or so. Just wanted to get my question out there, poorly-phrased as it all may be.

Any information would be appreciated, even if it doesn't lead me to making any real decisions. Would still love to read about it.
