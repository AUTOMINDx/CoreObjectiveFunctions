The Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible describes many individuals as living well past the age of 100, with Noah living till 950 years old and Abraham living till 175 years old. Do other cultures and civilizations have ancient texts describing their forefathers as living till such unbelievable ages?
For example, are there Chinese, Sumerian, or even Incan texts describing their ancestors as living till the ages of 200, 300, 500, or more?
