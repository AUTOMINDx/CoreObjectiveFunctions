Alarming post in a FB group. (TW for possible spiritual abuse).
\*TW for spiritual abuse (I think)\*

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, all. I'm a member of a CPTSD group on Facebook, and recently I was very alarmed by a post on there, from someone claiming that their PTSD had been caused by an spirit entity attached to them, through witchcraft or divination. There were over 100 replies to the post, mostly agreeing with the OP and saying they felt the same.  Apparently many people seem to have wondered if their PTSD is caused by a malevolent entity. Someone claimed to have been affected by 22 entities, 3 of which wouldn't leave! I'm a Christian who has wondered about this sort of thing in the past, although I believe in the existence of mental health issues more than I do demons. I also believe that blaming demons lets the real culprits off the hook - those "demons" in human form who have maltreated us.

I expected a moderator to weigh in with some gentle advice, but no. I'm afraid I didn't make any comment, but I'm now giving the group the side eye. To be fair, lately I'm giving most of social media the side-eye these days because it seems to get more disturbing by the day. Most of it triggers me to heck. I had no idea what flair to give this!

Just to say that I'm NOT making fun of these people - I'm genuinely worried for them. It seems that there's a lot of spiritual abuse out there.
