Define "flashback" | TW: Abuse, Self-harm
The last little while I've been wondering if I have PTSD. I've lived through a lot for being 22, domestic abuse, homelessness, neglect, witnessing crime and terrorism, avoiding being lured by a sex offender, etc.  


I'm in a safe space now. Whether it's stable is up for debate, but for the time being at least I'm protected. I have a job, I live alone, I have privacy, really it's all I need. Yet, even though it's been nearly two years living where I'm at, *every fucking day* these memories play out in my mind in near perfect detail.  


I wouldn't describe myself as "reliving" the experience cause I don't feel like I'm physically there as I would in a dream for example, but with the level of detail and how "consistent" the memories are, sometimes it feels like I may as well be. Oftentimes a memory of something will ruin anything from hours to the entirety of my day as I'm left emotionally unhinged doing anything from angrily smashing my possessions to crying holding x chemical to my mouth.  


If it weren't for the fact that mental health diagnoses can take *years* where I live, I'd see a professional and get their thoughts, but it's hard knowing where the line is drawn as to whether or not these memories I'm struggling with would be considered flashbacks. Each memory that repeats itself has the details down *to a tee,* the lighting, facial expressions, what was said, the temperature, the exact spots everyone was at, so on so forth. However, while I do find myself stopping to process things, I am aware of my surroundings and the present moment.  


I want to know how a flashback feels for people that have been diagnosed, mainly to get a better idea as to whether or not I have PTSD or not. Is the media's general depiction of them accurate? Can they be placed on a spectrum?
