# Experiment 2

## Overview

Ongoing experiment to demonstrate Core Objective Functions in a cognitive architecture

## Proceedure

### Step 1 - Generate COF Ideas

The idea is to simplify the first step of the Core Objective Functions by simply generating lists of ideas to fit each COF. This initial step is unbound by the need to explicate, characterize, or describe the COF (which GPT-3 is capable of) because it's generally not necessary. 

### Step 2 - Integrate COF Ideas

Following the generation of COF ideas, they will be integrated with a subsequent prompt. This will be step 2 (integration). This should use information from all three COF in order to decide on an action. Obviously, this is merely generative, and does not rely on memory or recall. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that recall has already happened by this point, and that all necessary information is present. This shows how all COF can be combined into a single action, or a set of possible actions, that should satisfy all three COF.
