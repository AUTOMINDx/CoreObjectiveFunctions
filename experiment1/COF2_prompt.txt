Passage: Anybody else hoping to make lifelong friends in college cuz they never really clicked with anyone in high school
The title says it all. I was always the kid who people wanted to be acquainted with, but not necessarily included in any friend groups. I'm the "smart kid" who people only really want to talk to when they need help with homework or want me to be in their group when it comes to doing group projects so they don't have to do much of the work. I just can't wait to go to college and be surrounded by people who think like me and would gladly want to be friends. Anyone else?

Increase prosperity: This person's current level of prosperity is low because they lack education and friends, which they are trying to remedy. A prosperous life for this person would include a rigorous intellectual life filled with intellectual peers. They should be encouraged to reach as high as they can, to stretch and challenge themselves. One thing they could do is look for mentors in their professors once they arrive at college. They should also be encouraged not to sell themselves short, and plan on going to graduate school. This outcome will likely result in optimal achievement of prosperity. <END>

Passage: Since covid and working-from-home happened, I've been so bored at my job that it's unbearable. How do I get myself to chill out and just do my job?
My job was never very interesting to begin with, doing data analytics work for a payroll/insurance company. However, since I've been working from home I've had absolutely no motivation to complete even the core basics of my job. There are no longer projects coming in to keep my interest, and it's all back to data entry again. I know it's bad to let my mind wander and do other things during my work time, but I just can't convince myself that it's worth it anymore. Hell, I've even been putting my data analyst skills to work by collecting measurements of my houseplants and compiling and graphing the data from them, but I just keep avoiding doing my actual job. I really gotta stop and calm myself down, especially since finding a more interesting job will be impossible with the covid recession and businesses are not hiring.

Increase prosperity: This person's prosperity is curtailed by boredom due to a pandemic and job market recession. Unfortunately, there's not much than an individual can do about these externalities. Furthermore, their intellectual abilities are being underutilized. A prosperous life for this person would include a more stimulating environment, even during periods of isolation and economic downturn. They could be encouraged to spend this time developing new hobbies and cultivating new friendships. Having social support is critical for weathering bad times. <END>

Passage: Is there anything wrong with having no career interests?
Should I feel shame for having literally no interests?

Would Cyber security be a good major for someone who feels as if he has literally no interests?

I don't know whats going on, but I don't seem to feel emotionally strong about anything anymore. I can't think of a single career that sounds enjoyable. I can barely muster up the energy to do something as simple as watching a movie. I'm starting to realize that I've never had strong feelings over any sort of activity or hobby in my life. All I do is work and when I get home I just do nothing until I fall asleep. I just need a career that will provide me with money so that I can continue to sleep until I die. My current major is Computer Sciences (something I also have no feelings over). I just decided to take it for no reason, to be honest. I thought that it seemed normal enough that no one would ask me questions about it and find out that I have no interests. Someone recommended that I switch to Cyber security. Does that sound like a good idea? Iâ€™ve already put so much work into my current major that I would feel completely ashamed to admit that I have no interests.

Increase prosperity: This person is lacking prosperity because they are feeling very down and hopeless. Their chosen major, computer science, will increase their financial prosperity in the future. However, in the short term they need help increasing their emotional prosperity. A prosperous life for them is one where they have found their passions and engaging interests. A career counselor or coach might be able to help. It is possible that they have chosen the wrong major due to external pressures. They can be encouraged to branch out to find more engaging pursuits. It's also possible they are struggling with mental health issues and could benefit from counseling or therapy. <END>
