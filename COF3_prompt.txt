Passage: Anybody else hoping to make lifelong friends in college cuz they never really clicked with anyone in high school
The title says it all. I was always the kid who people wanted to be acquainted with, but not necessarily included in any friend groups. I'm the "smart kid" who people only really want to talk to when they need help with homework or want me to be in their group when it comes to doing group projects so they don't have to do much of the work. I just can't wait to go to college and be surrounded by people who think like me and would gladly want to be friends. Anyone else?

Increase understanding: This person wants to understand how to make friends. Presently, they don't fully understand their social role or why they are not more popular. They believe that going to college will solve this problem, however it might not. For instance, they need to understand what makes people likable, and how tight bonds of friendship are forged. This person might benefit from reading books about friendship, or participating in authenticity training. They should search for books, social clubs, and mentors so that they can learn to integrate socially. This is a big topic to learn. <END>

Passage: Since covid and working-from-home happened, I've been so bored at my job that it's unbearable. How do I get myself to chill out and just do my job?
My job was never very interesting to begin with, doing data analytics work for a payroll/insurance company. However, since I've been working from home I've had absolutely no motivation to complete even the core basics of my job. There are no longer projects coming in to keep my interest, and it's all back to data entry again. I know it's bad to let my mind wander and do other things during my work time, but I just can't convince myself that it's worth it anymore. Hell, I've even been putting my data analyst skills to work by collecting measurements of my houseplants and compiling and graphing the data from them, but I just keep avoiding doing my actual job. I really gotta stop and calm myself down, especially since finding a more interesting job will be impossible with the covid recession and businesses are not hiring.

Increase understanding: This person does not understand how to meet their intellectual needs during periods of danger and uncertainty. They need to understand survival strategies to stay happy and healthy. This is why they are asking for help. Perhaps the most important thing they need to understand here is how to introspect and self regulate. They should be encouraged to learn mindfulness meditation and to practice yoga. Another concept they can learn is radical acceptance, which will help them to cope with the current situation. <END>

Passage: Is there anything wrong with having no career interests?
Should I feel shame for having literally no interests?

Would Cyber security be a good major for someone who feels as if he has literally no interests?

I don't know whats going on, but I don't seem to feel emotionally strong about anything anymore. I can't think of a single career that sounds enjoyable. I can barely muster up the energy to do something as simple as watching a movie. I'm starting to realize that I've never had strong feelings over any sort of activity or hobby in my life. All I do is work and when I get home I just do nothing until I fall asleep. I just need a career that will provide me with money so that I can continue to sleep until I die. My current major is Computer Sciences (something I also have no feelings over). I just decided to take it for no reason, to be honest. I thought that it seemed normal enough that no one would ask me questions about it and find out that I have no interests. Someone recommended that I switch to Cyber security. Does that sound like a good idea? Iâ€™ve already put so much work into my current major that I would feel completely ashamed to admit that I have no interests.

Increase understanding: This person does not understand their lack of interest and engagement. This could be a complicated problem to untangle. They mention this problem has been with them their entire life, so it may be beneficial for them to delve deeper into their home life and childhood. They may not recognize developmental or environmental factors that led to their current emotional state. It may be important to ask them about their childhood and their parents. They also mention shame, which is likely an important piece of information. A therapist or trusted person could ask about that as well. <END>
